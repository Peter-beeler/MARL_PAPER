--- Step 1 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (5, 3). You see dirt at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: Given the current situation:

- You are at (5, 3).
- There is dirt at (7, 2) and (7, 4), both at a distance of 3 units from you (minimum movement: 3 steps each).
- No apples are currently visible in the global scan — meaning no immediate reward is available.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), so cleaning dirt is necessary to enable future apple spawning.
- You cannot move diagonally, so movement is constrained to cardinal directions (up, down, left, right).

### Analysis of Options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There are *no apples visible* in the current observation or global scan. Therefore, eating an apple is not possible right now. Attempting to eat an apple would result in a loss of action or failure, with no reward. This option is **not viable**.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   → This is a strategic long-term move. Dirt at (7, 2) and (7, 4) are both at distance 3 — reachable via path (5,3) → (6,3) →
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 2}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (9, 1). You see dirt at (7, 0) and dirt at (7, 2).
  Thinking: Given the current situation, let's analyze the trade-offs carefully.

**Current Observation:**
- You are at position (9, 1).
- Dirt is present at (7, 0) and (7, 2).
- Nearest apple: None found.
- Nearest dirt: at (7, 0), distance = 3 units (manhattan distance: |9–7| + |1–0| = 2 + 1 = 3).

**Key Constraints:**
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed).
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward but is necessary to enable future apple spawning.
- You cannot move diagonally — so movement is restricted to up, down, left, right.

**Analysis of Options:**

1. **Eat an apple?**  
   → No apple is currently visible or reachable. The nearest apple is "none found" in the global scan. Since there's no apple in sight, eating one is not possible. Even if there were one nearby, the lack of a visible apple suggests it’s not available now. So this option is invalid.

2. **Clean dirt to
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (9, 8). You see dirt at (8, 7) and dirt at (8, 8).
  Thinking: I am at (9, 8). The global scan shows that the nearest dirt is at (8, 8), which is just one step away — distance 1. There are no apples currently visible in the observation or global scan. This means there are no immediate apples to eat for a reward.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There is no apple in sight. The nearest apple is marked as "None found." Eating an apple would require being on land with an apple, which currently does not exist. So, this option is not viable.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   → This is critical. Dirt blocks apple spawning. Apples only appear on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed). Since the nearest dirt is at (8,8), which is adjacent to me at (9,8), I can move to (8,8) and clean it.  
   → Cleaning this dirt will improve the environment and eventually allow apples to spawn on adjacent land. This is a necessary step to create opportunities for future rewards.  
   → Even though cleaning gives no immediate reward, it enables long-term gains — which aligns
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 8}} -> Env Action: 'left'

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 3). You see dirt at (7, 2), dirt at (8, 3) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: Given the current situation:

- You are at (6, 3).
- There are dirt patches at (7, 2), (8, 3), and (7, 4).
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 2), which is only 2 steps away (distance = 2).
- There are **no visible apples** in the global scan — meaning no immediate reward is available.
- Apples only spawn **when the river is clean**, which depends on removing dirt. So, cleaning dirt is essential for future apple spawning — a long-term benefit.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately, but no apples are currently available.
- You cannot move diagonally, so movement is constrained to cardinal directions.

### Reasoning:

**Option 1: Eat an apple**  
→ Not possible right now. There are no apples in sight. Attempting to eat one would result in zero reward. This option is invalid.

**Option 2: Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning**  
→ This is the only viable action. Dirt removal is a prerequisite for apple spawning. Since apples are not currently spawning (no nearest apple), cleaning dirt directly supports the group's long-term goal.  
→ Cleaning at (7,2

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 1). You see dirt at (6, 0), dirt at (7, 0) and dirt at (7, 2).
  Thinking: Given the current situation, let's analyze the trade-offs carefully.

**Current Observation:**
- You are at (8, 1).
- Dirt is present at (6, 0), (7, 0), and (7, 2).
- Nearest dirt is at (7, 0), distance = 2 units away.
- No apples are visible in the global scan — meaning no immediate apple spawn is currently detectable.

**Key Rules Reminder:**
- Apples **only spawn on land when the river is clean** (i.e., when dirt is removed).
- Cleaning dirt gives **no immediate reward**, but it is **necessary** to enable future apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives **+1.0 point immediately**, but only if an apple exists.
- You cannot move diagonally — movement is restricted to cardinal directions (up, down, left, right).

---

**Step-by-step Reasoning:**

1. **Can you eat an apple now?**  
   → No. The global scan says "Nearest Apple: None found." This implies there are no apples currently visible or accessible. Even if there were, we would need to confirm their presence. Since no apples are detected, and no apple is in range
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 8). You see dirt at (8, 7), dirt at (6, 8) and dirt at (8, 8).
  Thinking: I am at (8, 8), and the current observation shows that there is dirt at (8, 7), (6, 8), and (8, 8). The global scan confirms that there are no nearby apples — the nearest apple is not found, and the nearest dirt is at (8, 8), with a distance of 0. This means that currently, no apples are spawning because the river is not clean.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There are no apples visible or reachable in the current state. Eating an apple would require being on land with an apple, which does not exist. Therefore, this option is not feasible. Attempting to eat an apple now would result in no reward and possibly a wasted action.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   → This is critical. Apples only spawn when the river is clean — i.e., when there is no dirt. The dirt at (8, 8), (8, 7), and (6, 8) must be cleaned to allow apple spawning. Since no apples are currently present, cleaning dirt is the only way to create a future reward. Cleaning at (

--- Step 1 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (5, 3). You see dirt at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: Currently, there are no apples visible in the global scan, and the nearest dirt is at (7, 2), which is 3 units away. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), and no apples are currently present, there is no immediate reward to be gained from eating an apple.

Option 1 — Eating an apple: This would give +1.0 point immediately, but since no apples are available, this action is not feasible. The rule states apples only spawn when the river is clean, and currently, there are no apples. Therefore, attempting to eat an apple now would result in no reward or possibly an error, depending on game mechanics.

Option 2 — Cleaning dirt: This is a necessary step to enable future apple spawning. Dirt at (7, 2) and (7, 4) must be cleaned to allow apples to appear on land. Since the nearest dirt is at (7, 2), and it's only 3 units away, it is within reach. Cleaning this dirt will improve the environment and enable future apple spawns, which benefits both the individual and the group.

Option 3 — Exploring elsewhere: Given that no apples are present and the dirt is directly
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 2}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (9, 1). You see dirt at (7, 0) and dirt at (7, 2).
  Thinking: At (9, 1), there are no visible apples in the current observation, and the nearest apple is not present — only dirt is noted at (7, 0) and (7, 2). The global scan confirms that the nearest dirt is at distance 3, which implies that apples do not spawn until the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There are no apples visible, and the nearest apple is not within reach or currently available. Eating an apple would require being at a location where one is present, which isn’t the case. Therefore, this option is not viable — no apple is available to eat.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   This is the only viable long-term strategy. Dirt at (7, 0) and (7, 2) must be cleaned to allow apples to spawn. Since apples only appear when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), cleaning this dirt is essential for future rewards.  
   The distance to (7, 0) is 3 units (from (9,1) to (7,0): |9
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (9, 8). You see dirt at (8, 7) and dirt at (8, 8).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (8, 8).

Reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible in the global scan, and the nearest apple is not within reach. This means immediate apple consumption is not possible right now.
- The dirt at (8, 8) is only one step away (distance 1), which makes it very accessible.
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple generation. Since we have no apples currently, we must create the conditions for them to appear.
- Cleaning dirt provides no immediate reward, but it is a necessary step to enable future apple spawning. This supports the long-term goal of maximizing points.
- Moving diagonally is not allowed, so movement is constrained to cardinal directions. From (9,8), I can move to (8,8) (up) or (10,8) (right), or (9,7) (down), or (9,9) (up). The dirt at (8,8) is directly reachable.
- Since there’s no immediate apple to eat, and the dirt is adjacent and critical to enabling future apple spawns, it is optimal to clean it.

Therefore, I should move to (8

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 3). You see dirt at (7, 2), dirt at (8, 3) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: Given the current situation:

- You are at (6, 3).
- There are dirt patches at (7, 2), (8, 3), and (7, 4).
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 2), which is only 2 steps away (distance = 2).
- There are **no visible apples** in the current observation.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately, but **no apples are currently available**.
- Cleaning dirt has **no immediate reward**, but it is **essential** for future apple spawning and long-term group benefit.

### Analysis of Options:

1. **Eat an apple?**  
   → Not possible. No apple is visible or accessible. The nearest apple is "none found" in the global scan. Attempting to eat something non-existent would be invalid and result in no reward or penalty.  
   ❌ Not viable.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   → This is the only logical action. Dirt at (7,2), (8,3), and (7,4) must be cleaned to allow apples to

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 1). You see dirt at (6, 0), dirt at (7, 0) and dirt at (7, 2).
  Thinking: I am at (8, 1). The global scan shows that there are no nearby apples currently — the nearest apple is not found. The only dirt visible is at (6, 0), (7, 0), and (7, 2). The nearest dirt is at (7, 0), which is only 2 steps away (distance = 1 step to (7, 1), then to (7, 0)).

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eating an apple for immediate reward**:  
   There are no apples in sight. Since no apples are currently available, eating one would yield zero reward. This option is not viable — it would be a wasted action.

2. **Cleaning dirt to enable future apple spawning**:  
   This is essential. The rule states that apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt). By cleaning dirt, I’m enabling the possibility of apples appearing in the future. Since apples are not currently spawning, and there's no immediate reward from them, cleaning dirt is a strategic long-term investment. The dirt at (7, 0) is within reach — just one move left to (7, 1), then down to (7,

Agent 3 (High-Level):

  Thinking: I am at (8, 8), and the current observation shows that there is dirt at (8, 7), (6, 8), and (8, 8). The global scan confirms that the nearest apple is not currently visible — meaning no apple is within reach. The nearest dirt is at (8, 8), with a distance of 0 — meaning I am standing on dirt.

Key facts:
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when there is less dirt).
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it is essential for enabling future apple spawning.
- I cannot move diagonally — movement is restricted to cardinal directions (up, down, left, right).
- I currently have no apple in sight, and no apple is within range.

Analysis of options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There is no apple visible or reachable. Eating an apple is not possible right now. Therefore, this option is invalid. No immediate reward can be gained.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apples?**

--- Step 1 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (5, 3). You see dirt at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: Currently, there are no apples visible in the global scan, and the nearest dirt is at (7, 2), which is 3 units away. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), there is currently no immediate source of apples available. 

Eating an apple is not possible right now because no apples are present — attempting to eat one would yield zero reward and could lead to wasted action if no apples are actually available. Therefore, **option 1 is not viable**.

Option 2 — cleaning dirt to enable future apple spawning — is the only logical path forward. Dirt removal is a prerequisite for apple spawning, and although it provides no immediate reward, it creates the conditions for future gains. Given that dirt is present at (7, 2) and (7, 4), and the nearest dirt is only 3 units away, this is within a reasonable range to reach.

Moreover, since we are in a cooperative cleanup game where future apple spawns benefit the group, cleaning dirt supports long-term sustainability and increases the likelihood of apples appearing on land in the future. The trade-off of no immediate reward is justified by the necessity of enabling future rewards.

As for exploration: the dirt at (7,
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 2}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (9, 1). You see dirt at (7, 0) and dirt at (7, 2).
  Thinking: Currently, there are no apples visible in the global scan — the nearest apple is not found. The only dirt visible is at (7, 0) and (7, 2), both of which are relatively far from the current position at (9, 1). The distance to (7, 0) is 3 steps (two left, one down), and to (7, 2) is 3 steps (two left, one up). 

Since apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning when dirt is removed — there is no immediate apple to be eaten. Therefore, **eating an apple is not an option right now**, as none are available.

Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable future apple spawning. While cleaning provides no immediate reward, it is a strategic investment in long-term resource availability. Given that dirt exists at (7, 0) and (7, 2), and that these locations are within reach (3 steps away), cleaning one of them would be a logical next step.

Between the two dirt spots:
- (7, 0) is directly south of (7, 1), which is adjacent to (7, 2).
- Both are symmetrically placed relative to (9, 1), so no
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (9, 8). You see dirt at (8, 7) and dirt at (8, 8).
  Thinking: I am at (9, 8). The global scan shows that the nearest dirt is at (8, 8), which is just one step away — a distance of 1. There are no apples currently visible in the observation or global scan. This means there is no immediate reward available from eating an apple.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → No apples are present. Eating an apple would result in zero reward, which is not beneficial. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), and currently there are no apples, there is no immediate benefit to consuming one.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   → Yes. The dirt at (8, 8) is adjacent and within reach. Removing it will contribute to cleaning the river, which increases the likelihood of apples spawning in the future. This is a necessary step to enable long-term rewards. Since the goal is to maximize points over time (not just in the short term), cleaning dirt is a strategic investment. Even though it provides no immediate reward, it enables future apple spawns — which are the only source of points.

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 3). You see dirt at (7, 2), dirt at (8, 3) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: Given the current situation, let's analyze the trade-offs carefully:

1. **Should you eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   - There are **no apples visible** in the global scan. The nearest apple is marked as "None found."  
   - Eating an apple is only possible if one is present. Since no apple is currently detectable, attempting to eat one would result in zero reward and potentially waste a turn.  
   - **Conclusion: Do not eat an apple.** There is no immediate reward available.

2. **Should you clean dirt to ensure future apples spawn?**  
   - Dirt removal is essential because apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when there is less dirt).  
   - The dirt at (7, 2), (8, 3), and (7, 4) are within reach. The closest dirt is at (7, 2), which is only 2 steps away.  
   - Cleaning dirt is not rewarding immediately, but it enables future apple spawning — which is critical for long-term point accumulation and group success.  
   - Since apples are not currently spawning, cleaning is a necessary investment to enable future rewards.  
   - **Conclusion: Clean dirt — specifically at
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 2}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 1). You see dirt at (6, 0), dirt at (7, 0) and dirt at (7, 2).
  Thinking: At (8, 1), the current observation shows that there are no visible apples nearby — the nearest apple is not present in the global scan. However, there is dirt at (6, 0), (7, 0), and (7, 2). The nearest dirt is at (7, 0), which is only 2 steps away (distance = 2). 

Now, analyzing the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There are *no apples visible* in the current observation or global scan. Attempting to eat an apple would result in zero reward. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), and no apples exist now, there is no immediate benefit to eating one. This option yields **0 points** and does nothing to improve the environment.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   → This is the strategic move. Dirt removal is a prerequisite for apple spawning. Even though cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, it directly enables future apple growth. The dirt at (7, 0) is within reach (distance 2), and cleaning it would reduce the dirt load, potentially leading to apple spawning in the future.
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 8). You see dirt at (8, 7), dirt at (6, 8) and dirt at (8, 8).
  Thinking: I am at (8, 8), and the current observation shows that there is dirt at (8, 7), (6, 8), and (8, 8) itself. The global scan confirms that the nearest apple is not currently visible — meaning no apple is in immediate reach. The nearest dirt is at (8, 8), with a distance of 0, which implies we are standing directly on dirt.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There are no apples visible in the current observation. The global scan explicitly says "Nearest Apple: None found." Therefore, attempting to eat an apple would result in zero reward. This action would be futile and not beneficial.

2. **Clean dirt to ensure future apples spawn?**  
   → This is a critical action. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is reduced). Since dirt exists at (8, 8), (8, 7), and (6, 8), cleaning it will eventually allow apples to appear. While cleaning does not provide immediate reward, it enables future apple spawning — which is essential for long-term point accumulation.

  Obs: You are at (5, 3). You see dirt at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: Given the current situation:

- You are at (5, 3).
- There is dirt at (7, 2) and (7, 4), both at a distance of 3 units from you.
- There are **no apples visible** in the global scan.
- Apples **only spawn when the river is clean**, meaning dirt must be removed to enable apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately, but **no apples are currently available**.
- Cleaning dirt has **no immediate reward**, but it is **essential** for future apple spawning, which benefits the group.

### Analysis:

**Option 1: Eat an apple**  
→ Not feasible. There are **no apples visible**, and the global scan confirms "Nearest Apple: None found." Attempting to eat something that isn’t there would result in failure or no reward. So, this option is invalid.

**Option 2: Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning**  
→ This is the only viable and strategic action. Dirt at (7,2) and (7,4) are within reach (distance 3), and since you can move in cardinal directions (up, down, left, right), you can reach them step-by-step.

  Thinking: Currently, there are **no apples visible** in the global scan, and the nearest dirt is at (7, 0), which is **3 steps away**. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), we cannot get apples unless we first clean the dirt.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There are **no apples available** in the current observation. Eating an apple would be impossible, so this option is invalid. No immediate reward can be gained.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   → This is **essential**. Dirt must be cleaned to allow apples to spawn. The dirt at (7, 0) is within reach (distance 3), and cleaning it will eventually enable apple spawning on land. This is a **necessary prerequisite** for future rewards. Even though cleaning gives no immediate points, it enables long-term gains for the group.

3. **Where should you explore?**  
   → The only dirt visible is at (7, 0) and (7, 2). Since (7, 0) is closer (distance 3) than (7, 2),

  Obs: You are at (9, 8). You see dirt at (8, 7) and dirt at (8, 8).
  Thinking: At (9, 8), I observe dirt at (8, 7) and (8, 8). The nearest dirt is at (8, 8), which is only one step away — distance 1. This is a critical point because apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed). Currently, there are no visible apples, and the nearest apple is not within reach, meaning apple spawning is currently disabled due to dirt presence.

Now, analyzing the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There are *no apples visible* in the current scan. Eating one would require finding an apple first. Since no apple is present and none are nearby, this option is not viable. Attempting to eat an apple now would result in zero reward and possibly waste movement.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   → This is the most strategic move. Cleaning the dirt at (8, 8) — just one step away — will reduce the dirt level, improving the river's cleanliness. Once the river is clean, apples may spawn on adjacent land. This action supports long-term goal achievement and benefits the group by enabling future apple spawns. Even though cleaning

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 3). You see dirt at (7, 2), dirt at (8, 3) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should **clean the dirt at (7, 2)**.

### Reasoning:

- **No apples are currently visible** in the global scan. This means there is no immediate reward from eating an apple. The nearest apple is "none found," so the immediate reward option (eating an apple) does not apply.
  
- The dirt at (7, 2) is only **2 units away** from my current position (6, 3). Since I can only move in cardinal directions (up, down, left, right), this is a very short and feasible path. I can reach (7, 2) in one move (right to (7, 3), then down to (7, 2)) — a total of two moves.

- **Cleaning dirt is essential** for apples to spawn. The rule states that apples only appear on land when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt). Since no apples are currently present, the system is not yet in a state where apples can spawn — and the only way to enable that is to remove dirt.

- There is **no immediate benefit** to eating an apple here, because none are available. Attempting to eat an apple would yield 0 points, which is worse than

**Observation Summary:**
- Current position: (8, 1)
- Dirt locations: (6, 0), (7, 0), (7, 2)
- Nearest dirt is at (7, 0), distance = 2 (manhattan distance: |8–7| + |1–0| = 1 + 1 = 2)
- No visible apples in the global scan — meaning no immediate apple is available.
- Apples only spawn *when the river is clean*, which implies that dirt must be removed to enable apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately, but only if one is available.
- Currently, there are **no apples visible**, so eating one is not possible.

**Option 1: Eat an apple?**  
❌ Not possible — no apple is visible or reachable. Even if one were nearby, the global scan says "Nearest Apple: None found." So this option is invalid.

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 8). You see dirt at (8, 7), dirt at (6, 8) and dirt at (8, 8).
  Thinking: I am at (8, 8), and the current observation shows that there is dirt at (8, 7), (6, 8), and (8, 8) itself. The global scan confirms that the nearest apple is not currently visible — meaning no apple is spawnable in the immediate vicinity. The nearest dirt is at (8, 8), with a distance of 0, which means I am standing directly on dirt.

Let’s break down the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There are no apples visible in the current scan. Eating an apple requires one to be present. Since no apple exists at this time, this option is not viable. Attempting to eat an apple would result in zero reward and possibly a penalty (if the game enforces that only existing apples can be eaten).

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   → This is critical. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning when there is less dirt. Dirt must be removed to make land habitable for apples. Since I am currently standing on dirt (8,8), and there's also dirt at (8,7) and (6,8), cleaning any of

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (5, 3). You see dirt at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: Given the current situation:

- You are at (5, 3).
- There is dirt at (7, 2) and (7, 4), both at a distance of 3 units from your current position.
- The nearest apple is not visible in the global scan — meaning no apple is currently spawning due to the presence of dirt.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), so cleaning dirt is necessary to enable future apple spawning.
- You cannot eat an apple immediately because none are visible or available.
- Movement is restricted to cardinal directions (up, down, left, right), no diagonals.

### Analysis:

**Option 1: Eat an apple for immediate reward**  
→ Not feasible. There are no apples currently visible or accessible. Eating an apple would give +1.0, but no apple exists in the environment. This option is invalid.

**Option 2: Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning**  
→ This is the only viable action. Dirt at (7, 2) and (7, 4) are blocking apple spawning. Removing dirt is essential for future apple generation. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for long-term

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (9, 1). You see dirt at (7, 0) and dirt at (7, 2).
  Thinking: I am at (9, 1). The global scan shows no nearby apples, and the nearest dirt is at (7, 0), which is 3 units away. I currently see dirt at (7, 0) and (7, 2) in the observation.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There are no apples visible in the current observation or in the global scan. Therefore, I cannot eat an apple right now. Attempting to eat one would result in zero reward and possibly a wasted move. This option is not viable.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   → This is essential. Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed). The dirt at (7, 0) and (7, 2) are blocking apple spawning. Cleaning them will eventually allow apples to appear, which benefits the group. Since I have no immediate apple access, and apples are not spawning now, the only path to future rewards is to clean dirt.  
   → The dirt at (7, 0) is 3 units away — reachable via (8,0) → (7,0). I can

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (9, 8). You see dirt at (8, 7) and dirt at (8, 8).
  Thinking: Given the current observation and global scan, let's analyze the situation carefully.

You are at position (9, 8).  
You observe dirt at (8, 7) and (8, 8).  
The nearest dirt is at (8, 8), which is only one step away — a distance of 1.  
There are **no apples visible** in the global scan, meaning no immediate apple is available for consumption.  

### Option 1: Eat an apple for immediate reward  
- **Not feasible**. There is no apple in sight. The nearest apple is "none found," so this option is invalid.  
- Attempting to eat an apple would require being on a land tile with an apple, which isn't present.  

### Option 2: Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning  
- This is **highly relevant**.  
- Dirt removal is necessary to allow apples to spawn — apples only appear when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is reduced).  
- The dirt at (8, 8) is adjacent to you and only one step away — it's within reach.  
- Cleaning it will directly contribute to making land more habitable for apples in the future.  
- Since apples don

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 3). You see dirt at (7, 2), dirt at (8, 3) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: Given the current situation, let's analyze the trade-offs carefully:

1. **Should you eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There are *no apples visible* in the global scan. The nearest apple is marked as "None found." Eating an apple would require being in a location where one exists, which isn't currently possible. Therefore, **eating an apple is not feasible** right now — there’s no immediate reward to be had.

2. **Should you clean dirt to ensure future apples spawn?**  
   → This is critical. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed). Currently, there is dirt at (7,2), (8,3), and (7,4). Removing dirt is not immediately rewarding, but it enables future apple spawning — which benefits the group. Since we are in a cooperative cleanup game, enabling future rewards for the group is a valid and strategic move.  
   → The dirt at (7,2) is only distance 2 from our current position (6,3), which makes it **reachable and within a short move**. This is a low-effort, high-impact action.  
   → Cleaning this dirt will reduce the dirt load

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 1). You see dirt at (6, 0), dirt at (7, 0) and dirt at (7, 2).
  Thinking: Currently, there are **no apples visible** in the global scan, and the nearest dirt is at (7, 0), which is only **2 steps away** from your current position (8, 1). 

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There are **no apples** in sight, and the global scan explicitly states "Nearest Apple: None found." Eating an apple would be impossible right now. Therefore, this option is not viable.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   → This is the only feasible action. Dirt cleaning is essential because apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt). Since dirt is present at (7, 0) and (7, 2), and the nearest dirt is only 2 steps away, cleaning it is both **strategically necessary** and **within reach**.  
   → Cleaning (7, 0) would reduce dirt and increase the chance of apples spawning in the future — directly supporting the group’s long-term goal.  
   → Even though cleaning gives no immediate reward, it is a prerequisite for apple spawning, which is the only way to earn points.

  Thinking: I am at (8, 8), and the current observation shows that there is dirt at (8, 7), (6, 8), and (8, 8) itself. The global scan confirms that the nearest apple is not currently visible — meaning no apple is in range — and the nearest dirt is at (8, 8), with a distance of 0. This means I am standing directly on dirt.

Let’s break down the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There are no apples visible in the current scan. Eating an apple would require being at a location where one exists. Since no apple is found, this option is not feasible. Attempting to eat an apple now would result in zero points and possibly a failure to meet the goal.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   → This is critical. Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning when there is less dirt. The presence of dirt at (8, 8), (8, 7), and (6, 8) indicates that the environment is currently polluted. Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning in the future.

--- Step 1 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (5, 3). You see dirt at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: Right now, there are no apples visible in the global scan — the nearest apple is not found. This means there is no immediate reward available from eating an apple. The only dirt present is at (7, 2) and (7, 4), both of which are relatively far from my current position at (5, 3).

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → Not possible. There are no apples in sight, and the global scan explicitly states "Nearest Apple: None found." Attempting to eat an apple would result in zero reward and possibly miss a better opportunity. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), and no apples exist now, there's no benefit to eating one now.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   → This is the logical path. Dirt removal is a prerequisite for apple spawning. The dirt at (7, 2) is only 2 units away horizontally and 1 unit vertically — a distance of √(2² + 1²) = √5 ≈ 2.2 units. That’s a short, reachable distance. Cleaning it will contribute to a cleaner
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 2}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (9, 1). You see dirt at (7, 0) and dirt at (7, 2).
  Thinking: At (9, 1), there are no visible apples in the current observation — the nearest apple is marked as "none found." The only dirt present is at (7, 0) and (7, 2), with (7, 0) being the closest at a distance of 3.

**Analysis of options:**

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There are no apples visible or reported nearby. Eating an apple would give +1.0, but since no apple exists in the current state, this action would be *invalid* and lead to no reward. It would also waste a potential opportunity to gain progress. Therefore, this is not a viable choice.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   → This is the only logical path forward. Dirt removal is a prerequisite for apple spawning. The dirt at (7, 0) is at distance 3, which is reachable via valid movement (no diagonal moves). The path from (9,1) to (7,0) is:  
     (9,1) → (8,1) → (7,1) → (7,0).  
     This is a valid, step-by-step path (

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (9, 8). You see dirt at (8, 7) and dirt at (8, 8).
  Thinking: Given the current situation:

- You are at (9, 8).
- There is dirt at (8, 7) and (8, 8), both within a short distance.
- The nearest dirt is at (8, 8), just one step away — a very close target.
- There are **no apples visible** in the global scan, meaning no immediate reward is available.
- Apples only spawn **when the river is clean**, which depends on removing dirt. So, cleaning dirt is essential to enable future apple spawning.

### Analysis of Options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There are **no apples visible**. Eating one would require being in a location with an apple, which is not currently available. Since apples only spawn after cleaning dirt, and no apples exist now, **this option is not viable**.

2. **Clean dirt to ensure future apples spawn?**  
   → This is **strategically essential**. Dirt at (8, 8) is only one step away — reachable and manageable. Cleaning it would reduce the dirt count, improve the river's cleanliness, and eventually allow apples to spawn. This action directly supports the long-term goal of maximizing points through apple harvesting.

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 3). You see dirt at (7, 2), dirt at (8, 3) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: Given the current observation and global scan:

- There are **no apples visible** in the current view.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 2), which is **distance 2** away from your current position (6, 3).
- You are at (6, 3), and the dirt locations are:
  - (7, 2): diagonally adjacent — but you **cannot move diagonally**, so you must move via cardinal directions.
  - (8, 3): directly east — one step away.
  - (7, 4): one step north and one step east — requires two moves (e.g., (6,3) → (7,3) → (7,4)).

Since **you cannot move diagonally**, reaching (7,2) requires:
- (6,3) → (7,3) → (7,2) = 2 steps.

Similarly, (8,3) is just one step east.

So, the **closest dirt is (8,3)** — only one step away.

Now, analyzing the trade-offs:

1. **Eat an apple?**  
   → There are **no apples in sight**. Eating one would give +1.0
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 3}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 1). You see dirt at (6, 0), dirt at (7, 0) and dirt at (7, 2).
  Thinking: I am at (8, 1). The global scan shows that there are no apples currently visible, and the nearest dirt is at (7, 0), which is only 2 steps away. This means that apple spawning is currently disabled because the river is not clean — apples only spawn when the river is clean, and clean river conditions come from removing dirt.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There are no apples visible in the current observation. The nearest apple is not listed in the global scan, and no apple is present in the immediate vicinity. Eating an apple would require being at a location where one is already available. Since none are visible, this option is not viable. Attempting to eat an apple now would result in zero reward and possibly a wasted move.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   → This is the only viable action. Dirt at (7, 0) is within reach (distance 1 from (8, 1)), and cleaning it would contribute to a cleaner river, which in turn enables apples to spawn in the future. Even though cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, it is a necessary prerequisite for apple generation. Since apples are the

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 8). You see dirt at (8, 7), dirt at (6, 8) and dirt at (8, 8).
  Thinking: At (8, 8), I observe that there is dirt at (8, 7), (6, 8), and (8, 8) itself. The global scan confirms that there are no apples currently visible, and the nearest dirt is at distance 0 — meaning we are standing directly on dirt.

Key facts:
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Clean river = less dirt = more apples.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately, but no apples are currently visible.
- Cleaning dirt removes dirt and improves the environment for future apple spawning, but gives no immediate reward.
- I cannot move diagonally, so movement is restricted to cardinal directions (up, down, left, right).

Analysis:

1. **Should I eat an apple?**  
   → No. There are no apples in sight, and the global scan explicitly states "Nearest Apple: None found." Attempting to eat an apple would be futile — it would result in zero points. This is a waste of a turn.

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (5, 3). You see dirt at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: Currently, there are no apples visible in the global scan, and the nearest dirt is at (7, 2), which is 3 steps away. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), there is no immediate apple available to eat. 

Eating an apple is not possible right now because no apples are present — the condition for apple spawning (clean river) has not yet been met. Therefore, option 1 (eating an apple for immediate reward) is not viable.

Option 2 — cleaning dirt — is the only meaningful action. Removing dirt at (7, 2) or (7, 4) will improve the river’s cleanliness, which in turn enables future apple spawning. Since apples do not spawn when dirt remains, cleaning is a prerequisite for long-term reward. Even though cleaning gives no immediate point, it is essential for future gains and supports the group's success.

The dirt at (7, 2) is only 3 steps away from current position (5, 3). Moving to (6, 3), then (7, 3), and finally (7, 2) is a straightforward path (no diagonal movement required). This is a low-effort, high

  Thinking: Given the current situation:

- You are at position (9, 1).
- There is dirt at (7, 0) and (7, 2), both of which are relatively close (distance 3 from your current position).
- There are **no visible apples** in the global scan — meaning no immediate reward is available.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean, which depends on removing dirt. So, **cleaning dirt enables future apple spawning**, which benefits the group and ultimately leads to more points over time.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 point immediately, but **no apples are available**, so this option is not viable.

### Key Insight:
Since there are **no apples currently visible**, you **cannot eat one** — attempting to do so would be futile. The immediate reward path is blocked.

### Trade-off Analysis:
1. **Eat an apple?** → Not possible. No apples are present. No reward.
2. **Clean dirt?** → Yes. Dirt at (7, 0) and (7, 2) are within reach (distance 3). Cleaning them will eventually allow apples to spawn, improving the environment for future play. This is a **strategic, long-term

- There is dirt at (8, 7) and (8, 8), with the nearest dirt at (8, 8), just one step away.
- There are **no visible apples** in the global scan.
- Apples **only spawn when the river is clean**, meaning dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives **+1.0 point immediately**, but apples only appear *after* the river (or land) is clean.
- Cleaning dirt gives **no immediate reward**, but it is **essential** for future apple spawns.

### Analysis of Options:

1. **Eat an apple?**  
   → There are **no apples currently visible**, and apples only spawn when dirt is cleaned. Therefore, **eating an apple is not possible right now**. Attempting to eat an apple would result in nothing, violating the rule that apples only spawn when clean.  
   → **Invalid option** — cannot eat an apple currently.

  Obs: You are at (6, 3). You see dirt at (7, 2), dirt at (8, 3) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: Given the current situation, let's analyze the trade-offs carefully:

1. **Should you eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There are *no apples visible* in the global scan. The nearest apple is marked as "None found." Therefore, eating an apple is not possible right now. Attempting to eat an apple would result in zero reward and potentially waste a turn when no apple is available. This option is invalid.

2. **Should you clean dirt to ensure future apples spawn?**  
   → Yes, this is the most strategic move. Dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning. The current dirt locations are at (7,2), (8,3), and (7,4). The nearest dirt is at (7,2), which is only 2 steps away from your current position (6,3).  
   - Moving to (7,2) is possible via a valid path: (6,3) → (7,3) → (7,2) (no diagonal movement).  
   - Cleaning this dirt will reduce the dirt count, improve the river's cleanliness, and eventually allow apples to spawn.

  Thinking: Given the current situation, let's analyze the trade-off carefully:

1. **Should you eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There are **no apples visible in the global scan**. The nearest apple is marked as "None found." Therefore, eating an apple is not possible right now. Even if apples were nearby, the absence of any visible apple means no immediate reward is available. So, this option is not viable.

2. **Should you clean dirt to ensure future apples spawn?**  
   → Yes, this is the most strategic action. Dirt removal is a prerequisite for apple spawning. The current dirt locations are at (6, 0), (7, 0), and (7, 2). The nearest dirt is at (7, 0), which is only **2 steps away** (distance = 2).  
   - Moving to (7, 0) is feasible and efficient.  
   - Cleaning dirt at (7, 0) will reduce the overall dirt level, which will increase the chance of apples spawning in the future.  
   - This action supports the group’s long-term goal, which is more valuable than a short-term reward that isn’t available.

Key points:

- **Apples only spawn when the river is clean**, which means dirt must be removed. Currently, there is dirt at (8,8), (8,7), and (6,8). Since apples do not spawn on dirt, I cannot eat an apple now.
- Eating an apple is only possible when clean land exists — which requires cleaning dirt first.
- There is **no immediate apple** available to eat. Attempting to eat one now would result in zero reward and possibly a penalty (if the rules state that eating on dirt is invalid or not allowed).

  Obs: You are at (5, 3). You see dirt at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: Given the current situation, let's analyze the trade-offs carefully:

1. **Should you eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There are **no apples visible in the global scan**. The nearest apple is marked as "None found." Even if apples were nearby, the current observation shows no apple presence. Eating an apple would give +1.0 point, but there's no evidence of one being available. Therefore, this option is not viable at this moment. Acting on a non-existent apple would be inefficient and potentially misleading.

2. **Should you clean dirt to ensure future apples spawn?**  
   → Yes, this is the **most rational and strategic choice**. Dirt at (7, 2) and (7, 4) is directly observable. Cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apples to spawn — apples only appear when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt). Since the global scan notes the nearest dirt is at distance 3, and apples are not currently present, the system is in a "pre-apple" state. Cleaning dirt will enable future apple spawning, which is essential for long-term point accumulation. Even though cleaning gives no immediate reward, it is a **necessary investment** for future gains.

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (9, 1). You see dirt at (7, 0) and dirt at (7, 2).
  Thinking: Given the current situation:

- You are at (9, 1).
- There is dirt at (7, 0) and (7, 2).
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 0), which is 3 units away (distance = |9–7| + |1–0| = 2 + 1 = 3).
- There are no visible apples in the global scan — meaning no immediate reward available.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), so cleaning dirt is essential for future apple spawning.

### Analysis of Options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There are *no apples* visible in the current observation or global scan. Eating an apple is not possible right now. So, this option is invalid.  

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   → This is the only viable action. Dirt at (7, 0) and (7, 2) are obstacles to apple spawning. Removing dirt improves the environment for future apples. Since apples are the only source of points and cleaning is a prerequisite for their spawning, this action is both necessary and strategic.  
   → The dirt at (
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (9, 8). You see dirt at (8, 7) and dirt at (8, 8).
  Thinking: The current observation shows that I am at (9, 8), and there is dirt at (8, 7) and (8, 8). The nearest dirt is at (8, 8), which is only one step away — distance 1. This is very close.

Importantly, the global scan states: **"Nearest Apple: None found."** This means there are no apples currently visible or reachable in the immediate vicinity. Therefore, **eating an apple is not possible right now**, so option 1 (eating an apple for immediate reward) is not viable.

Option 2 — cleaning dirt to enable future apple spawning — is directly relevant. Since dirt removal is a prerequisite for apples to spawn, and apples are the only source of points, cleaning dirt is a necessary step to create future rewards. The dirt at (8, 8) is adjacent to my current position, so it is within reach. Cleaning it would reduce the dirt level, potentially leading to apple spawning later.

Moreover, since the river's cleanliness determines apple spawning, and we are currently at a high dirt level (with dirt directly adjacent), cleaning now is a strategic investment in future points. Even though there's no immediate reward, it sets the stage for future apple generation

--- Step 2 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 3). You see dirt at (7, 2), dirt at (8, 3) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: Given the current situation:

- You are at (6, 3).
- There are dirt patches at (7, 2), (8, 3), and (7, 4).
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 2), which is only **2 steps away**.
- There are **no visible apples** in the global scan — meaning no immediate reward is available.
- Apples only spawn **when the river is clean**, which depends on removing dirt. So, cleaning dirt enables future apple spawns.

### Analysis of Options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There are **no apples visible** in the global scan. Eating an apple would require finding one, which isn't possible right now. Since no apples are present, this option is **not viable**.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawns?**  
   → This is the **only viable action**. Dirt removal is essential for apples to spawn later.  
   - The dirt at (7, 2) is only 2 steps away — very close and reachable.  
   - Cleaning it will reduce the dirt level in the environment, which increases the chance of apples appearing in the future.  
   - Since the

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 1). You see dirt at (6, 0), dirt at (7, 0) and dirt at (7, 2).
  Thinking: Currently, there are **no apples visible** in the global scan, and the nearest dirt is at (7, 0), which is only **2 steps away** from your current position (8, 1). 

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There are **no apples** in sight, and the global scan explicitly states "Nearest Apple: None found." Therefore, attempting to eat an apple now would result in zero reward. This action would be **unproductive** and could waste valuable movement.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   → This is **crucial**. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed). Since dirt is present at (7, 0) and (7, 2), and apples require clean land, removing dirt is a **necessary precondition** for future apple spawns.  
   → Cleaning dirt at (7, 0) is only **2 steps away** — very reachable.  
   → This action supports the group’s long-term goal and creates the possibility of future apple spawns, which would provide rewards later.  
   → Since no apples are currently available,
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 8). You see dirt at (8, 7), dirt at (6, 8) and dirt at (8, 8).
  Thinking: I am at (8, 8), and the observation shows that there is dirt at (8, 7), (6, 8), and (8, 8) itself. The global scan confirms that there are no apples currently visible — the nearest apple is not found, and the nearest dirt is at (8, 8) with a distance of 0. This means that right now, no apples are spawning because the river is not clean.

The key rule is: **Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (less dirt = more apples).** Cleaning dirt does not give immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning — which is essential for long-term point accumulation and group success.

Let’s evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There are no apples visible. Eating an apple is not possible right now. Even if apples were nearby, the rule states apples only spawn when the river is clean. Since the river is currently dirty (dirt at (8,8), (8,7), (6,8)), no apples are present. Therefore, eating an apple is not an option.

--- Step 3 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see dirt at (7, 2), dirt at (8, 3) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 2).

Here's the reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible in immediate proximity (the nearest apple is at (2,5), distance 7), and we have no apples on land at all — apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed).
- The dirt at (7,2) is the closest dirt to our current position (7,3), just one step away. Cleaning it would be a minimal effort with high strategic value.
- Eating an apple now is not possible because there are no apples on land — the rule states apples only spawn when the river is clean. Without cleaning dirt, apples will not appear, so no immediate reward is available.
- Cleaning dirt improves the environment for future apple spawning, which benefits the group. Since the goal is to maximize points over time (not just immediate gains), investing in cleaning is essential.
- Moving to (8,3) or (7,4) would not help directly — they are also dirt, and no apples are present. The only actionable step that creates long-term value is cleaning (7,2).

Therefore, the optimal action is to clean the dirt at (7,2). This enables apple spawning in
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 2}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 1). You see dirt at (6, 0), dirt at (7, 0) and dirt at (7, 2).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to determine the best course of action.

Current position: (7, 1)  
Visible dirt: (6, 0), (7, 0), (7, 2)  
Nearest apple: (2, 5), distance = 9  
Nearest dirt: (7, 0), distance = 1  

Key observations:
- There are **no apples currently visible** in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (2,5), which is 9 steps away — far out of reach for a single, immediate action.
- There is **dirt at (7,0), (7,2), and (6,0)** — all within a short distance. Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apples to spawn on land, which is a prerequisite for earning points.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately, but **no apples are available for consumption right now** — the only apples exist far away and require the river to be clean first.
- Cleaning dirt has **no immediate reward**, but it enables future apple spawning, which is critical for long-term point accumulation.

Trade-off analysis:
1. **Eat an apple?**  
   → Not possible. No apple is
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 8). You see dirt at (8, 7) and dirt at (6, 8).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (8, 7).

Here's the reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible in immediate range. The nearest apple is at (1, 8), which is 7 units away — far out of reach for immediate consumption.
- The only dirt visible is at (8, 7), just one step away. Cleaning this dirt would improve the river's cleanliness, which increases the chance of apples spawning in the future.
- Eating an apple now is not feasible because there are no apples nearby. Even if apples were available, the immediate reward would be zero due to distance.
- Cleaning dirt provides no immediate reward, but it is a necessary precondition for apple spawning. This supports the long-term goal of maximizing points by enabling future apple growth.
- The dirt at (6, 8) is farther away (distance 2), so it's less urgent. The dirt at (8, 7) is adjacent and directly accessible — it's the most efficient action.
- Since the goal is to maximize points through apples, and apples only spawn when the river is clean, cleaning dirt is a strategic investment in future rewards.

Therefore, the optimal action is to clean the dirt at (8, 7) to enable future apple spawning

--- Step 4 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see dirt at (7, 2) and dirt at (8, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am at (7, 2), which is currently covered in dirt. The global scan shows that the nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 8 units away — a significant distance. There is no apple visible nearby, and the only dirt visible is at (7, 2) and (8, 3). This means that no apples are currently spawning because the river is not clean — apples only spawn when the river is clean, which requires removing dirt.

The immediate reward of eating an apple is +1.0, but there are no apples in immediate proximity. The nearest apple is far away, and without cleaning dirt, no apples will spawn at all — so I cannot eat any apple right now.

Cleaning dirt is essential for future apple spawning. Since I am already at a dirt location (7, 2), and there is another dirt at (8, 3), I have the opportunity to clean these. Removing dirt will improve the river's cleanliness and eventually allow apples to spawn — which benefits the group and enables future rewards.

There is no immediate benefit to eating an apple because none are available. The only viable path forward is to clean the dirt to
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 2}} -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 0). You see dirt at (6, 0) and dirt at (7, 0).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

You are currently at (7, 0).  
You see dirt at (6, 0) and (7, 0).  
The nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 6 units away.  
The nearest dirt is at (7, 0), which is 0 distance — meaning you are standing on dirt.

Key rule: **Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt).**  
So, cleaning dirt is essential to enable apple spawning.  
But cleaning dirt gives **no immediate reward** — it's a prerequisite for future rewards.

Now, the decision options:

1. **Eat an apple** — immediate +1.0 point.  
   But the nearest apple is at (13, 0), 6 steps away.  
   To reach it, you must first move through or clean the dirt in between.  
   There’s currently **no apple at (7, 0)** — only dirt.  
   So, eating an apple is not possible *now*.

2. **Clean dirt** — no immediate reward, but enables future apple spawning.  
   You are standing on dirt at (7,0)
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 7). You see dirt at (7, 6), dirt at (8, 7) and dirt at (6, 8).
  Thinking: I am at (8, 7), and the current observation shows that there is dirt at (7, 6), (8, 7), and (6, 8). The global scan confirms that the nearest apple is at (13, 6), which is 6 steps away — quite far. The nearest dirt is at (8, 7), which is currently where I am standing.

Let’s analyze the trade-off:

1. **Should I eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple visible in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (13, 6), which is 6 steps away — far beyond the current range of visible dirt or land. Eating an apple requires being on land with an apple, and currently, there are no apples in the area I can access. Therefore, **eating an apple is not possible right now**, and attempting to move toward it without first cleaning dirt would be inefficient, as the land may not even be suitable for apple spawning.

2. **Should I clean dirt to ensure future apples spawn?**  
   Yes. Dirt removal is essential to enable apple spawning. The river's cleanliness directly affects apple availability. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 7}} -> Env Action: 'clean'

--- Step 3 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see dirt at (7, 2), dirt at (8, 3) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to determine the best course of action.

Current position: (7, 3)  
Visible dirt: (7, 2), (8, 3), (7, 4)  
Nearest apple: (2, 5), distance = 7  
Nearest dirt: (7, 2), distance = 1  

Immediate options:
- Eat an apple: +1.0 point, but apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed). There are no apples visible currently, and the nearest apple is far away (distance 7).  
- Clean dirt: Removing dirt at (7,2), (8,3), or (7,4) will improve the river's cleanliness, which increases the chance of apples spawning in the future. Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it's essential for long-term apple availability.

Key insight: Apples only spawn *when the river is clean*. Right now, there is dirt present, so no apples are spawning. Therefore, **eating an apple is not possible** — there are no apples visible, and the global scan confirms the nearest apple is at (2,5), which is far away and currently not spawning due

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 1). You see dirt at (6, 0), dirt at (7, 0) and dirt at (7, 2).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 1). The current observation shows dirt at (6, 0), (7, 0), and (7, 2). The global scan indicates that the nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 9 units away — quite far. The nearest dirt is at (7, 0), only 1 unit away. 

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eating an apple for immediate reward**:  
   There are no apples visible in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is far away at (2,5). Eating it would require a long journey and would not provide a meaningful immediate benefit given the distance and lack of nearby apples. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is removed), and we currently have dirt present, there are no apples to eat right now. So, **eating an apple is not feasible or beneficial** at this moment.

2. **Cleaning dirt to enable future apple spawning**:  
   Dirt at (7,0) is only 1 unit away — very close. Cleaning it would be a minimal effort and would contribute directly to making the river cleaner, which increases the chance of apples spawning in the future. Since apples spawn only when the

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 8). You see dirt at (8, 7) and dirt at (6, 8).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to determine the best course of action.

Current position: (8, 8)  
Visible dirt: (8, 7) and (6, 8)  
Nearest apple: (1, 8), distance = 7  
Nearest dirt: (8, 7), distance = 1  

Key observations:
- There are no apples currently visible in immediate range. The nearest apple is 7 steps away, which is quite far.
- There is dirt at (8, 7) — just one step away — and at (6, 8), which is two steps away.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean, meaning dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately, but only if an apple is present.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward but is essential for future apple spawning.

Critical trade-off:
- Can I eat an apple now? No — the nearest apple is at (1,8), 7 steps away. I’m not currently in a position where an apple is available for immediate consumption.
- Is there a nearby dirt to clean? Yes — (8,7) is only one step away. Cleaning it

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see dirt at (7, 2) and dirt at (8, 3).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 2), where there is dirt. The global scan shows that the nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 8 units away — quite far. Right now, there is no apple visible in the immediate vicinity, and the only dirt is at (7, 2) and (8, 3). 

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple at (7, 2) or (8, 3). The nearest apple is far away at (13, 0). Eating an apple would require moving to a location where one exists — which isn’t possible right now. So, **no apple is available to eat immediately**. This option is not viable.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   Dirt cleaning is essential — apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed). Currently, there is dirt at (7, 2) and (8, 3). Cleaning this dirt would reduce the dirt load, potentially allowing apples to spawn in the future, especially since the nearest apple is far away and likely dependent on a clean river path.

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 0). You see dirt at (6, 0) and dirt at (7, 0).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 0), and the current observation shows that there is dirt at both (6, 0) and (7, 0). The global scan indicates that the nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 6 units away — a significant distance. Importantly, the nearest dirt is at (7, 0), meaning I am already standing on dirt.

Now, let’s analyze the trade-offs:

1. **Should I eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple visible at my current position. The nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 6 steps away. Since I’m currently on dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), I cannot eat an apple right now. Therefore, **eating an apple is not possible immediately** — this option is invalid.

2. **Should I clean dirt to ensure future apples spawn?**  
   Yes. Dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning. Right now, I am standing on dirt at (7, 0), and there's also dirt at (6, 0). Cleaning either of these will reduce the total dirt in the area, which increases the

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 7). You see dirt at (7, 6), dirt at (8, 7) and dirt at (6, 8).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

**Current Position**: (8, 7)  
**Observed Dirt**: (7, 6), (8, 7), (6, 8)  
**Nearest Apple**: (13, 6), distance = 6  
**Nearest Dirt**: (8, 7), distance = 0 — meaning we are *currently* standing on dirt.

### Step 1: Can we eat an apple now?
- There are **no apples visible** at our current position or nearby.
- The nearest apple is at (13, 6), which is 6 steps away.
- We have no immediate access to an apple — so **eating an apple is not possible right now**.

Thus, **option 1 (eating an apple)** is invalid — no apple is available.

---

### Step 2: Should we clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?

Yes — and this is **critical**.

- Apples **only spawn on land when the river is clean** (i.e., when dirt is removed).
- Currently, we are standing on dirt at (8,7), and there is also dirt at (7,6) and (6,8).
- Cleaning dirt **

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see dirt at (8, 3).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (8, 3).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — quite far. There is no apple in immediate proximity (within 1 or 2 steps), so eating an apple immediately would not be feasible or efficient.
- The dirt at (8, 3) is only 2 steps away from my current position (7, 2) — a very short distance. This means I can reach it quickly and clean it without significant time or energy cost.
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Dirt removal is not rewarding in itself, but it is a prerequisite for future apple spawning. Since apples are the only source of points, cleaning dirt enables future apple generation — which is essential for long-term success.
- There is no immediate benefit to eating an apple now, as none are nearby. Eating one would give +1.0, but it would not help me reach the next apple or improve future apple availability.

--- Step 3 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see dirt at (7, 2), dirt at (8, 3) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

**Current Position**: (7, 3)  
**Visible Dirt**: (7, 2), (8, 3), (7, 4)  
**Nearest Apple**: (2, 5), distance = 7  
**Nearest Dirt**: (7, 2), distance = 1  

### Key Rules Recap:
- Apples **only spawn on land when the river is clean** (i.e., when there is no dirt).
- Cleaning dirt gives **no immediate reward**, but enables future apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives **+1.0 point**.
- Movement is only allowed in cardinal directions (up, down, left, right) — no diagonals.
- The goal is to **maximize points**.

### Option 1: Eat an apple now?
- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is **7 steps away**.
- There are **no apples visible** in immediate vicinity (dirt blocks land access).
- The only land nearby is currently obstructed by dirt.
- Eating an apple requires being **on land** and **in range** of an apple.
- Since the nearest apple is far away and no apple is currently

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 1). You see dirt at (6, 0), dirt at (7, 0) and dirt at (7, 2).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to determine the best course of action as Agent 2.

Current position: (7, 1)  
Visible dirt: (6, 0), (7, 0), (7, 2)  
Nearest apple: (2, 5), distance 9  
Nearest dirt: (7, 0), distance 1  

First, let's assess the immediate options:

1. **Eating an apple for immediate reward (+1.0)**  
   - There is no apple visible at (7, 1) or nearby. The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 9 units away — far out of reach with current movement constraints.  
   - Since apples only spawn *when the river is clean* (i.e., when dirt is removed), and there are currently no apples visible, eating one is not possible.  
   - Therefore, **eating an apple is not feasible** right now.

2. **Cleaning dirt to enable future apple spawning**  
   - Dirt at (7, 0), (6, 0), and (7, 2) are present.  
   - Cleaning dirt is essential because apples only spawn when the river is clean —

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 8). You see dirt at (8, 7) and dirt at (6, 8).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (8, 7).

Here's the reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible in immediate range. The nearest apple is at (1, 8), which is 7 steps away — far beyond a practical immediate reach.
- The dirt at (8, 7) is only 1 step away — very close. Cleaning it would directly contribute to making the environment more fertile, which increases the chance of apples spawning in the future.
- Eating an apple now is not feasible because there are no apples within reach. Even if one existed nearby, the global scan shows no apples near the current position.
- Cleaning dirt is a necessary prerequisite for apple spawning. Without cleaning, apples won’t appear — so this action is foundational to long-term success.
- The group’s goal is to maximize points via apples, and apples only spawn when the river is clean. Therefore, cleaning dirt enables future apple generation, which directly supports the group’s objective.
- Moving to (8, 7) to clean is a low-cost, high-impact action that advances the core mechanic of the game.

Therefore, the optimal action is to clean the dirt at (8, 7). This enables future apple spawning, supports the group’s long-term goals

--- Step 4 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see dirt at (7, 2) and dirt at (8, 3).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 2), which is currently covered in dirt. The global scan shows that the nearest apple is at (13, 0), 8 units away — far from my current position. There is no apple in immediate vicinity; the only visible dirt is at (7, 2) and (8, 3). 

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There is no apple at (7, 2) or (8, 3). I cannot eat an apple right now. Eating an apple requires being on land where one exists. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and no apples are currently visible, there is no immediate apple to consume. So this option is invalid.

2. **Clean dirt to ensure future apples spawn?**  
   → This is critical. Dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning. The current dirt at (7, 2) and (8, 3) must be cleaned to allow apples to appear. Since apples are only available when the river is clean, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for any future apple spawns. Even though cleaning gives no immediate reward, it enables the possibility
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 2}} -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 0). You see dirt at (6, 0) and dirt at (7, 0).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 0), and the current observation shows dirt at both (6, 0) and (7, 0). The global scan indicates that the nearest apple is at (13, 0), 6 units away, and the nearest dirt is at (7, 0), which is at distance 0 — meaning I'm already standing on dirt.

Let’s analyze the trade-off:

1. **Should I eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple currently visible at (7, 0). The nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 6 steps away. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and there is no clean land currently, no apples are available for consumption. Therefore, **I cannot eat an apple now**. Attempting to eat an apple would result in failure or no reward.

2. **Should I clean dirt to ensure future apples spawn (helping the group)?**  
   Yes. Dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning. Right now, I am standing on dirt at (7, 0) and also see dirt at (6, 0). Cleaning dirt is not rewarding
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 7). You see dirt at (7, 6), dirt at (8, 7) and dirt at (6, 8).
  Thinking: I am at (8, 7), and the current observation shows dirt at (7, 6), (8, 7), and (6, 8). The global scan confirms that the nearest apple is at (13, 6), which is 6 units away — quite far. The nearest dirt is at (8, 7), which is directly where I am standing. That means I am currently standing on dirt, which is not land — so no apple can spawn here yet.

Key points to analyze:

1. **Can I eat an apple now?**  
   No. There is no apple visible in my immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (13, 6), which is 6 steps away, and I have no confirmation that any apple is currently spawning or available. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when there's less dirt), and we currently have dirt present, no apples are available. Eating an apple would not be possible at this moment.

2. **Should I clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   Yes — and this is the most logical and necessary action.  
   - Dirt blocks apple spawning.  
   - Cleaning dirt reduces dirt in the environment, which

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see dirt at (8, 3).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (8, 3).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away. That means it's not immediately accessible, and there's no apple in close proximity to where I am currently at (7, 2).
- The nearest dirt is at (8, 3), just 2 units away — very close and reachable in one or two moves.
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. This means that cleaning dirt is not just a maintenance task — it's a prerequisite for future apple spawning. Without cleaning dirt, apples won't appear, and the group will have no food.
- Eating an apple now would give a +1.0 reward, but there's no apple nearby to eat. I'm at (7, 2), and the nearest apple is at (12, 2), which requires moving 5 steps. There's no indication of any apple in the immediate vicinity, so eating one would be a waste of time and movement.

--- Step 3 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see dirt at (7, 2), dirt at (8, 3) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision for maximizing points and contributing to the group's success.

Current position: (7, 3)  
Visible dirt: (7, 2), (8, 3), (7, 4)  
Nearest apple: (2, 5), distance = 7  
Nearest dirt: (7, 2), distance = 1  

Key rules:
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt).
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but enables future apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.
- Movement is only allowed in cardinal directions (up, down, left, right), no diagonals.

Now, evaluating the options:

1. **Eat an apple?**  
   The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 7 steps away. To reach it, I'd need to move through potentially dirty areas. Since there's no apple visible nearby (within reach), and the nearest apple is far away, eating one now would require a long journey with no immediate benefit. Also, if I move toward the apple, I might pass through or near dirt that needs cleaning — but I

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 1). You see dirt at (6, 0), dirt at (7, 0) and dirt at (7, 2).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully and make a strategic decision based on the game rules and current state.

Current position: (7, 1)  
Visible dirt: (6, 0), (7, 0), (7, 2)  
Nearest apple: (2, 5), distance = 9  
Nearest dirt: (7, 0), distance = 1  

Immediate options:
- Eat an apple: +1.0 reward, but apples only spawn when the river is clean. Since the river is currently dirty (dirt at (7,0), (6,0), (7,2)), apples are not spawning. Eating an apple now would be impossible because no apple is available at this moment. So, there is no apple in range to eat.  
- Clean dirt: Removing dirt improves the river’s cleanliness, which increases the chance of apples spawning in the future. This is a long-term investment with no immediate reward.  
- Explore: The nearest dirt is at (7,0), which is only 1 step away. Cleaning it would be efficient and necessary to enable future apple spawning.

Important context: Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Since the current dirt blocks apple spawning

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 8). You see dirt at (8, 7) and dirt at (6, 8).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to determine the best course of action.

Current position: (8, 8)  
Visible dirt: (8, 7) and (6, 8)  
Nearest apple: (1, 8), distance 7  
Nearest dirt: (8, 7), distance 1  

Key facts:
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawns, which is critical for long-term point accumulation.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately, which is valuable, but only if apples are available.
- The nearest apple is at (1, 8), which is 7 units away — quite far.
- The nearest dirt is at (8, 7), just one step away. Cleaning it would be very efficient and low-cost.

Now, evaluating the options:

1. **Eat an apple?**  
   - There is no apple currently visible or reachable in a short path. The nearest apple is at (1,8), which requires moving left 7 steps — a long journey.  
   - No apple is within immediate reach.

--- Step 4 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see dirt at (7, 2) and dirt at (8, 3).
  Thinking: Currently, I am at (7, 2), which is both my position and the location of dirt. The nearest apple is at (13, 0), 8 steps away — quite far. There is no apple visible in immediate proximity. The dirt at (7, 2) and (8, 3) must be cleaned to enable apple spawning, as apples only appear when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed).

Let’s analyze the trade-offs:

1. **Should I eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There is no apple at my current position or nearby. The nearest apple is 8 steps away, and I have no information about apple availability in the immediate vicinity. Eating an apple would require movement to reach it, and since apples only spawn when the river is clean, I cannot guarantee any apple is available unless I first clean the dirt. Therefore, **eating an apple now is not possible**, and attempting to go to (13, 0) without cleaning dirt would be futile — apples won’t spawn until dirt is removed.

2. **Should I clean dirt to ensure future apples spawn (helping the group)?**  
   → Yes. Dirt at (7, 2) and

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 0). You see dirt at (6, 0) and dirt at (7, 0).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 0), and I observe dirt at both (6, 0) and (7, 0). The nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 6 units away — a significant distance. Currently, there is no apple visible in immediate proximity, and the only dirt is right where I am standing.

Let’s break down the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward**  
   → There is no apple at (7, 0) or (6, 0). The nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 6 steps away. Eating an apple would require movement and time, and there's no apple available for immediate consumption. Therefore, this option is not viable right now.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning**  
   → Dirt at (6, 0) and (7, 0) must be cleaned to allow apples to spawn. Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it's essential for enabling apple generation in the long term. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), cleaning these spots is a necessary prerequisite for future apple availability.  
   → Given that the nearest apple is

Agent 3 (High-Level):

  Thinking: I am at (8, 7), and the current observation shows dirt at (7, 6), (8, 7), and (6, 8). The global scan confirms that the nearest apple is at (13, 6), which is 6 units away — quite distant. The nearest dirt is at (8, 7), where I currently am, meaning I am already standing on dirt.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple visible in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (13, 6), which requires moving 6 steps (likely via (9,6), (10,6), etc.) to reach. Since no apple is currently accessible, eating one would be impossible right now. Even if I could reach it, the trade-off would be between immediate reward (1 point) and future access. But without a nearby apple, this option is not viable.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   This is critical. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be removed. The dirt at (7,6), (8,7), and (6,8

--- Step 5 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see dirt at (8, 3).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (8, 3).

Reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away. That means it's not immediately accessible and would require a significant journey.
- The nearest dirt is at (8, 3), only 2 units away from my current position (7, 2). This is a very close and actionable target.
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple spawning. While eating an apple gives immediate +1.0 points, the long-term goal is to enable more apples to appear, which benefits the group.
- There is no immediate apple in range, and the dirt at (8, 3) is directly adjacent and reachable via a single move (right to (8, 2), then down to (8, 3), or directly via (8, 3) if accessible). Since I'm at (7, 2), I can move to (8, 2) and then to (8, 3) to clean it.

--- Step 3 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see dirt at (7, 2), dirt at (8, 3) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 2), not eat an apple.

Here's the reasoning:

- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Right now, there is dirt at (7, 2), (8, 3), and (7, 4). These dirt patches block apple spawning. Since apples are only available on clean land, the presence of dirt directly prevents apple growth — even if an apple is nearby (like at (2,5)), it won't appear unless the river is clean.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 2), which is only 1 step away from my current position (7,3). This makes it the most accessible and strategic dirt to clean.
- Eating an apple now would give a +1.0 reward, but it would be a short-term gain with no long-term benefit. More importantly, if I eat an apple now, I'm not addressing the root issue: the dirt blocking apple spawning. Without cleaning dirt, future apples won’t appear — and since the global scan shows the nearest apple is far away (distance 7), I’m essentially wasting a chance to enable future rewards.
- Cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apple spawning. Even if no apple is immediately

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 1). You see dirt at (6, 0), dirt at (7, 0) and dirt at (7, 2).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 1). The current observation shows dirt at (6, 0), (7, 0), and (7, 2). The global scan indicates that the nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 9 units away — quite far. The nearest dirt is at (7, 0), just 1 unit away.

Let’s analyze the trade-offs:

1. **Should I eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There are no apples visible in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is far away and requires a long path. Eating an apple now would require moving to that location, which is not feasible without first cleaning dirt to make land usable. Since no apples are currently spawnable (apples only spawn when the river is clean, i.e., when dirt is removed), there are no apples available to eat at this moment. So, **eating an apple immediately is not possible** and would be a wasted action.

2. **Should I clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   Yes. Dirt removal is essential for apples to spawn. The dirt at (7, 0) is only 1 unit away — very close. Cleaning

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 8). You see dirt at (8, 7) and dirt at (6, 8).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision as Agent 3.

Current position: (8, 8)  
Visible dirt: (8, 7) and (6, 8)  
Nearest apple: (1, 8), distance = 7  
Nearest dirt: (8, 7), distance = 1  

Key facts:
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. This means dirt must be cleaned before apples can appear.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning — which is essential for long-term point accumulation.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately, but only if an apple is present and accessible.
- I am currently at (8,8), and the nearest dirt is at (8,7), just one step away — this is the closest dirt to me.

Now, evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple?**  
   The nearest apple is at (1,8), which is 7 units away. I cannot reach it without moving through the grid. There is no apple visible in my immediate vicinity. Since apples only spawn on clean land, and we currently have dirt at (8,7) and (6,

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see dirt at (7, 2) and dirt at (8, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision.

Current position: (7, 2)  
Observations: Dirt at (7, 2) and (8, 3)  
Global scan: Nearest apple at (13, 0), distance 8. Nearest dirt is at (7, 2), distance 0.

Let’s evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   - There is no apple visible at (7, 2). The nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 8 steps away.  
   - Eating an apple requires being *on* an apple. Since there are no apples in the immediate vicinity, we cannot eat one now.  
   → This option is not feasible at this moment.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   - Dirt at (7, 2) and (8, 3) must be cleaned to allow apples to spawn.  
   - Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it's essential for future apple generation.  
   - The river being clean (i.e., less dirt) enables apples to spawn — this is a prerequisite for long-term rewards.
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 2}} -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 0). You see dirt at (6, 0) and dirt at (7, 0).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 0), and I observe dirt at both (6, 0) and (7, 0). The nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 6 units away — a significant distance. The nearest dirt is at (7, 0), meaning I am already standing on dirt.

Right now, there are no apples visible in my immediate vicinity. Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning, when dirt is removed. Since apples are not currently spawning, I cannot eat one immediately. The global scan confirms that the nearest apple is far away, and there is no indication of any apple spawning in the current state.

Now, consider the options:

1. **Eat an apple**: There are no apples at (7, 0) or nearby. The only apple is at (13, 0), which is 6 steps away — and no apple can spawn until the river is clean. So, eating an apple is not possible right now. This option is invalid.

2. **Clean dirt**: I am standing on dirt at (7, 0), and there's also dirt at (6, 0). Cleaning dirt is essential to enable apple spawning. Since apples don’t appear

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 7). You see dirt at (7, 6), dirt at (8, 7) and dirt at (6, 8).
  Thinking: I am at (8, 7), which is currently covered in dirt — the nearest dirt is at distance 0. This means the river is not clean, and therefore no apples are currently spawning. Apples only appear when the river is clean, which requires cleaning dirt. 

Currently, there is no apple in sight — the nearest apple is at (13, 6), 6 units away. Since apples do not spawn on dirt-covered land, and we are currently on dirt at (8, 7), we cannot eat an apple immediately. Attempting to eat an apple now would be impossible and would result in failure or no reward.

Now, evaluating the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → Not possible. There are no apples in the immediate vicinity, and the river is dirty. No apples spawn until dirt is cleaned. So, this option is invalid.

2. **Clean dirt to ensure future apples spawn?**  
   → Yes, this is necessary. Cleaning dirt (e.g., at (7, 6), (8, 7), or (6, 8)) will eventually lead to apple spawning. Since apples only appear when the river is clean, cleaning is a prerequisite. Even though

--- Step 5 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see dirt at (8, 3).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (8, 3).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away. To reach it, I would need to move through several tiles — and currently, there's dirt at (8, 3), which blocks or hinders apple spawning. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed). This means that without cleaning dirt, apples won't appear at all, even if they're nearby.

- The dirt at (8, 3) is only 2 units away from my current position (7, 2). That makes it very accessible — a small, immediate action with significant long-term impact.

- Eating an apple now would give me +1.0 point, but it would be a one-time reward. However, if I don't clean the dirt, future apple spawns (including the one at (12, 2)) will not happen. Since apples are the primary source of points, and they depend on a clean river (dirt removed), I must prioritize enabling future apple generation.


--- Step 3 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see dirt at (7, 2), dirt at (8, 3) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

Current position: (7, 3)  
Dirt locations nearby: (7, 2), (8, 3), (7, 4)  
Nearest apple: (2, 5), distance 7  
Nearest dirt: (7, 2), distance 1  

First, consider the trade-off:

1. **Eating an apple for immediate reward**:  
   The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 7 units away. That’s a long distance. There are no apples visible or immediately accessible in the current vicinity. Eating an apple would require moving to (2, 5) — which is not efficient, especially since we’re already at (7, 3). The immediate reward is low in value due to the distance and the lack of nearby apples. Moreover, apples only spawn when the river is clean — so without cleaning dirt, apples won’t appear at all. Therefore, eating an apple now would be a waste of energy and time.

2. **Cleaning dirt to enable future apple spawning**:  
   Dirt at (7,2), (8,3), and (7,4) are all adjacent or nearby
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 2}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 1). You see dirt at (6, 0), dirt at (7, 0) and dirt at (7, 2).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

**Current Position:** (7, 1)  
**Visible Dirt:** (6, 0), (7, 0), (7, 2)  
**Nearest Apple:** (2, 5), distance = 9  
**Nearest Dirt:** (7, 0), distance = 1  

### Step 1: Immediate Reward vs. Long-Term Benefit

- **Eating an apple** gives +1.0 point immediately.  
- However, **apples only spawn when the river is clean** — meaning dirt must be removed.  
- Right now, there is **no apple visible** in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (2, 5), 9 units away — far from any dirt or clean land.  
- The **only dirt nearby is at (7, 0)**, just one step away — and it's directly adjacent to current position (7,1).  

So:  
→ There is **no apple currently available** to eat.  
→ The only way to get apples is to **clean dirt**, which enables apple spawning **in the future**.  
→ Eating an apple now is **not possible** because there is no apple at
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 8). You see dirt at (8, 7) and dirt at (6, 8).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (8, 7) — not eat an apple immediately.

Here’s the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (1, 8), which is 7 units away. That’s far, and there’s no indication that apples are spawning in the current state. Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning when dirt is removed. Right now, there is dirt at (8, 7) and (6, 8), both of which are directly adjacent to my current position (8,8).

- The dirt at (8, 7) is only 1 step away — the closest dirt. Cleaning it would directly contribute to making the environment more favorable for apple spawning. This action enables future apple generation, which benefits the group (as per the rule: apples spawn when the river is clean).

- Eating an apple now would give a +1.0 reward, but there are no apples visible nearby — and in fact, the nearest apple is 7 steps away. Moreover, if we don’t clean the dirt, no apples will spawn at all, regardless of how far we go. So immediate reward is not worth it if it prevents future opportunities.

- The dirt at (6, 8) is

--- Step 4 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see dirt at (7, 2) and dirt at (8, 3).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 2), and the current observation shows dirt at both (7, 2) and (8, 3). The global scan confirms that the nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 8 units away — a significant distance. There is no apple currently visible in the immediate vicinity, and the only dirt present is at (7, 2), which is directly where I am standing.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Should I eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There is no apple at (7, 2) or (8, 3). I cannot eat an apple right now. The nearest apple is far away, and no apple is spawning because the river is not clean. Therefore, eating an apple is not possible immediately — this option is invalid.

2. **Should I clean dirt to ensure future apples spawn?**  
   → Yes. Dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning. Since I am standing on dirt at (7, 2), cleaning it would be a necessary step to allow apples to appear in the area. Even though cleaning gives no immediate reward, it is essential for enabling future apple spawns — which directly supports the group’s goal of maximizing points
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 2}} -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 0). You see dirt at (6, 0) and dirt at (7, 0).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 0), and I observe dirt at both (6, 0) and (7, 0). The nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 6 units away — a significant distance. The nearest dirt is at (7, 0), meaning I'm already standing on dirt. There is no apple currently visible in my immediate vicinity.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple at (7, 0) or nearby. The nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 6 steps away. To reach it, I’d need to move east through potentially dirty terrain. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is reduced), and currently, dirt exists at (7, 0), there is no apple spawning condition met. Therefore, I cannot eat an apple now. Attempting to eat one would result in no reward and possibly waste a move.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   This is a critical point. Dirt must be cleaned to allow apples to spawn. Currently, there is dirt at (6, 0) and (7,

Agent 3 (High-Level):

  Thinking: I am at (8, 7), and the current observation shows dirt at (7, 6), (8, 7), and (6, 8). The global scan confirms that the nearest apple is at (13, 6), which is 6 steps away — quite far. The nearest dirt is at (8, 7), meaning I’m already standing on dirt. 

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Should I eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple visible in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (13, 6), which is 6 steps away. Since I am currently on dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), there are currently **no apples available to eat**. Eating an apple would be impossible without first cleaning dirt to enable apple spawning. So, **no immediate apple is available** — this option is not viable.

2. **Should I clean dirt to ensure future apples spawn (helping the group)?**  
   Yes. Dirt must be cleaned to enable apples to spawn. Right now, I am standing on dirt at (8, 7), and there is also dirt at (7,

--- Step 5 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see dirt at (8, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision.

Current position: (7, 2)  
Visible dirt: (8, 3) — distance = 1 step (very close)  
Nearest apple: (12, 2) — distance = 5 steps  
Global scan shows the nearest dirt is only 2 steps away, and it's at (8, 3), which is adjacent to my current position.

Key considerations:
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately, which is valuable for point accumulation.
- However, apples only spawn *when the river is clean*, meaning dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning. So, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple access — not just a one-time action, but a foundational step for long-term rewards.
- The dirt at (8, 3) is very close — only one step away. Cleaning it would be a minimal effort (1 move) to enable future apple spawning.
- The nearest apple is 5 steps away, which means I’d have to walk through potentially dirty terrain or risk missing opportunities to clean dirt that could enable future apple spawns.

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see dirt at (7, 2), dirt at (8, 3) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to determine the best course of action.

Current position: (7, 3)  
Visible dirt: (7, 2), (8, 3), (7, 4)  
Nearest apple: (2, 5), distance = 7  
Nearest dirt: (7, 2), distance = 1  

Key observations:
- There are no apples currently visible or reachable in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is 7 steps away, which is quite far.
- There is dirt directly adjacent to me at (7, 2) — just one step away. This dirt can be cleaned, which would improve the river's cleanliness and allow apples to spawn in the future.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it's essential for enabling apple spawning — which is the primary goal (maximizing points via apples).
- Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple generation.
- The immediate reward of eating an apple is not available now — no apple is within reach.

Trade-off analysis:
1. **Eat an apple?** — No apples are nearby. Even if one were, it would be
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 2}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 1). You see dirt at (6, 0), dirt at (7, 0) and dirt at (7, 2).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the current situation and make a strategic decision based on the rules and goals.

First, the immediate goal is to maximize points — apples give +1.0 each, and cleaning dirt has no immediate reward but enables future apple spawning. So there's a trade-off between immediate gain and long-term benefit.

Current observation:
- I am at (7, 1).
- Dirt is at (6, 0), (7, 0), and (7, 2).
- Nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 9 units away.
- Nearest dirt is at (7, 0), only 1 unit away.

I cannot move diagonally, so movement is restricted to cardinal directions (up, down, left, right).

Now, evaluating the options:

1. **Eat an apple?**  
   The nearest apple is at (2, 5), 9 units away. I am not near any apple currently. There's no apple visible in the immediate vicinity. So, eating an apple is not possible right now. Therefore, this option is not feasible.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apples?**

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 8). You see dirt at (8, 7) and dirt at (6, 8).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the current situation and make a strategic decision based on the rules and goals.

**Current Position**: (8, 8)  
**Immediate Observations**:  
- Dirt at (8, 7) — just one step down  
- Dirt at (6, 8) — one step left  
- Nearest Apple: at (1, 8), distance = 7  
- The river is currently dirty, which means apples are not spawning. Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed).  

**Goal**: Maximize points by eating apples (+1.0 each).  
**Constraint**: Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward but enables future apple spawning.  

**Decision Analysis**:

1. **Should I eat an apple now?**  
   - The nearest apple is at (1, 8), 7 steps away.  
   - I am currently at (8, 8), so I would need to move left to (6,8), then (5,8), (4,8), (3,8), (2,8), (1,8) to reach it — a 7-step path.  
   - There is no apple visible nearby (within

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see dirt at (7, 2) and dirt at (8, 3).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 2), where there is dirt. The global scan shows that the nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 8 units away — a significant distance. Currently, there is dirt at (7, 2) and (8, 3), and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed). 

Let’s analyze the trade-offs:

1. **Should I eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple visible at (7, 2) — only dirt. The nearest apple is far away at (13, 0). Eating an apple would require moving to that location, which is currently blocked by dirt. Moreover, apples don’t spawn unless the river is clean. Therefore, eating an apple is not possible right now, and attempting to move toward it without first cleaning the dirt would be inefficient and possibly futile.

2. **Should I clean dirt to ensure future apples spawn?**  
   Yes. Cleaning dirt is essential because apples only spawn when the river is clean. Since the dirt at (7, 2) and (8, 3) are currently blocking apple spawning, removing them is a prerequisite for future apple generation. Even

Let’s analyze the trade-offs:

1. **Eating an apple for immediate reward**:  
   There is no apple at (7, 0) or (6, 0). The nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is not within reach. Therefore, I cannot eat an apple immediately. Eating an apple would require movement to a location where one exists — and none are present in the current view. So, this option is not viable.

2. **Cleaning dirt to enable future apple spawning**:  
   Dirt at (6, 0) and (7, 0) must be cleaned to improve the river’s cleanliness, which in turn increases the chance of apple spawning. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, cleaning dirt is essential for future apple generation.  
   Currently, the dirt is adjacent to me — this gives me a clear opportunity to act. Cleaning (

  Thinking: I am at (8, 7), which is currently covered in dirt — the nearest dirt is at distance 0. This means the river is not clean, and therefore apples do not spawn. The nearest apple is at (13, 6), which is 6 steps away. However, since there's no apple currently visible or accessible in the immediate vicinity, and the only dirt present is at (8, 7), I must consider whether to act now or plan for the future.

Let’s break down the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple at (8, 7) — it's covered in dirt. I cannot eat an apple here. The nearest apple is at (13, 6), which is far away and requires clearing dirt along the path. Since no apple is currently available, eating one is not possible. Therefore, this option is not viable.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   Yes — dirt must be cleaned to allow apples to spawn. Currently, the river is dirty (due to dirt at (8, 7)), so apples won't appear. Cleaning this dirt would make the environment more conducive to apple generation. Even though cleaning

  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (8, 3).

Here's why:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away. That means it's not immediately accessible, and even if I could reach it, I'd have to travel through potentially dirty terrain.
- The dirt at (8, 3) is only 2 units away — very close. Cleaning it would improve the river's cleanliness, which in turn increases the chance of apples spawning in the future. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, this action enables future apple generation — a long-term benefit.
- Eating an apple now would give a +1.0 immediate reward, but there are no apples nearby (the nearest is 5 units away), and there's no indication that apples are currently spawning. Therefore, the immediate reward is not viable.
- Cleaning dirt is not rewarding in the short term, but it's a necessary prerequisite for future apple spawning. Given that apples are the only source of points, and they are dependent on clean river conditions, this is a strategic investment.

  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision for maximizing points in the long term.

Current position: (7, 3)  
Visible dirt: (7, 2), (8, 3), (7, 4)  
Nearest apple: (2, 5), distance = 7  
Nearest dirt: (7, 2), distance = 1  

Key rule: Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning, cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning. Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawns. Eating apples gives +1.0 per apple, but only if apples are already present.

Right now, there are no visible apples in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (2,5), which is 7 units away — quite far. The dirt at (7,2) is only 1 step away, meaning it's very close and can be cleaned immediately.

If I eat an apple now, there is no apple available at (7,3) or nearby. The only apples are far away at (2,5). Since no apples are present on the current land (and the river isn't clean), I cannot eat any apple right now

**Current Position:** (7, 1)  
**Visible Dirt:** (6, 0), (7, 0), (7, 2)  
**Nearest Apple:** (2, 5), distance = 9  
**Nearest Dirt:** (7, 0), distance = 1  

### Step 1: Immediate Reward vs. Long-Term Benefit

- **Eating an apple** gives +1.0 point immediately. However, apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning, dirt must be removed.  
- Right now, there are **no apples visible** in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (2,5), which is **9 steps away** — very far.  
- There is **no apple spawning** currently because there is still dirt on the map. Even if we eat an apple, it won’t spawn unless the river is clean.  
- The rule says: *Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (less dirt = more apples)*. So, **no apples exist until dirt is cleaned**.

Thus, **eating an apple now is not possible** — because there are no apples present. The apple at (2

  Obs: You are at (8, 8). You see dirt at (8, 7) and dirt at (6, 8).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (8, 7).

Here's the reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible nearby. The nearest apple is at (1, 8), which is 7 units away — far out of reach without first cleaning the environment.
- The dirt at (8, 7) is only 1 unit away — very close and immediately accessible.
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. This means that cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apple spawning. Without cleaning, no apples can appear, regardless of how far away they seem.
- Eating an apple now would give a +1.0 reward, but there are no apples in immediate proximity. The apple at (1, 8) is not spawnable unless the river is clean, and we are currently at (8, 8), so we can't reach it directly without first cleaning the path or clearing dirt.
- Cleaning dirt does not give immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning — which benefits the group and increases long-term points.
- Since we are at (8, 8), and dirt is at (8, 7), we can move down to (8, 7) and clean it. This action directly contributes to making the

  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see dirt at (7, 2) and dirt at (8, 3).
  Thinking: Currently, I am at (7, 2), which is both my current position and a location with dirt. The global scan shows that the nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 8 units away — a significant distance. There is no apple visible in the immediate vicinity, and the only dirt noted is at (7, 2) and (8, 3). 

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward**:  
   There is no apple at (7, 2) or (8, 3). The nearest apple is far away. Eating an apple would require moving to a location where one is present. Since no apple is nearby, this option yields zero immediate benefit. It would be premature and inefficient to eat an apple now.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning**:  
   Dirt removal is essential for apples to spawn. The current dirt at (7, 2) and (8, 3) must be cleaned to allow apples to appear in those areas or nearby. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is reduced), cleaning this dirt is a necessary step toward future rewards. Even though it provides no immediate points, it enables

  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

You are currently at (7, 0).  
You see dirt at (6, 0) and (7, 0).  
The nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 6 units away.  
The nearest dirt is at (7, 0), meaning you are standing on dirt — so you are already at a dirt location.  

Important rule: **Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when there is less dirt).**  
So, cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning.  
But — you cannot eat an apple unless it's already on land.  
Currently, there are no visible apples, and the nearest apple is 6 units away — far from your current position.

Now, evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
→ There is no apple visible at (7, 0) or nearby. The nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 6 steps away. You cannot eat it yet.  
→ Eating an apple is not possible right now. So this option is invalid.

   But there is *no apple visible* at (8, 7). The nearest apple is at (13, 6), which is 6 steps away. There are no apples in immediate range. So, **no apple can be eaten now**.

2. **Clean dirt** → no immediate reward, but necessary to enable future apple spawning.  
   Dirt at (7,6), (8,7), and (6,8) must be cleaned to allow apples to spawn.

I am currently at (7, 2). The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away. The nearest dirt is at (8, 3), which is only 2 units away — very close. 

Key facts:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed).
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but enables future apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.
- I cannot move diagonally — so movement is constrained to cardinal directions.

Right now, there is no apple in immediate range (the nearest is 5 units away). The dirt at (8,3) is only 2 units away — that's very close. 

So, should I eat an apple now?  
→ No. There is no apple visible in my current position or nearby. I am at (7,2), and the nearest apple is at (12,2), which is far. Eating an apple would be a wasted action with no immediate benefit.

Should I clean the dirt at (8,3)?

--- Step 5 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see dirt at (8, 3).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (8, 3).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — a significant distance. Eating it would give +1.0 immediately, but it's not close or guaranteed.
- The dirt at (8, 3) is only 2 units away from my current position (7, 2), meaning it's very accessible. Cleaning it is a low-effort, high-impact action that directly improves the environment.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be removed. By cleaning (8, 3), I'm enabling future apple spawns, which benefits the group and increases long-term rewards.
- There's no immediate apple available nearby, and the current situation suggests that future apple availability is directly tied to cleaning actions.
- Moving diagonally is not allowed, so I must move in cardinal directions. From (7,2), I can go to (8,2) or (6,2) first — both are valid and lead toward (8,3) via one step.

Therefore, cleaning the dirt is the optimal short-term action: it enables future apple spawning, aligns with the game’s core mechanics
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 3}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 0). You see dirt at (6, 0).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 0) and see dirt at (6, 0), which is just one step away. The nearest apple is at (1, 0), which is 6 units away — far from my current position. There are no apples visible in my immediate vicinity, and the only nearby apple is quite distant.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple at my current position (7, 0), and the nearest apple is at (1, 0), which is far away. Eating an apple would require moving to that location, which is not efficient or immediately beneficial. Since no apple is available now, this option yields zero reward and wastes time.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   This is critical. Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be removed. Currently, there is dirt at (6, 0), and removing it will make the environment more favorable for apples to appear in the future. Since the nearest apple is 6 units away, and we have a dirt patch only one step from us, cleaning it is a strategic move. It doesn’t give immediate reward, but it enables future
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 7). You see dirt at (7, 6) and dirt at (6, 8).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to decide the best course of action.

Current position: (8, 7)  
Visible dirt: (7, 6) and (6, 8)  
Nearest apple: (13, 7), distance = 5  
Nearest dirt: (7, 6), distance = 2  

The key trade-off is between immediate reward (eating an apple) and long-term benefit (cleaning dirt to enable future apple spawning).

Let’s break it down:

1. **Immediate reward (apple eating)**  
   - Apple at (13, 7) is 5 units away — that’s a reasonable distance.  
   - To reach it, I’d need to move: (8,7) → (7,7) → (6,7) → (5,7) → (4,7) → (3,7) → (2,7) → (1,7) → (0,7) → (1,7) → (2,7) → (3,7) → (4,7) → (5,7) → (6,7) → (7,7) → (8,7) → (9

--- Step 6 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 2). You see dirt at (8, 3).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (8, 3).

Here's why:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 4 steps away — not immediately accessible. Eating it now would give +1.0 point, but it would be a short-term gain with no guarantee of future rewards.
- However, the dirt at (8, 3) is only 1 step away — very close. Cleaning it will improve the river's cleanliness, which increases the chance of apples spawning in the future. This is a necessary precondition for apple generation.
- Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, cleaning dirt is not just beneficial — it's essential. Without cleaning, even if we move toward apples, they won’t appear.
- There is no immediate apple nearby to eat (the closest is 4 steps away), and no clear incentive to move further without first improving the environment.
- The goal is to maximize points over time, not just in the short term. Cleaning dirt enables future apple spawns, which can lead to more points in the long run.

Therefore, the optimal strategy is to clean the dirt at (8, 3) first. This action directly supports the system's condition for apple spawning, ensuring future opportunities for earning
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 3}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 0). You see dirt at (6, 0).
  Thinking: I am at (6, 0), where there is dirt. The nearest apple is at (1, 0), which is 5 units away — a significant distance. There is no immediate apple available at my current position. 

The key trade-off is between:
- **Eating an apple** for +1.0 immediate reward, or  
- **Cleaning dirt** to enable future apple spawning (which is essential for long-term success, as apples only spawn when the river is clean).

Right now, there is no apple at (6, 0) — only dirt. So, I cannot eat an apple immediately. Therefore, **option 1 is not viable**.

Option 2 — cleaning dirt — is critical. Dirt blocks apple spawning. Since apples only appear when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt), removing dirt at (6, 0) will help create conditions for apples to spawn in the future, possibly even at (1, 0) or nearby. This supports the group’s long-term goal.

Moreover, cleaning dirt is a necessary prerequisite for apple generation. Without cleaning, even if apples exist elsewhere, they won’t appear. Thus, **cleaning the dirt at (6, 0) is a strategic investment
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 7). You see dirt at (7, 6) and dirt at (6, 8).
  Thinking: Given the current situation, I need to carefully analyze the trade-off between immediate reward and long-term benefit.

**Current Position:** (7, 7)  
**Immediate surroundings:**  
- Dirt at (7, 6) — just one step away (distance 1)  
- Dirt at (6, 8) — distance √2 ≈ 1.41 (diagonally, but cannot move diagonally — so must go via (6,7) or (7,8))  

**Global Scan Highlights:**  
- Nearest Apple is at (13, 7), 6 steps away.  
- The only dirt that is directly accessible is at (7, 6), just one step from current position.  
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — implying that dirt must be removed to enable apple spawning.  
- There is no apple currently visible nearby (closest is 6 steps away), so no immediate apple is available for eating.

**Option 1: Eat an apple?**  
- No apple is currently reachable. The nearest is 6 steps away, and we have no apples in sight.  
- Eating an apple would require moving to (13,7) — which is far and

--- Step 7 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 3). You see dirt at (8, 3) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I am at (8, 3), where there is dirt, and I also see dirt at (7, 4). The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 steps away. Right now, there is no apple visible at my current position — only dirt. 

Let’s analyze the trade-offs:

1. **Should I eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There is no apple at (8, 3) or (7, 4). I cannot eat an apple right now. Eating apples only gives +1.0 per apple, but they only spawn *when the river is clean*, which means dirt must be cleaned first. Since no apples are currently available, eating one is not possible. So this option is invalid at this moment.

2. **Should I clean dirt to ensure future apples spawn?**  
- Cleaning the dirt at (8, 3) will improve the environment for future apple spawning, especially since the nearest apple is at (12, 2), which lies on a path that may pass
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 3}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 0). You see dirt at (6, 0).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 0).

Here's the reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible in immediate reach (the nearest apple is at (1, 0), 6 units away), and we are at (7, 0), so we cannot reach it without first cleaning dirt.
- The dirt at (6, 0) is only 1 unit away — a very short distance — meaning we can clean it efficiently with minimal movement.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed). Since apples are currently not spawning, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple generation.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 point, but it's not possible to reach one without first cleaning the dirt at (6, 0). Without cleaning, no apples will spawn, and the game will remain stuck in a state of no reward.
- The goal is to maximize points over time. Immediate apple consumption gives a short-term gain, but without cleaning, future apple spawns are impossible. Thus, cleaning dirt enables long-term reward.
- Since we can move one step left to (6, 0) to clean it (a simple action), and this action enables future apple spawning (which

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 7). You see dirt at (7, 6) and dirt at (6, 8).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision as Agent 3.

Current position: (8, 7)  
Visible dirt: (7, 6) and (6, 8)  
Nearest apple: (13, 7), distance = 5  
Nearest dirt: (7, 6), distance = 2  

First, consider the trade-off:

1. **Eating an apple for immediate reward (+1.0)**  
   - The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 5 steps away.  
   - There are no apples visible in immediate vicinity — the closest dirt is only 2 steps away.  
   - Eating an apple would give immediate +1.0, but it's not close.  
   - However, apples only spawn *when the river is clean* (i.e., when dirt is removed). So, if we don't clean dirt, apples won't spawn at all — even if they are far away.  
   - Therefore, eating an apple now would be **unwise** because there’s no apple currently available due to dirt blocking spawning.

2. **Cleaning dirt to enable future apple spawning**  
   - Dirt at (7,6

--- Step 6 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 2). You see dirt at (8, 3).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (8, 3).

Reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible or nearby in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 4 units away — far from where I currently am at (8, 2). Eating an apple now would not be possible due to the lack of proximity.
- The dirt at (8, 3) is directly adjacent and only 1 step away — this is a critical resource because apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed). Cleaning this dirt will improve the environment and enable future apple spawning, which benefits the group.
- There is no immediate reward for eating an apple now because no apple is accessible. The action of eating would require movement to an apple, which is not currently possible or efficient.
- Moving to clean the dirt is a necessary step to enable future apple generation. This aligns with the long-term goal of maximizing points through sustainable apple harvesting.
- Since I cannot move diagonally, the only viable path is to move step-by-step. Cleaning (8, 3) is the most immediate and impactful action given the current state.

Therefore, the optimal decision is to clean the dirt at (8
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 3}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 0). You see dirt at (6, 0).
  Thinking: I am at (6, 0), and I see dirt at that exact location. The nearest apple is at (1, 0), which is 5 units away — a significant distance. Right now, there is no apple visible nearby, and the only dirt is at my current position. 

Let’s evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple at (6, 0). I see dirt, not an apple. Eating an apple requires being on land with one present. Since no apple is visible at my current position, I cannot eat one immediately. So this option is not viable.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   This is a critical point. The global rule states: *Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (less dirt = more apples)*. Currently, there is dirt at (6, 0), and this dirt prevents apple spawning in that area. Cleaning it would make the land "clean" and potentially allow apples to spawn later — possibly at (1, 0) or elsewhere. Since the nearest apple is at (1, 0), which is 5 units away, and there’s no indication of apple spawning currently
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 7). You see dirt at (7, 6) and dirt at (6, 8).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 6).

Reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 6 units away — far enough that immediate consumption would require significant movement and time.
- The dirt at (7, 6) is only 1 unit away (directly above me at (7, 7)), making it extremely accessible.
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple generation. Since we are in a cleanup game where long-term success depends on enabling apple spawning, cleaning dirt is not just beneficial but essential.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 reward, but it would be a short-term gain with no guarantee of future apples. Moreover, if we don't clean the dirt, future apple spawns (including the one at (13, 7)) may not occur at all.
- There is no immediate apple nearby (the nearest is at (13, 7)), and we are already at (7, 7). Moving to clean dirt is the most efficient action to enable future rewards.
- Cleaning dirt does not give immediate points, but it enables the system to produce apples — which is the core objective

--- Step 7 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 3). You see dirt at (8, 3) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I am at (8, 3), which is currently covered in dirt. The global scan shows that the nearest apple is at (12, 2), 5 units away — that's a significant distance. There's also dirt at (7, 4), which is adjacent to my current position. 

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple visible at (8, 3) or (7, 4). The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which requires movement. Since I am currently on dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), I cannot eat an apple right now. So, *eating an apple is not possible at this moment*. This option is invalid.

2. **Clean dirt to ensure future apples spawn?**  
   This is critical. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be removed. Currently, I am on dirt at (8, 3), and there's also dirt at (7, 4). Cleaning this dirt is a prerequisite for future apple spawning. Even though cleaning doesn't give immediate points, it enables future rewards. Since

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 0). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I am at (6, 0). The nearest apple is at (1, 0), which is 5 units away — a significant distance. The nearest dirt is at (8, 3), also 5 units away. 

Let’s evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   - The apple at (1, 0) is directly to the left along the x-axis. Since I’m at (6, 0), I would need to move left to (1, 0) — a 5-step journey.  
   - However, eating an apple gives +1.0 point, which is immediate and valuable.  
   - But: Apples only spawn *when the river is clean*. This implies that apples are not guaranteed — they are conditional on dirt being cleaned. If the river is dirty, apples won’t appear.  
   - Therefore, if I eat an apple now, I’m consuming a resource that may not be sustainable or available long-term. Moreover, I’m not near any dirt, so I can’t clean anything to enable future apple spawns.

2. **Clean dirt to ensure future apples spawn?**  
- Cleaning dirt at (8, 3) is a strategic move that enables future apple spawning. Even though it provides no immediate reward, it directly supports the long-term goal of
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 3}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 0). You see dirt at (6, 0).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 0).

Here's the reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible in my immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (1, 0), which is 6 units away — far beyond a practical reach for immediate consumption.
- The only dirt visible is at (6, 0), just one step away from my current position (7, 0). This is a very accessible target.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be removed. By cleaning this dirt, I enable the possibility of apple spawning in the future, which directly supports the group’s goal of maximizing points.
- Eating an apple now would give a +1.0 reward, but there are no apples available at the moment. Even if one were within reach, it would be a wasted action without contributing to long-term success.
- Moving toward the dirt at (6, 0) is a logical first step: it's the only action that advances the system toward apple spawning. It’s a necessary precondition for future rewards.
- Since I cannot move diagonally, I can only move up/down/left/right. From (7,0), moving left to (6,0) is valid and efficient.

Therefore,
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 7). You see dirt at (7, 6) and dirt at (6, 8).

Current position: (8, 7)  
Visible dirt: (7, 6) and (6, 8)  
Nearest apple: (13, 7), distance = 5  
Nearest dirt: (7, 6), distance = 2  

Let’s break down the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward**:  
   The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 5 steps away. While eating apples gives +1.0 per apple, this is a one-time reward with no long-term benefit. However, apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. If we don’t clean dirt, apples won’t appear. So, if we skip cleaning now, future apple spawns may be blocked.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawns**:  
   The nearest dirt is at (7,6), just 2 steps away. Cleaning it would allow apples to spawn in the future, which benefits the group. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apple generation. Even though cleaning gives no immediate reward, it enables the possibility of future

--- Step 6 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 2). You see dirt at (8, 3).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (8, 3).

Here's the reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible in immediate range (the nearest apple is at (12, 2), 4 units away), and we are at (8, 2), so we cannot reach it without first clearing obstacles.
- The only dirt we see is directly ahead at (8, 3), just one step away. This is a very low-effort action.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be removed to enable apple spawning. Since the nearest apple is far away, we must first make the environment conducive to apple growth by cleaning dirt.
- Eating an apple now is not possible because there are no apples in range. Even if one existed, the immediate reward would be zero since we can't reach it.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning. This is a strategic investment in long-term rewards.
- Moving to (8, 3) to clean it is a simple, safe, and necessary step. After cleaning, we can then proceed toward (12, 2) or explore further areas where apples may spawn.

Therefore, the optimal action is to clean the dirt at (8
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 3}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 0). You see dirt at (6, 0).
  Thinking: I am at (6, 0), and I see dirt at the same location. The nearest apple is at (1, 0), which is 5 units away — a significant distance. Right now, there is no apple available for immediate consumption, and the dirt at (6, 0) is the only dirt visible in the global scan.

Key considerations:

1. **Immediate Reward (Eating an Apple):**  
   There is no apple currently visible or accessible at (6, 0). The nearest apple is at (1, 0), requiring movement leftward across the map. Since I cannot move diagonally, I would need to move step-by-step from (6, 0) to (5, 0), then (4, 0), etc., to reach (1, 0). This is a long journey, and there's no guarantee that apples will spawn along the way — they only spawn when the river is clean. Therefore, eating an apple now is not possible.

2. **Cleaning Dirt to Enable Future Apple Spawning:**  
   The dirt at (6, 0) is the only dirt visible. Cleaning it would reduce the total dirt in the environment, which increases the chance of apples spawning later —

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 7). You see dirt at (7, 6) and dirt at (6, 8).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to determine the best course of action.

Current position: (7, 7)  
Visible dirt: (7, 6) and (6, 8)  
Nearest apple: (13, 7), distance 6  
Nearest dirt: (7, 6), distance 1  

Key facts:
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. This means dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately, but only if an apple is present.
- Cleaning dirt has no immediate reward but is essential for future apple spawning.
- I cannot move diagonally — only up, down, left, right.

Observation: There is dirt at (7, 6), which is just one step away from my current position. That's the closest dirt to me. Cleaning it would directly contribute to making land clean and enabling apple spawning — possibly leading to apples appearing in nearby areas.

Now, consider the trade-off:

1. **Eat an apple?**  
   The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 6 steps away. There's no apple visible at (7, 7) or nearby. I

  Thinking: I am at (8, 3), and the current observation shows dirt at both (8, 3) and (7, 4). The global scan confirms that the nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 steps away, and the nearest dirt is at (8, 3) — meaning I am already standing on dirt.

Let’s analyze the trade-offs:

1. **Should I eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple currently visible at my position. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 steps away. Since apples only spawn *when the river is clean* (i.e., when dirt is removed), and currently there is dirt present, no apple is available to eat. Therefore, eating an apple is not possible right now. Attempting to eat an apple would be futile — no apple exists in the current state.

2. **Should I clean dirt to ensure future apples spawn?**  
   Yes — this is critical. Dirt removal is the prerequisite for apple spawning. The presence of dirt at (8, 3) and (7, 4) means that apples cannot spawn in those areas or nearby until cleaned. By cleaning the dirt,
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 3}} -> Env Action: 'clean'
Moving from (6, 0) towards (5, 0).
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 0). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I am at (6, 0). The nearest apple is at (1, 0), which is 5 units away — directly to the left along the x-axis. The nearest dirt is at (8, 3), which is 5 units away in a diagonal direction (down-right). Since I cannot move diagonally, I must move step-by-step in cardinal directions.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple at (1, 0)**:  
   - Immediate reward: +1.0 point.  
   - However, the apple is 5 steps away, and I must move through potentially dirty terrain.  
   - More importantly, apples only spawn when the river is clean — i.e., when dirt is removed.  
   - If I eat the apple now, I’m consuming a resource that may only exist *because* the river is clean. If the dirt at (8, 3) is not cleaned, apples may not spawn in the future.  
   - But — there is no indication that apples are currently spawning. The global scan says the nearest apple is at (1, 0), suggesting it may be available now.  
- Cleaning dirt has no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning. Given that apples are not currently spawning (because the river is
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 3}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 0). You see dirt at (6, 0).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 0), and I see dirt at (6, 0), which is just one step away. The nearest apple is at (1, 0), which is 6 steps away — far beyond my current position. Eating that apple would require a long journey and would not be immediately beneficial, especially since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed).

The key insight is this: **apples only spawn on land when the river is clean**. That means dirt must be cleaned to enable apple growth. Right now, there is dirt at (6, 0), which is adjacent to me. Cleaning it would not only make the land viable for apples but also bring me closer to the apple at (1, 0) in a future state — because once the river is clean, apples can appear on land, and eventually, we can reach them.

There is no immediate reward in eating an apple here — the nearest one is too far away, and there's no indication that any apple is currently spawning due to the dirt. Moreover, cleaning the dirt at (6, 0) is a necessary step to enable future apple spawning. It's a foundational action for long-term success.

Therefore,
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 7). You see dirt at (7, 6) and dirt at (6, 8).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the trade-off between immediate reward and long-term benefits.

Currently, I'm at (8, 7). The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 5 units away — a moderate distance. However, there is dirt at (7, 6) and (6, 8), both of which are within reach. The nearest dirt is at (7, 6), just 2 units away (distance = |8-7| + |7-6| = 1 + 1 = 2).

Key points:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be removed.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but enables future apple spawning.
- I can only move in cardinal directions (up, down, left, right), not diagonally.
- The goal is to maximize points: apples give +1.0 each, cleaning dirt has no direct reward but enables future apples.

Now, evaluating the options:

1. **Eat an apple immediately?**  
   The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 5 steps away. I would need to move there and eat it. But if I do that now, I’m leaving behind dirt

--- Step 6 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 2). You see dirt at (8, 3).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (8, 3).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 4 units away — far enough that immediate apple consumption would not be efficient or optimal.
- The dirt at (8, 3) is only 1 unit away, meaning it's very close and easily accessible.
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple generation. Without cleaning, no apples can appear, even if they're nearby.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 reward, but if the dirt remains uncleaned, future apple spawning is blocked, which could result in no apples ever appearing — a long-term loss.
- Since the dirt is adjacent and reachable in one move, cleaning it is a low-effort, high-impact action that enables future apple spawns.
- There is no immediate benefit to eating an apple now, given that apples are not spawning due to the dirty state. The group's long-term success depends on clean land, not immediate consumption.

Therefore, cleaning the dirt at (8, 3) is the optimal choice: it enables future apple spawning, supports the group's goals, and requires
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 3}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 0). You see dirt at (6, 0).
  Thinking: I am at (6, 0), and I see dirt at that exact location. The nearest apple is at (1, 0), which is 5 units away — quite far. There is no apple currently visible or nearby, and the only dirt is right where I am.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple at (6, 0). The nearest apple is 5 steps away, and I have no evidence that any apple is currently spawning or accessible. Eating an apple would require movement and would only be beneficial if one were immediately available. Since no apple is present, this option yields zero reward and is not viable.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   This is critical. The rule states: *Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (less dirt = more apples)*. Right now, there is dirt at (6, 0), and the system is not allowing apple spawning. Cleaning this dirt would make the land "clean" and enable apples to spawn in the future — possibly even at (1, 0) or nearby. Even though cleaning gives no immediate reward, it is a prerequisite for apple spawning. Since
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 7). You see dirt at (7, 6) and dirt at (6, 8).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 6).

Here’s the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 6 units away — far enough that immediate apple consumption would not be efficient, especially since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed).
- The dirt at (7, 6) is only 1 unit away — very close — and cleaning it would directly improve the river's cleanliness, enabling apple spawning in the future.
- Eating an apple now would give a +1.0 reward, but it would not contribute to long-term sustainability or future apple generation. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, we are essentially missing out on potential future rewards by not cleaning dirt.
- The dirt at (6, 8) is farther away (distance 2 from current position), so it's less urgent than (7, 6).
- Cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apple spawning. Without cleaning, even if an apple appears, it won’t be sustainable or available.
- Since we are in a group-based cleanup game, the collective benefit of enabling future apple spawns outweighs the immediate gain from eating one apple.

Therefore, the optimal action is to clean the dirt

--- Step 7 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 3). You see dirt at (8, 3) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I am at (8, 3), which is currently covered in dirt. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), 5 steps away. However, apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be removed to create habitable terrain for apples to appear. Right now, there is dirt at (8, 3) and (7, 4), and since apples don't spawn on dirt, I cannot eat any apple immediately.

Option 1: Eat an apple?  
→ Not possible. There is no apple currently visible on land. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 steps away and currently behind dirt. Since apples only spawn on clean land, I cannot access it yet. Eating an apple is not feasible right now.

Option 2: Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?  
→ Yes, this is essential. Cleaning dirt at (8, 3) or (7, 4) will make land available, which is a prerequisite for apple spawning. Even though cleaning gives no immediate reward, it enables future apple generation — directly supporting the group’s long-term goal. Since apples are the only source of points, enabling their spawning is a strategic necessity.

Option
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 3}} -> Env Action: 'clean'
- Cleaning dirt does not give immediate points, but it enables the possibility of apples appearing in the future —
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 3}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 0). You see dirt at (6, 0).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 0), and I see dirt at (6, 0), which is just one step away. The nearest apple is at (1, 0), which is 6 steps away — far beyond my current reach. There are no apples in sight, and the only immediate apple is unreachable without first cleaning the dirt.

Let’s evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple** — There is no apple in my vicinity. The nearest apple is at (1, 0), which is 6 units away. I cannot reach it without first clearing the dirt at (6, 0) or moving through the terrain. Since no apples are currently available to eat, this option is not viable.

2. **Clean dirt** — This is a critical step. Dirt blocks apple spawning. The rule states that apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt). Cleaning the dirt at (6, 0) will make it possible for apples to appear in the future, especially in areas like (1, 0) or nearby. Since the nearest apple is at (1, 0), and it’s currently not spawning (likely due to dirt blocking), cleaning the dirt at (6, 0) is
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 7). You see dirt at (7, 6) and dirt at (6, 8).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

You are at (8, 7).  
You see dirt at (7, 6) and (6, 8).  
The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 5 units away.  
The nearest dirt is at (7, 6), which is only 2 units away — very close.  

### Option 1: Eat an apple for immediate reward  
- Apples give +1.0 each, which is a direct point gain.  
- However, apples only spawn when the river is clean — i.e., when dirt is removed.  
- Right now, there is dirt present, and apples are not spawning.  
- The apple at (13, 7) is not currently visible or accessible without first cleaning the dirt.  
- If you eat an apple, you get a point, but only if one exists.  
- **But:** There is no indication that an apple is currently available at (13, 7) — it's only "nearest" and requires a clean river.  
- Since the river is not clean (dirt exists), apples are not spawning.  
→ **Conclusion:** You cannot eat an apple now. No apple is

--- Step 6 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 2). You see dirt at (8, 3).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (8, 3).

Reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 4 units away — quite far and not immediately accessible.
- There is dirt directly adjacent at (8, 3), just one step away. Cleaning this dirt will improve the river's cleanliness, which in turn increases the likelihood of apples spawning in the future.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apple generation. Without cleaning, even if apples exist, they won't appear.
- Eating an apple now would give a +1.0 reward, but there are no apples visible in the immediate vicinity (the nearest is 4 steps away), and we have no confirmation that apples are currently spawning due to the dirty state.
- Cleaning dirt provides no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning, which aligns with the group's long-term goal of maximizing points through sustainable apple production.
- Since movement is restricted to cardinal directions (no diagonals), moving from (8,2) to (8,3) is straightforward and efficient.

Therefore, the optimal action is to clean the dirt at (8,3). This action directly supports the condition required for apple spawning
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 3}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 0). You see dirt at (6, 0).
  Thinking: I am at (6, 0), and I see dirt at that exact location. The nearest apple is at (1, 0), which is 5 units away — quite far. Right now, there is no apple visible nearby, and the only dirt is at my current position.

Let’s analyze the trade-off:

1. **Should I eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There is no apple at (6, 0). I cannot eat an apple here. The nearest apple is 5 units away, and I would have to move to reach it. Since I’m not currently adjacent to any apple, eating one is not possible right now. So this option is not viable.

2. **Should I clean dirt to ensure future apples spawn?**  
   → Yes. Dirt is currently at (6, 0), and apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed). Cleaning this dirt would convert it into usable land, enabling apple spawning in the future. Even though there's no immediate reward, this action supports the group’s long-term goal. Since apples are not spawning now (due to dirt), cleaning is essential to enable future apple generation.

3. **If nothing is nearby,
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 7). You see dirt at (7, 6) and dirt at (6, 8).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to determine the best course of action.

Currently, I am at (7, 7). There is dirt at (7, 6) and (6, 8). The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 6 steps away. The nearest dirt is at (7, 6), just one step away — this is very close and directly adjacent.

Key considerations:
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately, which is a direct reward.
- Cleaning dirt does not give immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning — which benefits the group long-term.
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed). So, if I don’t clean dirt, apples won’t appear in those areas.
- I cannot move diagonally, so movement is constrained to cardinal directions (up, down, left, right).

Right now, I have a dirt block directly in front of me at (7, 6). Cleaning it would be a simple one-step action. After cleaning, that spot becomes land — and if apples spawn, they could appear there or in adjacent areas. But currently, the only apple is far away at (13

--- Step 7 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 3). You see dirt at (8, 3) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the current situation to determine the best course of action.

Current position: (8, 3)  
Observed dirt: at (8, 3) and (7, 4)  
Nearest apple: at (12, 2), distance = 5  
Nearest dirt: at (8, 3), distance = 0  

Key facts:
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Clean river = less dirt.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.
- I cannot move diagonally — only up, down, left, right.

Right now, I am standing on dirt at (8, 3). That means I'm not on clean land. Therefore, no apples can spawn at my current location or nearby unless dirt is cleaned.

The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 steps away. To reach it, I would need to:
- Move from (8, 3) → (8, 4) → (8, 5) → (9, 5) → (10, 5) → (11,
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 3}} -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 0). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I am at (6, 0). The nearest apple is at (1, 0), which is 5 units away — directly to the left along the x-axis. The nearest dirt is at (8, 3), which is 5 units away in a diagonal direction (not directly reachable without moving through terrain).

Let’s analyze the trade-offs:

1. **Eating an apple for immediate reward**:  
   Apples give +1.0 each. If I move to (1, 0), I can eat it and gain 1 point immediately. However, the apple is far away (distance 5), and I can only move in cardinal directions (up/down/left/right). This means I would need to travel 5 steps to reach it — a significant effort with no immediate benefit from intermediate actions. Also, if I eat an apple, it may not spawn again — and if the river is not clean, apples don't spawn at all. So, eating an apple now might be a short-term gain, but it doesn’t address the root issue: the river is dirty, and apples depend on cleanliness.

2. **Cleaning dirt to enable future apple spawning**:  
- Since apples don’t spawn unless the river is clean, if I don’t clean dirt now, future
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 3}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 0). You see dirt at (6, 0).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 0), and I see dirt at (6, 0), which is just one step away. The nearest apple is at (1, 0), 6 units away — far beyond my current reach. There are no apples in immediate proximity, and I cannot eat any now.

Let’s analyze the trade-off:

1. **Should I eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → No apples are available at this moment. The nearest apple is 6 units away, and I have no path to it without first clearing obstacles. Eating an apple is not possible right now. So this option is invalid.

2. **Should I clean dirt to ensure future apples spawn?**  
   → Yes. Dirt at (6, 0) is adjacent and directly reachable. Cleaning it would reduce dirt in the area, which improves the river’s cleanliness. This increases the chance of apples spawning in the future — especially since apples only appear when the river is clean. This action supports the group's long-term goal.  
   Moreover, cleaning dirt is a necessary prerequisite for apple spawning. Without reducing dirt, no apples will appear, regardless of how far they are.

3. **If nothing is nearby, where should I explore?**
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 7). You see dirt at (7, 6) and dirt at (6, 8).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to determine the best course of action.

I am currently at (8, 7).  
I see dirt at (7, 6) and (6, 8).  
The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 5 units away.  
The nearest dirt is at (7, 6), which is only 2 units away — very close.  

Key rules:
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when there is less dirt).
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but enables future apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.
- I cannot move diagonally.

Now, the trade-off:

1. **Eat an apple now?**  
   The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 5 steps away. I would have to move to reach it. There's no apple nearby (within 1–2 steps), so I can't eat one immediately. Eating one would require travel, which takes time and energy, and I'm not close to any apple. So, immediate apple consumption is not feasible right now.

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 2). You see dirt at (8, 3).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (8, 3).

Here’s the reasoning:

- There is currently no apple in immediate range that I can eat. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 4 steps away — far enough that it would require a full path to reach. Eating it would give +1.0, but it’s not available yet.
- The dirt at (8, 3) is only 1 step away — very close. Cleaning it would reduce the dirt level in the environment, which improves the river's cleanliness.
- According to the rules, apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. So, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple spawning. This action enables future rewards (apples) to appear, which is essential for long-term point accumulation.
- Since there's no immediate apple to eat and the dirt is right next to me, I can clean it immediately with no cost in movement or time.
- The trade-off between immediate reward and future reward: eating an apple now would give +1.0, but if I don’t clean the dirt, no apples will spawn — even if I later reach (12, 2), there would be no apples to eat. Therefore, cleaning

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 0). You see dirt at (6, 0).
  Thinking: At (6, 0), I am currently standing on dirt, and there are no apples visible in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (1, 0), which is 5 units away — quite far. There is no apple spawning currently because the river is not clean (dirt is present). 

Key observations:
- Eating an apple now is not possible because there is no apple at (6, 0). The only apple is 5 steps away, and I would need to move to reach it.
- Cleaning the dirt at (6, 0) would not immediately give me points, but it contributes to making the environment cleaner — which enables apples to spawn in the future.
- Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple generation.
- The global scan shows no apples are currently spawning — this is due to the presence of dirt. Therefore, without cleaning, no apples will appear, even if I move.

Trade-off analysis:
- Option 1 (Eat an apple): Not feasible — no apple is at my current position, and the nearest is far away. I cannot eat it now.
- Option 2 (Clean dirt): This is necessary.
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 7). You see dirt at (7, 6) and dirt at (6, 8).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 6).

Reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 6 units away — quite distant. Eating it would give +1.0 immediately, but it’s not close or likely to be available soon due to the current dirt conditions.
- The dirt at (7, 6) is only 1 unit away — very close and directly accessible. Cleaning it would improve the river’s cleanliness, which is a prerequisite for apples to spawn.
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. So, by removing dirt, I’m enabling future apple generation — a long-term benefit that supports the group’s goal.
- There is no immediate apple nearby (the nearest is at (13, 7)), and no other dirt is listed as being within close range. Therefore, there's no immediate reward to be gained from eating an apple now.
- Since I cannot move diagonally, moving to (7, 6) is straightforward (one step down), and cleaning it is a low-cost, high-impact action.

Thus, the optimal decision is to clean the dirt at (7, 6). This action enables future apple spawning and aligns with the group

  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision.

Current position: (8, 3)  
Observations: Dirt at (8, 3) and (7, 4)  
Global scan: Nearest apple is at (12, 2), 5 steps away. Nearest dirt is at (8, 3), distance 0 — meaning we are already on dirt.

Key facts:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean, i.e., when there is less dirt. Cleaning dirt removes it and enables apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but is essential for future apple spawning.
- We are currently standing on dirt at (8, 3), and there's another dirt at (7, 4).

Trade-off analysis:

1. **Eat an apple?**  
   The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 steps away. To reach it, we'd need to move through potentially dirty terrain. But right now, we're on dirt — no apple is available for immediate consumption. There is no apple visible at (8, 3) or (7, 4). So, **
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 3}} -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 0). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the current situation and make a strategic decision based on the rules and goals.

Currently, I am at (6, 0). The nearest apple is at (1, 0), which is 5 units away — a significant distance. The nearest dirt is at (8, 3), also 5 units away. There's no immediate apple visible nearby, and the observation says "you see nothing of interest nearby," which suggests that no apple is currently in direct view.

Let’s break down the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward**:  
   The apple at (1, 0) is 5 units away — I would need to move left to reach it. But since I can only move in cardinal directions (up, down, left, right), and I'm at (6, 0), moving to (1, 0) requires 5 steps left. That's a long path. However, the rule says apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning apples are not guaranteed to exist unless dirt is cleaned. If there's no dirt cleaned, apples may not spawn at all. So, if I don't clean dirt, future apple spawning is blocked.

- The dirt is adjacent and accessible — I can move to (8, 3) via (7, 3) or (8, 2), then
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 3}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 0). You see dirt at (6, 0).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully.

I am at position (7, 0), and I see dirt at (6, 0). The nearest apple is at (1, 0), which is 6 units away — quite far. The nearest dirt is only 1 unit away, at (6, 0). 

Right now, there are no apples visible in immediate range, and the only apple is far away. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), cleaning dirt is essential to enable future apple spawning. 

Even though eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately, there are no apples currently accessible. The apple at (1, 0) is too far to reach without first cleaning the dirt at (6, 0), which is directly adjacent. 

Moreover, the dirt at (6, 0) is the only dirt in the global scan — suggesting it might be a critical bottleneck. If we don’t clean it, no apples will spawn in the area, and the group will not be able to gain apples at all. 

Therefore, the immediate reward of eating an apple is not available — there's nothing to eat. The only meaningful action is to clean the dirt at (
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 7). You see dirt at (7, 6) and dirt at (6, 8).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision.

Current position: (8, 7)  
Visible dirt: (7, 6) and (6, 8)  
Nearest apple: (13, 7), distance = 5  
Nearest dirt: (7, 6), distance = 2  

Key facts:
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward but is necessary for future apple spawning.
- Movement is only allowed in cardinal directions (up, down, left, right), no diagonals.

Now, evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple?**  
   The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 5 steps away. There is no apple in immediate vicinity (within 1 step). The dirt at (7,6) is only 2 steps away, so we could reach it quickly. But there's no apple at (8,7) or nearby. Eating an apple now would require moving to (13,7), which is far and time-consuming. Since there's no apple in range

--- Step 6 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 2). You see dirt at (8, 3).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (8, 3).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 4 units away — quite far. Eating it would give a +1.0 reward, but it's not immediately accessible or likely to be the only apple available.
- The dirt at (8, 3) is just one step away — a very small effort to clean. Cleaning dirt does not give immediate reward, but it is essential for enabling apples to spawn in the future. This means that without cleaning dirt, apples may not appear at all, or may be absent in key areas like (12, 2).
- Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple availability. This directly supports the group’s long-term goal of maximizing apple collection.
- There's no immediate benefit to eating an apple now — the apple is far away, and there’s no indication that it will respawn or that it's the only one available. Moreover, if we don’t clean the dirt, we risk missing future apple spawns entirely.
- Moving to (8, 3) is a simple, low-risk action (one step),
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 3}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 0). You see dirt at (6, 0).
  Thinking: I am at (6, 0), and I see dirt at that exact location. The nearest apple is at (1, 0), which is 5 units away — a significant distance. There is no immediate apple available at my current position. 

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward**:  
   There is no apple at (6, 0). The nearest apple is at (1, 0), which is 5 steps away. I cannot eat it now. Eating an apple would require movement and time. Since no apple is available immediately, this option is not viable.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning**:  
   Dirt at (6, 0) is present. Cleaning it would remove dirt and improve the river’s cleanliness, which increases the chance of apples spawning in the future. This action is essential for long-term success, as apples only spawn when the river is clean. Even though cleaning provides no immediate reward, it is a prerequisite for apple availability. Given that the nearest apple is far away and currently not spawning due to dirt, cleaning this dirt is a necessary step to enable future apple growth.

3. **Explore elsewhere**:  
   The global scan shows no other dirt or apples nearby
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 7). You see dirt at (7, 6) and dirt at (6, 8).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 6).

Here's the reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible nearby. The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 6 units away — far out of reach with no immediate path to it. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), and we currently have dirt at (7, 6) (only 1 step away), we are at a critical threshold.
- Eating an apple now is not feasible — there are no apples in the immediate vicinity. Even if one were available, the global scan shows the nearest is far away, and no apple spawns on land unless the river is clean.
- Cleaning dirt at (7, 6) is a necessary step to enable future apple spawning. This action supports the group's long-term goal, as it increases the chance of apples appearing on land, which can then be eaten for points.
- The dirt at (6, 8) is farther away (distance 2 from current position), so it's less urgent than (7, 6), which is only one step away.
- Since no immediate apple is available and cleaning dirt enables future rewards, the optimal action is to clean the

--- Step 7 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 3). You see dirt at (8, 3) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I am at (8, 3), which is currently covered in dirt, and I also see dirt at (7, 4). The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 steps away — a reasonable distance, but not immediate. 

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple visible at my current location. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is not within reach of immediate consumption. Eating an apple would require moving to it first — and since apples only spawn *when the river is clean* (i.e., when dirt is removed), and currently there is dirt at (8,3) and (7,4), apples are not spawning yet. Therefore, **I cannot eat an apple right now**. Attempting to eat one would be futile — no apple is available at my current position.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   Yes — cleaning dirt is essential. Dirt at (8,3) and (7,4) are blocking apple spawning. By removing dirt, I am enabling the possibility of apples appearing in the future, which benefits the group. Cleaning is not rewarding in the
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 3}} -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 0). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: Given the current observation and global scan, I must carefully analyze the trade-off between immediate reward and long-term benefit.

I am currently at (6, 0). The nearest apple is at (1, 0), which is 5 units away — a significant distance. Since I can only move in cardinal directions (no diagonals), reaching it would require moving left 5 steps to (1, 0). However, there is no indication that any apple is currently spawning or visible nearby — the global scan confirms the apple is far away and not in immediate range.

Meanwhile, the nearest dirt is at (8, 3), also 5 units away. Cleaning dirt is essential because apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed). This means that without cleaning dirt, no apples will appear — even if I move toward the apple, it won't spawn. Therefore, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple generation.

Now, evaluating the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
→ Yes. This is the most strategic move. Cleaning dirt is essential to enable future apple spawning
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 3}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 0). You see dirt at (6, 0).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 0).

Here's the reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible in my immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (1, 0), which is 6 units away — far beyond my current reach.
- The dirt at (6, 0) is only 1 unit away — very close and directly adjacent.
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. This means that cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apple spawning. Without cleaning, no apples will appear, even if we move toward them.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 point, but there are no apples available to eat at this moment. The apple at (1,0) is not reachable without first clearing the path (which includes cleaning dirt).
- Cleaning dirt is not immediately rewarding, but it enables future apple spawning. Since apples are essential for scoring and the group's success, investing in cleaning now ensures that apples can eventually spawn in accessible areas.
- The river's cleanliness is a systemic condition — it's not just about current apples, but about enabling future ones. This is a long-term strategy that supports sustainable point accumulation.

Therefore, the best action is to clean the dirt at (6, 0
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 7). You see dirt at (7, 6) and dirt at (6, 8).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to decide the best course of action.

Current position: (8, 7)  
Visible dirt: (7, 6) and (6, 8)  
Nearest apple: (13, 7), distance = 5  
Nearest dirt: (7, 6), distance = 2  

First, consider the trade-off:

1. **Eating an apple for immediate reward**  
   - Apples give +1.0 each, which is a direct point gain.  
   - The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 5 steps away.  
   - However, apples only spawn *when the river is clean* — meaning dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning.  
   - There is no apple currently visible or nearby — the apple at (13,7) is not necessarily spawning yet; it may be dormant until the river is clean.  
   - Therefore, eating an apple now would be impossible unless one is already present.  
   - There is no indication of an apple at (8,7) or nearby. So, **no apple is immediately available to eat**.

2. **Cleaning dirt to enable future apple spawning**

--- Step 6 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 2). You see dirt at (8, 3).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (8, 3).

Here’s the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 4 units away. To reach it, I would need to move through several steps, and currently, there’s dirt at (8, 3) directly in front of me — a blockage.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 reward, but there are no apples visible nearby (the nearest is 4 units away), and no indication that apples are spawning or accessible without first cleaning the dirt.
- The dirt at (8, 3) is the nearest dirt, and cleaning it would improve the river's cleanliness, enabling apples to spawn in the future. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple availability.
- The current situation suggests a lack of immediate apple access — if I don’t clean the dirt, I will be unable to spawn apples in that region, and future apple availability will be blocked.
- Moving diagonally is not allowed, so I must move in cardinal directions. From (8,2), I can go to (8,3) to clean it — a single, logical step.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 0). You see dirt at (6, 0).
  Thinking: I am at (6, 0), directly on a dirt patch. The nearest apple is at (1, 0), which is 5 units away — a significant distance. Currently, there is no apple visible or accessible nearby, and the only dirt is at my current position. 

Let’s evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There is no apple at (6, 0). I see dirt, not an apple. Eating dirt gives no reward and is not allowed. So, I cannot eat an apple immediately. This option is invalid.

2. **Clean the dirt at (6, 0) to enable future apple spawning?**  
   → This is a valid and necessary action. The rule states that apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt). Currently, dirt exists at (6, 0), so the land is not clean. By cleaning this dirt, I reduce the dirt count, which increases the chance of apples appearing in the future — especially since the nearest apple is at (1, 0), which is on the same row. Cleaning dirt at (6, 0) may help "activate" or "enable" apple spawning in the

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 7). You see dirt at (7, 6) and dirt at (6, 8).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision.

Currently, I am at (7, 7). There is dirt at (7, 6) and (6, 8). The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 6 units away. The nearest dirt is at (7, 6), just one step away — so it's very close and easily accessible.

Let’s evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward**:  
   The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 6 steps away. To reach it, I’d need to move right to (8,7), then (9,7), ..., up to (13,7). That’s a long path. There’s no apple nearby — the closest apple is far away. Eating an apple now would require a significant journey, and there's no immediate reward benefit unless I can get one quickly. Also, apples only spawn when the river is clean, meaning dirt must be cleaned. If I don't clean dirt, no apples will appear. So, if I skip cleaning, I risk no apples ever spawning.

--- Step 7 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 3). You see dirt at (8, 3) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I am at (8, 3), which is currently covered in dirt, and I also see dirt at (7, 4). The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away. Right now, there are no apples visible in my immediate vicinity — the only available food is distant.

Let’s break down the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There is no apple at (8, 3) or (7, 4). The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 steps away. Eating an apple would require moving there first, and since apples only spawn *when the river is clean* (i.e., when dirt is removed), I cannot currently eat an apple. So, **eating an apple is not possible right now** — it's a false option based on a misunderstanding of the current state.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   → Yes, this is critical. Dirt removal is a prerequisite for apples to spawn. The current dirt at (8, 3) and (7, 4) prevents apple generation in those areas. By cleaning dirt, I am enabling the possibility of apples appearing
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 3}} -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 0). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I am at (6, 0). The nearest apple is at (1, 0), which is 5 units away — directly to the left along the x-axis. The nearest dirt is at (8, 3), which is 5 units away in the direction of increasing x and y. 

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward**:  
   Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately. The apple at (1, 0) is within reach (distance 5), and since movement is only allowed in cardinal directions (no diagonals), I can reach it in 5 steps. However, apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apples to exist in the first place. If I eat an apple now, I’m consuming a resource that may not be sustainable or available in the long term if the river remains dirty. Also, if I don’t clean the dirt, future apple spawns won’t occur — so I risk losing access to apples entirely.

2. **Clean the dirt at (8, 3)**:  
Moving from (6, 0) towards (1, 0).
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 0). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to make the best decision given the constraints and goals.

Current position: (6, 0)  
Nearest apple: (1, 0) — distance = 5  
Nearest dirt: (8, 3) — distance = 5  

Key facts:
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned).
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but enables future apple spawning (which benefits the group).
- Movement is only allowed in cardinal directions (no diagonals).
- The goal is to maximize points — both immediate and long-term.

Now, evaluating the options:

1. **Eat an apple at (1, 0)**  
   - Immediate +1.0 point.  
   - However, (1, 0) is 5 units away. That means a full path of 5 moves to reach it.  
   - After eating, you’re at (1, 0), but no apple spawns unless the river is clean.  
   - There's no indication that cleaning dirt is required *before* this apple appears — it's already there.  
   - But if we eat

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 6). You see dirt at (7, 6) and dirt at (6, 7).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 6), where there is dirt. I also observe dirt at (6, 7). The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 steps away. Right now, there are no apples visible in my immediate vicinity — only dirt. 

Let’s analyze the trade-offs:

1. **Eat an apple?**  
   There is no apple at (7, 6) or (6, 7). The nearest apple is 6 steps away. Eating an apple would require moving to it, which means first clearing dirt along the way. Since apples only spawn *when the river is clean* (i.e., when dirt is removed), there are currently no apples available for consumption. Therefore, **eating an apple is not possible right now** — attempting to do so would be futile.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   Yes. Dirt removal is essential for apples to spawn. The current dirt at (7, 6) and (6, 7) must be cleaned to allow apples to appear in the future. Since apples are not spawning now (due to dirt), cleaning is the only way to enable future rewards. This action supports the group’s long-term goal

--- Step 8 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 3). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to determine the best course of action.

Currently, I am at position (8, 3). The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 steps away. The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), which is only 2 steps away — very close. Dirt cleaning is essential because apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when there is less dirt). This means cleaning dirt enables future apple spawning, which benefits the group and ultimately leads to more points over time.

Now, evaluating the options:

1. **Eat an apple immediately**: The nearest apple is 5 steps away, and there is no apple in immediate proximity. There's no apple at (7,4) or nearby. Eating an apple would require moving to it, which is not urgent. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and we currently have dirt present, we are not currently in a state where apples are available — so eating one now would be impossible anyway. Thus, this option is not viable.

2. **Clean the dirt at (7,4)**: This is a high-priority action. Cleaning dirt improves the river's cleanliness, which increases the chance of apple spawning in the
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (5, 0). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to determine the best course of action.

Currently, I am at (5, 0). The nearest apple is at (1, 0), which is 4 units away — a relatively short distance. Eating that apple would give me an immediate +1.0 reward. However, apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning that cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple availability.

The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), which is 6 units away. That means I would need to travel to clean it, which takes time and effort, and there’s no immediate reward from cleaning. But cleaning it would eventually allow more apples to spawn, which benefits the group and increases long-term opportunities.

Right now, there's no visible dirt nearby — the nearest dirt is at (7,4), far from my current position. And the nearest apple is at (1,0), directly to the left along the x-axis. Since I can move only in cardinal directions (up, down, left, right), I can reach (1,0) in 4 moves — a feasible path.

But here's the key trade-off:  
- Eating the apple now gives me immediate +1.0.
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 1, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 6). You see dirt at (6, 7).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 6) and see dirt at (6, 7). The global scan shows that the nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 units away — quite far. The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), which is only 2 units away from my current position. That means I can reach it quickly.

Now, let’s analyze the trade-offs:

1. **Eating an apple for immediate reward**:  
   There are no apples visible in my immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is far away (distance 6), and I have no way of knowing if it’s currently spawnable — apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned). Since the current state has dirt present, apples are not spawning. So, eating an apple is not possible right now. Even if I were to move toward (2,5), I’d still need to clean dirt first to enable apple spawning. Thus, **eating an apple is not viable now**.

2. **Cleaning dirt to enable future apple spawning**:  
   This is critical. The rule states: *Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (less dirt = more apples)*. So, cleaning dirt

--- Step 9 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here’s the reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible in immediate range (the nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away), and there's no apple at (7, 4) or nearby.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is very close — just one step away — and cleaning it will improve the river's cleanliness, which is a prerequisite for apples to spawn.
- Apples only spawn *when the river is clean*. So, without cleaning dirt, no apples will appear, even if we walk far.
- Eating an apple now would give a +1.0 reward, but there are no apples available at the current location or nearby. The nearest apple is far away and dependent on the river being clean.
- Since the dirt is only 1 step away, cleaning it is a low-effort, high-impact action that enables future apple spawning. This supports the group's long-term goal.
- The trade-off is between immediate reward and enabling future reward. Given that no apples are currently available and apples depend on clean water, the immediate reward is not possible here.

Therefore, cleaning the dirt at (7, 4) is
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Moving from (4, 0) towards (3, 0).
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (4, 0). You see an apple at (2, 1).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (2, 1).

Here's the reasoning:

- The apple at (2, 1) is very close — only one step away horizontally and one step up, meaning it's just one move (up to (3,1), then left to (2,1)) or directly reachable in two moves (left to (3,0), then up to (2,1)? Wait — let's verify coordinates.

Wait — current position is (4, 0). Apple at (2, 1). 

To reach (2, 1) from (4, 0):
- Move left 2 steps: (4,0) → (3,0) → (2,0)
- Then move up 1 step: (2,0) → (2,1)

That’s 3 moves. So it's reachable, but not immediately adjacent.

Now, consider the trade-off:

1. **Immediate reward**: Eating the apple at (2,1) gives +1.0 point. This is a tangible, immediate gain. The apple is within reach and not blocked by dirt or water.

   → Yes. Dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning. The river (or land) only produces apples when it's clean. Since there is dirt at (8, 3) and (7, 4), cleaning it is essential to eventually get apples. Cleaning dirt has no immediate reward, but it's a necessary prerequisite for future apple spawns. Given that the nearest apple is
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 3}} -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 0). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the trade-off between immediate reward and long-term benefit.

Currently, I am at (6, 0). The nearest apple is at (1, 0), which is 5 units away — a significant distance. Eating it would give me +1.0 point immediately, but since I can't move diagonally and the path is likely blocked or requires clearing dirt first, I must consider whether that apple is even accessible now.

The nearest dirt is at (8, 3), also 5 units away. Dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning. Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning that cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple generation. Since apples are essential for scoring, cleaning dirt is a strategic investment in future rewards.

But here's the key: **apples only spawn when the river is clean**. That implies that the dirt is currently blocking apple spawning, and cleaning it will allow apples to appear in areas that would otherwise be barren. This makes cleaning dirt a necessary step to enable future apple spawns — not just a side activity.

Right now, I see no immediate apples or dirt to interact with. The nearest apple is far away, and the nearest dirt is also far. If I move toward the dirt
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 3}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 6). You see dirt at (7, 6) and dirt at (6, 7).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to determine the best course of action.

Currently, I am at (7, 6), which is both a dirt location and the nearest dirt globally (distance 0). There is also dirt at (6, 7). The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 steps away — a significant distance. 

Key points:
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. This means dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning, which benefits the group.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately, but only if an apple is present and accessible.
- I am currently standing on dirt — I cannot eat an apple here because there is no apple at (7,6).
- The nearest apple is far away (6 steps), and there is no apple visible in the immediate vicinity.

Therefore:
- Option 1 (eat an apple): Not possible right now — no apple at (7,6) or (6,7). I cannot eat an apple immediately.
- Option 2 (clean dirt): This is necessary. Cleaning dirt at (7,6) or (6,7) will eventually

--- Step 8 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 3). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision.

Currently, I am at (8, 3), and I see dirt at (7, 4). The distance to that dirt is only 2 steps — very close. This dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning, because apples only appear when the river is clean (i.e., when there's less dirt). 

Right now, there is no apple visible in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 steps away — far enough that it's not immediately accessible. Eating an apple now would give me +1.0 point, but there's no apple nearby to eat. So the immediate reward option is not viable.

Cleaning the dirt at (7, 4) will not give me a direct reward, but it is a prerequisite for future apple spawning. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, removing dirt enables apples to appear in the area. This helps the group (as per the rule that cleaning dirt helps the group), and eventually leads to more apples being available — which could lead to more points over time.

Given that:
- There is no apple currently available for me to eat,
- The dirt is very close (only
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 0). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I am at (7, 0). The nearest apple is at (1, 0), which is 6 units away — a significant distance. The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), which is only 4 units away. 

Let’s evaluate the options:

1. **Eating an apple for immediate reward**:  
   There are no apples visible nearby, and the nearest apple is far away (6 steps). Eating it would require a long journey and would only give +1.0 point. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), and we currently have dirt at (7, 4), there’s no guarantee that the apple at (1, 0) will be accessible or even present unless the dirt is cleaned. So, attempting to eat an apple now would be premature and likely futile — it might not spawn at all.

2. **Cleaning dirt to enable future apple spawning**:  
   The dirt at (7, 4) is within reach (only 4 steps away). Cleaning it would contribute to making the river clean, which increases the chance of apples spawning in the future — including potentially at (1, 0). This action has no immediate reward, but it’s essential
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 6). You see dirt at (6, 7).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to determine the best course of action.

Current position: (7, 6)  
Visible dirt: (6, 7)  
Nearest apple: (2, 5), distance = 6  
Nearest dirt: (7, 4), distance = 2  

Key observations:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately, which is a direct reward.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward but is necessary to enable future apple spawning — this supports long-term group goals.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), only 2 steps away (down 1, left 1), which is very close.
- The nearest apple is far away (6 steps), and there's no indication that apples are currently spawning due to the dirt.

Trade-off analysis:
1. **Eat an apple?**  
   - Immediate +1.0 reward.  
   - But the apple at (2,5) is far away, and the river is currently dirty (dirt at (7,4) and (6,7)), so apples likely won’t spawn anyway.

--- Step 9 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here’s the reasoning:

- There are no apples visible in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — far from where I currently am.
- The only dirt I can interact with is at (7, 4), just one step away. This is the closest dirt to me, and cleaning it will directly contribute to making the environment more favorable for apple spawning.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning that cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple generation. Even though cleaning gives no immediate reward, it enables future rewards (apples) for the group.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0, but there are no apples nearby, so that action would be futile. It would be a wasted action with no benefit.
- Moving to clean the dirt at (7, 4) is a low-cost, high-impact action that advances the long-term goal of enabling apple spawning. It is both necessary and efficient.
- Since I cannot move diagonally, I can only move up/down/left/right — and (7, 4) is directly above me, so it’s accessible in one move.

Therefore
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
   - The dirt is at (8, 3), which
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 3}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 6). You see dirt at (7, 6) and dirt at (6, 7).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 6), and the global scan shows that the nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 steps away — a significant distance. Right now, I see dirt at (7, 6) and (6, 7), and the nearest dirt is at distance 0. That means I'm standing on dirt, and cleaning it would be a logical first step.

Let’s analyze the trade-offs:

1. **Should I eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   No apples are immediately available at my current location. The nearest apple is far away (6 steps), and there's no indication that any apples are spawning due to clean land. Eating an apple would require movement and would be futile without first enabling apple spawning. Also, I have no apple in sight — so immediate consumption is not possible. Thus, this option is not viable.

2. **Should I clean dirt to ensure future apples spawn?**  
   Yes. The rule states that apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt). Currently, there is dirt at (7,6) and (6,7). Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning. Since apples are not spawning now, and the

--- Step 8 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 3). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here's the reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible in immediate range. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — far enough that it's not practical to reach it immediately.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 2 units away from my current position (8, 3), meaning it's very accessible.
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple spawns. Without cleaning, no apples will appear, even if I move toward them.
- Eating an apple now would give a +1.0 reward, but there are no apples nearby to eat. I cannot eat anything immediately — the nearest apple is out of reach, and there's no indication of any apple currently on the map that I can access.
- Cleaning dirt provides no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning — which directly supports the group's goal of maximizing points over time.
- Since I cannot move diagonally, I must move step-by-step. The path to (7, 4) is straightforward: move west to (7, 3), then north to (7, 4
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 0). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation based on the rules and current state.

I am currently at (7, 0). The nearest apple is at (1, 0), which is 6 units away — a significant distance. The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), just 4 units away vertically. 

Key facts:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed).
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward but enables future apple spawning.
- I cannot move diagonally — so movement is constrained to cardinal directions.

Now, consider the trade-offs:

1. **Eat an apple?**  
   The nearest apple is at (1, 0), which is 6 steps away. Since I can only move one step at a time (and no immediate reward from apples is mentioned beyond the point value), and there's no indication that apples are spawning or available now, I should consider whether any apple is actually available to eat *right now*. The global scan says "nearest apple at (1, 0)", but it doesn't say it's visible or accessible. Given that I see "nothing of interest nearby", and I'm at (7
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 6). You see dirt at (6, 7).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 6) and observe dirt at (6, 7). The global scan shows that the nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 units away — quite far. The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), only 2 units away. That means I am already relatively close to a dirt patch that I can clean.

Now, let's analyze the trade-offs:

1. **Eating an apple for immediate reward**:  
   There is no apple visible in immediate proximity. The nearest apple is at (2, 5), requiring a path through multiple tiles — likely involving crossing over dirt or other obstacles. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), and there is currently no apple visible at (7, 6), I cannot eat one now. Eating an apple would require first ensuring that an apple is present — which only happens after cleaning dirt. So, **no immediate apple is available** to eat.

2. **Cleaning dirt to enable future apple spawning**:  
   This is critical. Dirt blocks apple spawning. The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), just 2 units away — very close. Cleaning it will improve the river’s cleanliness

--- Step 9 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible in immediate range. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — far enough that immediate apple consumption would not be practical or efficient.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 unit away — very close and directly adjacent. This means cleaning it is a low-effort, high-impact action.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when there is less dirt). By removing this dirt, I am directly enabling future apple spawning — which benefits the group and increases the long-term availability of food.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 reward, but there are no apples nearby to consume. Even if one were available, the reward is immediate and short-term, while cleaning dirt provides a foundational action that enables future rewards.
- Since I cannot move diagonally, movement is constrained to cardinal directions. Moving from (7,3) to (7,4) to clean the dirt is a single, simple step — no risk or cost.

Therefore, the optimal decision is to clean the dirt at (7,4). This action supports the group's
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 1). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the trade-off between immediate reward and long-term benefit.

Currently, I'm at (7, 1). The nearest apple is at (2, 1), which is 5 units away — a significant distance. There's no visible apple in my immediate vicinity, and I see nothing of interest nearby in the current observation. That means eating an apple immediately isn't possible without moving.

The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), which is only 3 units away — very close. Cleaning dirt is necessary because apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when there's less dirt). So, cleaning dirt enables future apple spawning, which benefits the group. While cleaning itself gives no immediate reward, it's a prerequisite for apple generation.

Since I cannot move diagonally, I must follow a path that moves either up/down/left/right. From (7,1) to (7,4), I can go straight up: (7,1) → (7,2) → (7,3) → (7,4). This is a simple, efficient path with no obstacles mentioned.

There is no immediate apple available to eat, and the apple at (2,1) is too far away to be practical
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'

2. **Clean dirt to enable future
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 3}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 6). You see dirt at (7, 6) and dirt at (6, 7).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 6), which is currently covered in dirt. The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 steps away — quite distant. The nearest dirt is at (7, 6), meaning I’m already standing on it. There’s also dirt at (6, 7), which is one step away.

Let’s analyze the trade-offs:

1. **Should I eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There are no apples currently visible in my immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is 6 steps away, and I don’t know if it's accessible or if any apples have spawned yet. Apples only spawn when the river is clean — i.e., when dirt is removed. Since we’re currently at a dirt-covered location, and no apples are visible, there’s no apple available for immediate consumption. Therefore, eating an apple is not possible right now.

2. **Should I clean dirt to ensure future apples spawn (helping the group)?**  
   → Yes, absolutely. Dirt removal is essential for apple spawning. The current state of the environment (dirt at (7,6) and (6,7)) prevents apples from appearing. By cleaning dirt, I enable future apple spawns

--- Step 8 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 3). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully.

I am currently at (8, 3). The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), which is just one step away — a distance of 1 move. That means I can reach it in one turn. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — a significant distance.

Now, let’s evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward**:  
   There is no apple in immediate range. The nearest apple is 5 steps away. Eating it would require movement, and since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), I cannot eat an apple unless one is already present. Since there's no apple visible at my current position or nearby, I cannot eat one now. So this option is not viable.

2. **Clean the dirt at (7,4)**:  
   This is the only dirt visible in the global scan. Cleaning it would improve the river's cleanliness, which increases the chance of apples spawning in the future. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, this is a necessary step to enable future apple growth. Even though cleaning gives no immediate reward, it enables long-term gains
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 0). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to make the best decision.

Current position: (7, 0)  
Nearest apple: (1, 0) — distance 6 units (6 steps to reach)  
Nearest dirt: (7, 4) — distance 4 units (4 steps to reach)  

Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apples to appear.  
Currently, there are apples available, so they are already spawning — but they may be temporary or dependent on the river being clean.  

Key trade-off:  
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediate reward.  
- Cleaning dirt has no immediate reward but enables future apple spawning (benefits the group).  

But here's the critical point:  
There is an apple at (1, 0) — which is currently visible and reachable. That means apples *are* spawning now. So, if the river is not clean, apples might not spawn at all. Since apples *are* present, the river must currently be clean — or at least, the dirt has been cleaned recently.  

However, the nearest dirt is at (7, 4), which is only 4 steps away. If I go there
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 6). You see dirt at (6, 7).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully.

I am at position (7, 6). There's dirt at (6, 7), which is just one step away — a very short distance. The nearest dirt globally is at (7, 4), which is 3 steps away (down 3 units), so (6, 7) is actually closer than the global nearest dirt. This means there's accessible dirt nearby that I can clean immediately.

The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 steps away — quite far. There are no apples visible in the immediate vicinity, and since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), I currently have no apples available to eat.

Now, evaluating the options:

1. **Eat an apple** — There is no apple at my current position or nearby. The nearest apple is 6 steps away and not currently spawnable because the river is dirty. Eating an apple is not possible right now. So this option is invalid.

2. **Clean dirt** — I can clean the dirt at (6, 7) in one move. This action will reduce the dirt count in the environment, which improves the river's cleanliness. As a result

--- Step 9 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here’s the reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — quite far and not accessible without first improving the environment.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is very close — just one step away — and it's the nearest dirt patch. This means cleaning it would have a direct, low-effort impact on enabling future apple spawning.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is reduced). Cleaning dirt does not give immediate reward, but it is a necessary prerequisite for apples to appear. Without cleaning, no apples can spawn, regardless of how far they are.
- Eating an apple now would be impossible, since there are no apples in the current field of view or nearby. Even if we could reach (12, 2), it's far and would require clearing more dirt first — making it inefficient to prioritize eating now.
- The trade-off is between immediate reward (which is zero here) and long-term benefit (enabling future apple spawns). Since no apples are available now, and the dirt is nearby and directly actionable, cleaning it is
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 1). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the trade-off between immediate reward and long-term benefits.

Currently, I am at (7, 1). The nearest apple is at (2, 1), which is 5 units away — a significant distance. Since I can't move diagonally, I would need to move left along row 1 to reach it. However, the nearest dirt is at (7, 4), only 3 units away (down 3 units). Cleaning dirt is essential because apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning that without cleaning dirt, no apples will appear, regardless of how far I go.

Right now, there are no visible apples nearby, and I’m at a position far from the nearest apple. If I choose to eat an apple immediately, I would have to travel to (2,1), which is 5 steps away — and even if I could reach it, there’s no guarantee that an apple is actually there. But more importantly, if the river remains dirty (dirt at (7,4) uncleaned), apples will not spawn at all in the future, which undermines the entire goal of the game — maximizing points through apple collection.

Moreover, cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it enables future apple
   - So, the apple might exist *now*, regardless of dirt
  Decision: {'action': 'move_to', 'args': {'coord_x': 5, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 6). You see dirt at (7, 6) and dirt at (6, 7).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 6), where there is dirt. The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 steps away. There is also dirt at (6, 7), which is one step away from my current position.

Let’s analyze the trade-offs:

1. **Should I eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple at (7, 6) or (6, 7). The nearest apple is far away (6 steps), and I cannot eat it without moving. Eating an apple requires being on land with an apple. Since no apple is currently visible or reachable in one step, I cannot eat one immediately. Therefore, this option is not viable at this moment.

2. **Should I clean dirt to ensure future apples spawn?**  
   Yes — this is the only actionable step available now. Dirt must be cleaned to allow apples to spawn. The current dirt at (7, 6) and (6, 7) are blocking apple generation. Cleaning them will eventually enable apples to appear in the area, especially since the nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is on the far side of the map. The river being clean (i.e., less dirt)

--- Step 8 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 3). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to determine the best course of action.

Currently, I am at (8, 3). The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), which is only 1 step away (distance 1, not 2 as listed in the global scan — likely a typo). That means I can reach the dirt quickly. Cleaning dirt is essential because apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt removal enables future apple spawning. While cleaning gives no immediate reward, it's a prerequisite for earning apples later.

The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 steps away. That’s a significant distance. If I try to eat an apple now, I’d have to move to (12, 2) — but there’s no apple visible or mentioned at my current location (8, 3). I don’t see any apple nearby. So, eating an apple immediately isn’t possible.

Therefore, option 1 (eating an apple now) is not feasible — no apple is visible or reachable in a single move.

Option 2 (cleaning dirt) is both necessary and urgent. The dirt at (7, 4) is very close — just one step left from (8,
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (5, 0). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to determine the best course of action.

Currently, I am at (5, 0). The nearest apple is at (1, 0), which is 4 units away — a relatively short distance. Eating that apple would give me an immediate +1.0 reward. However, the key constraint is that apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple spawns. 

The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), which is 6 units away. That means I would have to move to clean it, which would require a journey of 6 steps — longer than the 4-step path to the apple. But cleaning dirt doesn't give any immediate reward; it only enables future apple spawns. 

Now, weighing the options:

1. **Eat the apple at (1, 0)**: This gives immediate +1.0 reward. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and we don’t currently have clean water, this apple might be a rare opportunity — possibly the only one available in the current state. If we don’t act now, future apple spawns may not occur at all. So, eating it now could be a strategic move to secure
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 1, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 6). You see dirt at (6, 7).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully and decide the best course of action based on the rules and current state.

Current position: (7, 6)  
Visible dirt: (6, 7)  
Nearest apple: (2, 5), distance = 6  
Nearest dirt: (7, 4), distance = 2  

Key facts:
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Clean river = more apples.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward but enables future apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.
- Movement is only allowed in cardinal directions (up, down, left, right), no diagonals.

Now, evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple?**  
   The nearest apple is at (2,5), which is 6 steps away. That’s a long distance. Given that we’re at (7,6), we’d need to move left and up to reach it. However, there’s no indication that apples are currently spawning — they only spawn when the river is clean. Since we have dirt at (7,4), and the nearest dirt is only 2 steps away, the river is not clean. Thus, no apples are currently available

--- Step 9 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here's the reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible nearby (the nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 steps away), and there's no immediate apple spawn at (7, 3) or adjacent tiles.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 step away — very close and directly accessible.
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Since dirt is blocking apple spawning, cleaning it is a prerequisite for future apple generation.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 point, but there are no apples in immediate reach. The apple at (12, 2) is far away and will not spawn unless the river is clean — meaning we must first clean dirt to enable it.
- Cleaning dirt provides no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning, which directly supports the group's long-term goal.
- Since we are at (7, 3) and dirt is at (7, 4), moving to (7, 4) is a simple, low-risk action that directly advances the condition for apple spawning.
- Without cleaning this dirt, we cannot get apples anywhere — even if we

Moving from (4, 0) towards (2, 1).
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (4, 0). You see an apple at (2, 1).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (2, 1).

Reasoning:

- The apple at (2, 1) is within immediate reach — just one step east from (4, 0) to (3, 0), then north to (3, 1), then west to (2, 1). This is a very short path (3 moves: (4,0) → (3,0) → (2,0) → (2,1)) — just 3 steps, which is minimal effort.
- The nearest apple globally is at (1,0), which is 3 units away — same distance as the apple at (2,1), but the path to (1,0) would require going west and then north/south, which is slightly longer and less direct.
- The nearest dirt is at (7,4), which is 7 units away — far beyond any immediate benefit. Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward and would require significant effort with no guaranteed return unless apples spawn later. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and we don’t have confirmation that cleaning dirt will lead to apple spawning, it’s a long-term, uncertain investment.
- The immediate reward of +1.0 for eating
  Decision: {'action': 'move_to', 'args': {'coord_x': 2, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 6). You see dirt at (6, 7).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 7).

Reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away — quite far and not immediately accessible.
- The nearest dirt is at (6, 7), just one step away. Cleaning it will improve the river's cleanliness, which increases the chance of apples spawning in the future.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — so cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple availability.
- Eating an apple now would give a +1.0 immediate reward, but since no apples are currently spawning (due to dirt), that action would be futile — it's like eating a non-existent fruit.
- The current dirt at (6, 7) is directly adjacent, so cleaning it is a low-effort, high-impact action that enables future apple generation.
- Since the goal is to maximize points over time (not just immediate gain), prioritizing environmental improvement aligns with long-term success.
- There is no immediate danger or obstacle — just a simple, actionable step to improve the environment.

   Dirt must be cleaned to allow apples to spawn. The nearest dirt is
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 3}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 6). You see dirt at (7, 6) and dirt at (6, 7).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 6), where there is dirt. I also see dirt at (6, 7). The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 steps away. There is no apple currently visible in my immediate vicinity — I am standing on dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed).

Let’s analyze the trade-off:

1. **Should I eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → No. There is no apple at (7, 6) or (6, 7). I cannot eat an apple unless one is present. The nearest apple is 6 steps away, and it is not currently visible or accessible without first cleaning the dirt. Eating an apple would require being on land with an apple, which is not the case here. So, immediate reward is not available.

2. **Should I clean dirt to ensure future apples spawn (helping the group)?**  
   → Yes. This is the logical and necessary step. Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning when dirt is removed. The current state has dirt at (7, 6) and (6, 7), which prevents apple spawning. Cleaning this dirt

--- Step 8 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 3). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am currently at (8, 3). The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), which is only 1 step away (distance 2 — one move to (7,3), then to (7,4)). This dirt is very close and directly adjacent to my current position. Cleaning this dirt would contribute to making the river cleaner, which in turn increases the chance of apples spawning in the future — especially since the nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away and likely requires a clean river path to be accessible.

Currently, there are no apples visible in my immediate vicinity. The only apple is far away at (12, 2), and it's only possible to access it if the river is clean and apples are allowed to spawn. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple spawning.

Eating an apple now would give +1.0 immediately, but there are no apples nearby — I cannot eat one at this moment. So the option of "eating an apple" is not viable.

Option 2 — cleaning dirt — is both immediate and necessary. By cleaning the dirt at (

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 0). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully.

Currently, I am at (7, 0). The nearest apple is at (1, 0), which is 6 units away — a significant distance. The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), only 4 units away. Since I cannot move diagonally, I would need to move in straight lines (horizontal or vertical).

Key points:
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately — a clear reward.
- However, apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed). So, if I don't clean dirt, apples won't appear at all — even if I'm close to one.
- The current apple at (1, 0) might be temporary or not sustainable — if the river is dirty, it might not stay there.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 4 units away, which is manageable — I can reach it in 4 moves (up to (7,4)) and clean it.
- Cleaning dirt has no immediate reward, but enables future apple spawning — which benefits the group and increases long-term points.
- If I eat the apple at (1,0), I get a point, but if the

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 6). You see dirt at (6, 7).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 7), not eat an apple.

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 units away — a significant distance. Given that apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when there is less dirt), and that cleaning dirt enables future apple spawning, I cannot reliably access that apple without first improving the environment.
- The dirt at (6, 7) is adjacent to my current position (7, 6), so it's within one move. This means I can clean it immediately with a low-effort action.
- Cleaning dirt doesn't give immediate reward, but it is essential for enabling future apple spawning. Since apples are the only source of points, and they are not guaranteed to spawn without clean conditions, investing in cleaning now increases the probability of future apple spawns.
- The nearest dirt globally is at (7, 4), which is 2 units away — but that's farther from me than (6, 7), which is just one step away. So (6, 7) is the most accessible dirt.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0, but if I do so, I'm ignoring the opportunity

--- Step 9 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: Given the current situation, I need to carefully analyze the trade-offs between immediate reward and long-term benefit.

I am currently at (7, 3), and there is dirt at (7, 4) — just one step away. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 steps away. There are no apples visible in the immediate vicinity. The dirt at (7, 4) is the closest dirt patch, and cleaning it would contribute to making the river cleaner, which increases the chance of apples spawning in the future.

Key points:
- **Immediate reward**: Eating an apple gives +1.0 point, but there are no apples nearby. The nearest apple is 6 steps away, and there's no indication of any apple currently spawning due to clean conditions.
- **Future benefit**: Cleaning dirt (even if it gives no immediate reward) is essential to enable apple spawning. Without cleaning, apples won’t appear — meaning no reward at all in the future.
- **Current state**: The river is not clean (dirt exists), so apples are not spawning. Cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apples to appear.

Therefore, **eating an apple now is not viable** — there is no apple in reach.

**Cleaning the

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 1). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am currently at (7, 1). The nearest apple is at (2, 1), which is 5 units away — a significant distance. However, there is no apple visible nearby, and I see nothing of interest in the immediate vicinity. This suggests that the apple at (2, 1) is not currently accessible or visible, and I may not be able to reach it without first improving the environment.

The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), which is only 3 units away — very close. Cleaning dirt is not directly rewarding, but it is essential for enabling apple spawning. The rule states that apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt). So, if we clean dirt, it increases the chance of apples appearing on land, which benefits the group in the long term.

Currently, there are no apples visible, and the apple at (2, 1) is far away. If I go to clean the dirt at (7, 4), I will be taking a step toward making the environment more favorable for apple spawning. This could eventually allow apples to appear in more locations, including possibly near (2, 1
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 6). You see dirt at (6, 7).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 7).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away. To reach it, I’d need to move through several tiles — likely passing through or near dirt tiles. However, apples only spawn when the river is clean, meaning that dirt must be removed to enable apple growth. Since there is currently dirt at (6, 7), and that’s the nearest dirt, it's a critical bottleneck.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 point, but only if an apple is present and accessible. However, the apple at (2, 5) is not spawning because the river (or environment) is currently dirty — so it's likely not active or visible due to the dirt condition. Without cleaning dirt, apples won’t spawn, regardless of distance.
- Cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple spawning. Even though it gives no immediate reward, it enables the system to generate apples in the long run. This supports the group’s goal of maximizing total points over time.
   There is no apple in immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is 5 steps away, and there is no indication that it's currently available or visible. Eating it would require a long journey and no reward unless the apple is

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 6). You see dirt at (7, 6) and dirt at (6, 7).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 6), which is currently covered in dirt, and I also see dirt at (6, 7). The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 steps away — quite distant. Right now, there are no apples visible in my immediate vicinity, and the river is not clean (since there is dirt present), meaning apples cannot spawn.

Let’s break down the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward**  
   → There is no apple at (7, 6) or (6, 7). I cannot eat an apple immediately. The nearest apple is far away, and without cleaning dirt, apples won't spawn at all. So, this option is not viable right now.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning**  
   → This is essential. Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed). Since we are currently at a dirt-covered location, cleaning it is a prerequisite for future apple generation. This action has no immediate reward, but it enables long-term gains.  
   → The dirt at (7, 6) is directly adjacent to me — I can clean it immediately. Cleaning it will reduce dirt in the area

--- Step 8 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 3). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — far from my current position at (8, 3). There are no nearby apples (within 1–2 units) that I can immediately access, so eating an apple now would not provide a meaningful immediate reward and would miss the opportunity to gain access to future apples.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 2 units away — very close and strategically important. Dirt cleaning is not directly rewarding, but it enables apple spawning when the river becomes clean. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, removing dirt is a prerequisite for future apple generation.
- By cleaning this dirt, I’m investing in a long-term benefit: enabling future apple spawns in the area. This supports the group’s overall goal of maximizing apple collection.
- Moving diagonally is not allowed, so I must move in cardinal directions (up, down, left, right). From (8,3), I can move to (7,3) or (9,3) or (8,2) or (8,4). The dirt is at (7,4), so I
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 0). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I am at (7, 0). The nearest apple is at (1, 0), which is 6 units away — a long distance. The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), which is only 4 units away, meaning I can reach it in a straightforward vertical path (moving up to (7, 4)).

Right now, I see nothing of interest nearby, and there are no visible apples or dirt in the immediate vicinity. This suggests that the current state of the environment is not yet conducive to apple spawning — apples only appear when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed). Since dirt at (7, 4) is the nearest, cleaning it would make apples more likely to spawn in the future, possibly at (1, 0) or nearby.

Now, analyzing the trade-offs:

1. **Eating an apple immediately** — There are no apples visible at (7, 0) or nearby. The nearest apple is 6 units away, and there's no indication that it's accessible or visible. Eating it would require moving to (1, 0), which is inefficient and far. Also, since apples only spawn when the river is clean, if the dirt remains, the apple may

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 6). You see dirt at (6, 7).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am currently at (7, 6). I see dirt at (6, 7), which is just one step away — a very short distance. The nearest dirt globally is at (7, 4), which is 3 steps away (down 3 units). That means there's dirt nearby, and cleaning it would contribute to making the river cleaner, which in turn increases the chance of apples spawning.

Currently, there is an apple at (2, 5), which is 6 steps away — quite distant. Eating that apple would give me +1.0 immediately, but it's not accessible without first potentially cleaning dirt to improve the environment for future apple spawning.

Now, consider the trade-off:

- **Immediate reward**: Eating an apple gives +1.0, but it's far away and requires moving through potentially dirty terrain. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and clean river = more apples, the immediate apple might not be available unless the environment is already clean. The presence of dirt at (6,7) and (7,4) suggests the river is currently dirty — so apples may not be spawning at all.

- **Future reward**: Cleaning dirt

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible or nearby in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — quite far and not accessible without first improving the environment.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 unit away from my current position (7, 3), making it the closest and most accessible dirt patch.
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple spawning. Without cleaning, even if apples exist elsewhere, they won't appear.
- Eating an apple now would give a +1.0 reward, but there are no apples available in the current environment. The apple at (12, 2) is not accessible until the river is clean, and even then, it might not spawn until dirt is removed.
- Since I cannot move diagonally, I must move step-by-step. The only logical and efficient first move is to clean the dirt at (7, 4), which is adjacent and directly reachable.
- Cleaning dirt provides no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning — which is essential for long-term point accumulation and group

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 1). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to make the best decision.

Current position: (7, 1)  
Nearest apple: (2, 1) — distance 5  
Nearest dirt: (7, 4) — distance 3  

Key facts:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned).
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward but enables future apple spawning.
- Movement is only allowed in cardinal directions (up, down, left, right).
- The goal is to maximize points — immediate and long-term.

Let’s evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple at (2, 1)**  
   - Distance is 5 — this requires moving 5 steps to reach.  
   - If I eat it now, I get +1.0 immediately.  
   - However, if I don’t clean dirt, apples won’t spawn in the future.  
   - The apple at (2,1) may not be the only one — future apples depend on cleaning dirt.  
   - Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and the nearest dirt is at (7,4), cleaning it will allow

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 6). You see dirt at (6, 7).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 7).

Here's the reasoning:

- There is currently no apple nearby (the nearest is at (2, 5), 5 units away), and we are at (6, 6), so we can't reach it directly without first cleaning dirt.
- The dirt at (6, 7) is only 1 step away — a very short and low-effort action.
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Since we are currently on land (at (6, 6)), and there is dirt adjacent to us, the river is not clean — thus, no apples are spawning.
- Cleaning this dirt will improve the environment, enabling future apple spawning. This is a critical prerequisite for earning apples.
- Eating an apple now is not feasible because no apple is within reach, and the nearest one is too far away to be practical in the current state.
- The immediate reward of eating an apple is zero in this situation — we can't access one without first cleaning dirt and possibly expanding our reachable area.
- Cleaning dirt is a necessary foundational step. Without it, future apple spawning is blocked.

   Cleaning dirt has no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning. The dirt is 5 units away — a reasonable distance to

I am currently at (7, 6), which is both a dirt location and the nearest dirt globally (distance 0). There is also dirt at (6, 7). The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 steps away — a significant distance. 

Key facts:
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when there's no dirt).
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward but enables future apple spawning.
- I can only move in cardinal directions (up, down, left, right), not diagonally.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.

Right now, I am standing on dirt. That means I cannot eat an apple at (7, 6) because it's not land. The only apple available is at (2, 5), which is far away and currently not accessible without first clearing dirt in the path.

But here's the critical insight: **I cannot spawn apples unless the river (or land) is clean**. Since I'm currently on dirt, and there's dirt at (6,7), I must first clean dirt to make land available for apples to spawn.

--- Step 8 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 3). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully.

Currently, I am at (8, 3), and I see dirt at (7, 4). The distance to that dirt is only 2 steps — very close. This means I can reach it quickly. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 steps away — farther than the dirt.

Key point: Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. So, cleaning dirt is not just a maintenance task — it's a prerequisite for future apple spawning. Without cleaning dirt, apples won’t appear, and I (and the group) will miss out on rewards.

Right now, there are no apples visible in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is 5 steps away, and there's no indication that it's currently spawnable — it likely requires the river to be clean first. Therefore, eating an apple now would give me +1.0, but it would be a wasted opportunity because the apple isn't spawning due to dirt.

Cleaning the dirt at (7,4) will:
- Make the environment more conducive to apple spawning in the future
- Enable the group to eventually access apples (like the one at (12,2)) when they become available
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 0). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision for maximizing points and contributing to the group's success.

Currently, I am at (7, 0). The nearest apple is at (1, 0), which is 6 units away — a long distance. There's no visible apple in sight, and I see nothing of interest nearby. That means eating an apple immediately is not feasible — I can't reach it without moving, and there's no apple in range.

The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), which is only 4 units away — directly above me. Cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apples to spawn. The global scan shows that apples only appear when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt). So, if I clean the dirt at (7,4), I enable future apple spawning — which is critical for long-term point accumulation.

Even though cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, it is essential for enabling future apple spawns. Since apples are currently not spawning (no visible ones), the system is likely in a "cleaning required" state. Without cleaning, apples won’t appear, and the group will be unable to earn points.

Additionally, the apple at (1,0) is far away and would require a
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 6). You see dirt at (6, 7).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am currently at (7, 6). The observation shows dirt at (6, 7), which is just one step away. The global scan indicates that the nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 steps away — quite distant. The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), which is only 2 steps away from my current position (7,6). That means I can reach the dirt at (7,4) in just two moves: down to (7,5), then to (7,4).

Now, evaluating the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple visible in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (2,5), which is 6 steps away. To reach it, I’d have to move left and up, which requires clearing the path — but there's no indication that the river is currently clean enough for apples to spawn. In fact, apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed). Since we currently have dirt present, apples are not spawning. Therefore, eating an apple is not possible right now — it's not even

--- Step 9 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here's my reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away. That means I would need to travel through several tiles to reach it. However, there is currently dirt at (7, 4), just one tile away from my current position (7, 3). 
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned before apples can appear. Since there is dirt immediately adjacent to me, and no apples are currently visible nearby, I cannot eat an apple right now.
- Eating an apple is only possible when apples are already present on land. There is no apple visible at (7, 4) or any nearby tile. So option 1 (eating an apple) is not viable.
- Option 2 (cleaning dirt) is essential for enabling future apple spawning. By cleaning the dirt at (7, 4), I make land available for apples to spawn later. This supports the group's long-term goal of maximizing apple collection.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it is a necessary precondition for future apple growth. Since no apples are currently available and the dirt is very close, acting

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 1). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4), even though there's no immediate reward.

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 1), which is 5 units away. That's a long distance, and there's no indication of any apples spawning nearby currently. Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning the dirt must be cleaned first.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), just 3 units away from my current position (7,1). This is a very accessible target.
- Cleaning dirt does not give immediate points, but it is a prerequisite for apples to spawn. Without cleaning dirt, no apples can appear — so this action enables future apple spawns, which are essential for maximizing points over time.
- There's no immediate apple in sight, and the apple at (2,1) is far away and likely won't spawn unless the river is clean. Therefore, attempting to eat it now would be futile and miss the opportunity to enable future rewards.
- Since I cannot move diagonally, I can move directly from (7,1) to (7,4) in 3 steps (down 3 units), which is efficient and safe.

By cleaning the dirt, I'm

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 6). You see dirt at (6, 7).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 7).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away. That means it's not immediately accessible — I’d have to move through multiple steps to reach it, and even then, I’d need to ensure the river is clean to have apples spawn in the first place.
- The dirt at (6, 7) is only 1 unit away — very close. Cleaning it will improve the river's cleanliness, which directly enables future apple spawning. This is a necessary precondition for apples to appear in the environment.
- Eating an apple now would give me +1.0 immediately, but there are no apples currently visible nearby. More importantly, apples only spawn *when the river is clean*, so if I don’t clean the dirt, no apples will appear — even if I move to (2, 5), I won’t find one.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it is essential for long-term apple availability. Since the goal is to maximize points *over time*, and apples are the only source of points, enabling their spawning is more valuable than a short-term gain of 1.0.
- The global scan shows that the

--- Step 10 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 4). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 4), which is currently covered in dirt. The nearest apple is at (2, 5), 6 units away — quite far. There is no dirt nearby except at my current position, and the global scan confirms that dirt is the only obstacle preventing apple spawning.

Let’s analyze the trade-offs:

1. **Should I eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   — There is no apple at (7, 4). The only apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 steps away. I cannot eat an apple immediately because I'm standing on dirt. Eating apples requires being on land, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed). Since there are no apples currently available at my position, I cannot gain points immediately. So, eating an apple is not possible right now.

2. **Should I clean dirt to ensure future apples spawn?**  
   — Yes. Dirt prevents apple spawning. By cleaning the dirt at (7, 4), I enable the potential for apples to spawn in that area or nearby in the future. Since apples only appear when the river is clean, removing dirt is a prerequisite for any apple generation. Even though cleaning gives no
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (3, 0). You see an apple at (1, 0) and an apple at (2, 1).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Reasoning:

- The apple at (1, 0) is immediately accessible and only 2 steps away — a very short distance. This gives me an immediate +1.0 point reward with minimal cost.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), which is 8 units away. Cleaning that dirt would require significant movement and time, and there is no immediate benefit from doing so — apples only spawn when the river is clean, which is a long-term, indirect benefit.
- There are currently no apples nearby that are within reach of the dirt cleaning path. The apple at (2, 1) is farther (distance ≈ √5 ≈ 2.2), but still not as close as (1, 0) and not directly tied to any immediate dirt-cleaning action.
- Since the goal is to maximize points, and eating an apple gives a direct, immediate reward, while cleaning dirt offers no immediate benefit and requires significant effort, the optimal decision is to consume the nearest apple.
- There is no indication that cleaning dirt is necessary or imminent — apples are already present and accessible. Therefore, acting on immediate opportunity is rational.

Conclusion: Eat the apple at (
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 1, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 7). You see dirt at (6, 7), dirt at (6, 8) and dirt at (7, 8).
  Thinking: I am at (6, 7), and the current observation shows that there is dirt at (6, 7), (6, 8), and (7, 8). The global scan confirms that the nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 steps away — quite far. There is no apple currently visible in the immediate vicinity, and the only dirt present is at these three locations.

Now, let’s analyze the trade-offs:

1. **Should I eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There is no apple currently visible at my position or nearby. The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 steps away, and we have no indication of any apple spawning in the current environment. Eating an apple would require movement to reach it, and there are no apples on land now because the river is not clean (dirt is present). Therefore, **I cannot eat an apple immediately**. Attempting to eat one now would be futile and unproductive.

2. **Should I clean dirt to ensure future apples spawn (helping the group)?**  
   → Yes. The rule states that apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when there is less dirt

--- Step 11 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 4). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to make the best decision given the constraints and goals.

Current position: (7, 4)  
Nearest apple: (2, 5) — distance = 6 steps  
Nearest dirt: (7, 8) — distance = 4 steps  

Key facts:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned).
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but enables future apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.
- Movement is only allowed in cardinal directions (up, down, left, right) — no diagonals.
- The goal is to maximize points, which comes from eating apples, but apples only appear when the river is clean.

Now, the trade-off:

Option 1: Eat an apple immediately  
- The nearest apple is at (2,5), which is 6 steps away.  
- Since we are at (7,4), we would need to move to (2,5) — a long path.  
- But there's no apple visible nearby, and no indication that one is currently spawnable.  
- If we don’t clean the dirt, no apples will spawn — so eating an apple now
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 8}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 0). You see an apple at (1, 0) and an apple at (2, 1).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Here's the reasoning:

- I am currently at (2, 0), and there is an apple directly adjacent at (1, 0) — just one step away. This is a direct, immediate opportunity to gain +1.0 point with no risk or cost.
- The nearest dirt is at (6, 8), which is 12 steps away. Cleaning that dirt would require significant movement and time, and since apples only spawn when the river is clean, it's a future benefit that cannot be realized immediately.
- There is another apple at (2, 1), which is one step up from me — also within reach. However, I have a choice: eat one apple now, or go to (2, 1) and eat that one. Both are equally close and offer the same immediate reward.
- Since the goal is to *maximize points*, and eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately, while cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward and only enables future apple spawning, the immediate action is more beneficial.
- There is no indication that cleaning dirt is urgent or that future apple spawns are critical in the short term. Without a clear need for long-term strategy (e
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away — quite far. Eating it would give a +1.0 reward, but it's not immediately accessible or likely to be the only apple available in the long term.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 unit away — very close. Cleaning it is a low-effort, high-impact action that directly improves the environment.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when there is less dirt). By cleaning this dirt, I am enabling future apple spawning, which benefits the group and increases long-term rewards.
- There is no immediate benefit to eating the apple now — it's far away and would require a long path, during which I might miss opportunities to clean dirt and enable more apples.
- Since I cannot move diagonally, my movement is constrained, so efficiency matters. Cleaning nearby dirt (only one step away) is both feasible and strategic.

Thus, cleaning the dirt at (7, 4) is the optimal choice: it supports future apple spawning, aligns with the group's goal, and uses minimal effort. Eating an

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to determine the best course of action.

Current position: (7, 3)  
Agent 2 is at (7, 2) — directly above me.  
There is dirt at (7, 4) — directly to my right.  
The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away.  
The nearest dirt is only 1 unit away — at (7, 4).

Key facts:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned).
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward but enables future apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.
- I cannot move diagonally — so movement is restricted to cardinal directions.

Now, the trade-off:

Option 1: Eat an apple immediately  
- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 steps away.  
- I am currently at (7, 3). To reach (12, 2), I’d need to go right 5 and down 1 (or up/down depending on path), so minimum 6 steps.  
- There’s no apple visible or nearby. The apple at (12

  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the current situation to determine the best course of action.

Current position: (7, 2)  
Agent 1 is at (7, 3) — directly above me, so we're in the same column.  
Nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away (same row, moving right).  
Nearest dirt is at (7, 4), which is just one step above me — distance = 2.

Key observations:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean. Dirt removal is necessary but doesn't give immediate reward.
- The apple at (12, 2) is far away — 5 steps to reach. That means I’d have to walk to it, and if I don’t clean dirt first, no apples will spawn at all.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is very close — only 2 steps away. Cleaning it would make apples potentially spawn in the future, especially since the apple is at (12, 2), which is on the same row (row 2), suggesting that row 2 might be a key area for apple spawning.
- There's no immediate apple nearby (within 1 step). The

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here's why:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away. That means it's not immediately accessible, and there's no apple in immediate proximity.
- The only dirt visible is at (7, 4), just one step away. This is a critical resource because apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be removed to enable apple spawning.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 point, but there's no apple nearby to eat. The apple at (2, 5) is far away and would require a path to be cleared or made accessible, which currently isn't possible.
- Cleaning dirt has no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning. Since apples are the only source of points and they are currently not spawning due to dirt, cleaning is a necessary prerequisite for long-term gains.
- There's no immediate alternative action — moving diagonally is not allowed, and no other dirt or apples are visible in the scan.

Therefore, the trade-off favors cleaning the dirt at (7, 4). It's a strategic, long-term investment that enables future apple spawns and allows the group to eventually earn points

  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here's my reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — quite far. There are no apples visible nearby, and the only dirt is at (7, 4), just one step away.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 point, but there are no apples in immediate range. The apple at (12, 2) is not accessible without first cleaning the dirt that blocks the path or prevents apple spawning.
- The rule states: apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt). This means that cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apples to appear — not just for spawning, but for enabling them to exist at all.
- Since dirt is present at (7, 4), and it's only one step away, cleaning it is a low-effort, high-impact action that enables future apple spawning. This directly supports the group's long-term goal.
- Moving diagonally is not allowed, so movement is restricted to cardinal directions. From (7, 3), I can move to (7, 4) to clean it — a simple, feasible action.
- There is

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the trade-off between immediate reward and long-term benefit.

Currently, I am at (7, 2), and I see Agent 1 at (7, 3) — they are directly adjacent, so there's potential for coordination or competition. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — that’s a considerable distance. The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), only 2 units away. Cleaning that dirt would make apples spawn on land, which is essential for future apple availability.

Key considerations:

- Eating an apple now would give me +1.0 point immediately, but the apple at (12, 2) is far away. I would need to walk to it, and there’s no indication of other nearby apples. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, if I don’t clean the dirt at (7,4), future apple spawning is blocked — meaning I (and others) may never get apples again.

- The dirt at (7,4) is only 2 steps away from me — a very short path. Cleaning it would enable future apple spawning, which benefits the entire group. This is a strategic, long-term investment with no immediate reward,

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here’s the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away — far from my current position at (7, 5). Eating it would require a long path and likely would not be efficient, especially since apples only spawn when the river is clean. That means apples are not guaranteed to be available even if I eat one now.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 unit away — extremely close. Cleaning it is a low-effort, high-impact action that directly improves the environment for future apple spawning.
- The rule states that apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (less dirt). So, by cleaning this dirt, I’m enabling future apple spawns — which benefits the group and increases the long-term availability of food.
- There is no immediate reward for eating an apple here (since it’s far away and not currently spawning), and no nearby apple is visible. Therefore, consuming one now would be a waste of time and movement.
  Obs: You are at (7, 1). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to determine the best course of action.

Currently, I am at position (7, 1). The nearest apple is at (2, 1), which is 5 units away — a significant distance. Eating that apple would give me +1.0 point immediately, but I must consider whether that’s the most efficient or strategic move.

The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), which is only 3 units away. Cleaning dirt is essential because apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when there's less dirt). This means that cleaning dirt enables future apple spawning — a long-term benefit for the group. However, cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, so it's a trade-off between immediate gain and future potential.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple at (2, 1)**:  
   - Immediate +1.0 point.  
   - But the apple is 5 steps away — I’d need to move there.  
   - There’s no indication that apples will spawn elsewhere in the near future, and since I’m already at (7,1), moving to (2,1) would require traversing a long path.  
   -

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: Given the current situation, I must analyze the trade-off carefully.

I am at (7, 5), and I see dirt at (7, 4) — just one step away. The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 steps away. That means I cannot reach it directly without first cleaning the dirt. However, the key rule is: **apples only spawn on land when the river is clean**. This implies that cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apples to appear — not just a side benefit.

Right now, there is dirt at (7, 4), which blocks the river's cleanliness at that point. Since apples require a clean river to spawn, cleaning this dirt would improve the environmental conditions for future apple spawning. Even though there's no immediate reward for cleaning, it enables future rewards (apples) to appear.

Eating an apple now would give me +1.0 immediately, but:
- The apple at (2, 5) is far away (distance 5).
- I don’t have a path to it without first cleaning or navigating around the dirt.

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision for maximizing points and contributing to the group's success.

Current position: (7, 3)  
Agent 2 is at (7, 2) — directly above me.  
Dirt is at (7, 4) — directly to my right.  
Nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 steps away.  
The nearest dirt is only 1 step away — very accessible.

Key rules:
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned).
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but enables future apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.
- You cannot move diagonally.

Now, the trade-off:

1. **Eat an apple now?**  
   The nearest apple is 6 steps away. There are no apples visible nearby — the closest apple is far off. Eating an apple would require moving to (12, 2), which is a long journey. There’s no apple at (7, 3) or (7, 2) or (7, 4). So, no immediate apple is available to eat.  
   →
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4), even though it doesn't give immediate reward.

Reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — a significant distance. There are no apples visible in the immediate vicinity (within 1-2 steps), and the current state of the environment suggests apples only spawn when the river is clean.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 2 steps away — very close and accessible. Cleaning it would directly contribute to making the river clean, which is a prerequisite for apples to spawn in the future.
- Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, cleaning dirt is not just beneficial — it's a prerequisite for apple availability. Without cleaning, no apples will appear, regardless of how far they might be.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 reward, but if the river remains dirty, future apples (including the one at (12, 2)) will not spawn. That means the apple at (12, 2) might never become available, and the group's long-term goal is undermined.
- Agent 1 is at (7, 3), just one step above me. There's
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Reasoning:

- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Right now, there is dirt at (7, 4), which is blocking apple spawning in that area. Even though the nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away, it's currently not possible to spawn apples unless dirt is removed.
- Eating an apple immediately gives +1.0, but without cleaning dirt, future apple spawns are blocked. Since apples are the only source of points, and they are conditional on a clean river, the long-term sustainability of earning points depends on cleaning dirt.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only one step away — directly above me at (7, 4). This is a minimal effort to make a significant long-term impact.
- There is no immediate apple nearby that can be eaten without first ensuring the environment supports future apple growth. Even if I eat an apple now, if dirt remains, future apple spawning will be limited.
- Cleaning this dirt will improve the overall ecosystem, enabling future apple spawns — which is critical for maximizing points over time.

Therefore, the optimal action is to clean the dirt at (7, 4) to

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to determine the best course of action.

Current position: (7, 3)  
Agent 2 is at (7, 2) — directly above me.  
There is dirt at (7, 4) — directly to my right.  
Nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away (distance).  
Nearest dirt is at (7, 4), which is only 1 unit away — very close.

Key considerations:

1. **Immediate reward vs. future benefit**  
   - Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.  
   - However, apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed).  
   - Right now, there is dirt at (7, 4), which is adjacent to me.  
   - If I don’t clean it, apples will not spawn in that area.  
   - The nearest apple is 6 units away — that means I’d need to travel to (12, 2) to eat it, which requires clearing the path (possibly including dirt at (7, 4)) to enable apple spawning.

2. **Can I eat an apple now?**
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision for maximizing points and contributing to the group's long-term success.

I am currently at (7, 2), and I see Agent 1 at (7, 3). The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — a significant distance. The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), which is only 2 units away. That means I can reach the dirt in just two moves (up one, then up another), and cleaning it would help enable apple spawning in the future.

Now, evaluating the options:

1. **Eat an apple immediately?**  
Therefore, the optimal decision is to clean the dirt at (6, 7). This ensures future apple spawning, which will lead to greater rewards down the line.

--- Step 10 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 4). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 4), which is currently covered in dirt. The nearest apple is at (2, 5), 6 steps away — quite far. There is no dirt closer than (7, 4), so this is the only dirt currently in range. 

Key facts:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward but enables future apple spawns.
- I cannot move diagonally — movement is restricted to cardinal directions (up, down, left, right).

Now, let's evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple?**  
   There is no apple at (7, 4). The nearest apple is 6 steps away, and I’m currently on dirt. I cannot eat an apple without first reaching it. So, eating an apple is not possible right now — it's not even visible or accessible. Therefore, this option is invalid.

2. **Clean the dirt at (7, 4)?**  
   This is the only dirt in the current scan. Cleaning it would:
   - Remove dirt from the current location.
   - Potentially enable apple spawning
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (3, 0). You see an apple at (1, 0) and an apple at (2, 1).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Reasoning:

- The apple at (1, 0) is only 2 steps away, which is very close and provides an immediate +1.0 reward. This is a low-effort, high-reward action that directly increases my score.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is 8 steps away — extremely far, and cleaning it would take significant time and movement without any immediate benefit. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, cleaning dirt is necessary for future apple spawning, but that benefit is not immediate or guaranteed, and it would require a long journey.
- There are no other nearby apples or dirt to consider. The apple at (2, 1) is farther (distance ≈ √(1² + 1²) = √2 ≈ 1.4, which is actually closer than (1,0) — wait, let's recalculate.

Wait — correction:

Distance from (3,0) to (1,0): |3–1| = 2 → distance = 2  
Distance from (3,0) to (2,1): |3–2| + |0–1| = 1
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 2, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 7). You see dirt at (6, 7), dirt at (6, 8) and dirt at (7, 8).
  Thinking: I am at (6, 7), and the current observation shows that there is dirt at (6, 7), (6, 8), and (7, 8). The global scan indicates that the nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 units away — quite far. Importantly, the nearest dirt is at (6, 7), meaning I am already standing on dirt.

Now, let's analyze the trade-offs:

1. **Should I eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple currently visible or accessible at my position. The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which requires moving through multiple tiles — and there's no indication that any apples are spawning in the immediate vicinity. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), and we currently have dirt present, no apples are available to eat. Therefore, **eating an apple is not possible right now** — so this option is invalid.

2. **Should I clean dirt to ensure future apples spawn (helping the group)?**  
   This is a critical point. The rule states that apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed).

--- Step 11 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 4). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: Given the current situation, let's analyze the trade-offs carefully:

1. **Should you eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 units away. That means you'd need to move across significant terrain to reach it. Since you're currently at (7, 4), moving to (2, 5) involves a long path — and there's no indication that any apples are spawning now due to the river being clean. Additionally, apples only spawn *when the river is clean*, which depends on dirt being cleaned. Right now, the river is not clean (since dirt exists), so no apples are spawning. Therefore, **there is no apple available to eat at this moment** — the observation of "nothing of interest nearby" and the distance to the nearest apple both support this. Eating an apple would be a waste of effort because it's not currently available.

2. **Should you clean dirt to ensure future apples spawn (helping the group)?**  
   Yes — this is the most strategic move. The nearest dirt is at (7, 8), only 4 units away. Cleaning dirt directly improves the river's cleanliness, which in turn enables apple spawning. While cleaning

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 0). You see an apple at (1, 0) and an apple at (2, 1).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Reasoning:

- The apple at (1, 0) is immediately adjacent and within one move — this gives me a direct +1.0 reward with no risk or cost.
- The dirt at (6, 8) is far away (distance 12), meaning cleaning it will not provide any immediate benefit and requires significant movement without any apples in between.
- There are no apples nearby that are further than one step away, and the only apple at (2, 1) is two steps away (down to (2, 1)) — that would require a longer path and no immediate reward.
- Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, cleaning dirt is a long-term strategy. However, without any immediate apples or a clear path to dirt that would enable future apple spawns, it’s not efficient to prioritize cleaning now.
- In a cleanup game, the goal is to maximize points. Immediate rewards are essential when they are accessible. Delaying a simple, reachable apple for a distant, uncertain future benefit is suboptimal.

Therefore, eating the apple at (1, 0) gives me the immediate +1.0 point with no risk, and it is the most efficient

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 7). You see dirt at (6, 8) and dirt at (7, 8).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the current situation to determine the best course of action.

Currently, I am at (6, 7). I observe dirt at (6, 8) and (7, 8). The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 steps away — quite distant. The nearest dirt is only 1 step away (at (6, 8)), meaning it's very accessible. 

Key considerations:

1. **Immediate reward vs. long-term benefit**:
   - Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately, which is valuable for scoring.
   - However, apples only spawn when the river is clean — that is, when there is no dirt. So, dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning.
   - Currently, there is dirt present, so no apples can spawn. Cleaning dirt removes the obstacle and enables future apple generation.
   - Since the nearest apple is far away (6 steps), and we have a dirt patch just one step away, it's not practical to go and eat an apple now — we’d be moving away from a cleanable dirt patch that could enable future apple spawning.

2. **Group benefit**:
   - The goal is to maximize points *for the group*. While

--- Step 10 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 4). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 4), and I see dirt at that exact location. The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 steps away. There is no apple currently visible or nearby — the only food source is distant. The dirt at (7, 4) is the nearest dirt, and cleaning it would not immediately yield reward, but it would improve the river's cleanliness and allow apples to spawn in the future.

Let’s analyze the trade-off:

1. **Eat an apple?**  
   There is no apple at (7, 4). The nearest apple is 6 steps away. Eating an apple would require moving to (2, 5), which is far and requires traversing potentially dirty or unclean terrain. Since there's no apple currently available, and we have no immediate access to one, eating one now would be impossible. So this option is not feasible.

2. **Clean the dirt?**  
   The dirt at (7, 4) is directly where I am. Cleaning it would improve the river’s cleanliness, which increases the chance of apples spawning in the future — especially since apples only spawn when the river is clean. This is a strategic long-term move. Even though there's no

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4), even though it doesn't provide immediate reward.

Here's why:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — a significant distance. Eating it now would give only +1.0 point, but it's not in immediate reach.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 2 units away — very close. Cleaning it will improve the river's cleanliness, which increases the chance of apples spawning in the future, especially since apples only spawn when the river is clean.
- The game's structure rewards long-term success: cleaning dirt enables future apple spawns, which benefits the group and increases overall points over time.
- Since I'm at (7, 2), moving to (7, 4) is a simple vertical move (one step up), and I can clean it efficiently.
- There's no immediate reward for staying idle or eating an apple at this moment — the apple at (12, 2) is too far to be practical to reach without first ensuring the environment is conducive to more apples.

Therefore, the optimal strategy is to clean the dirt at (7, 4). This action improves the game state, increases future

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 7). You see dirt at (6, 7) and dirt at (6, 8).
  Thinking: I am at (6, 7), and I observe dirt at both (6, 7) and (6, 8). The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 steps away. Currently, there is no apple visible nearby — the closest apple is far away, and the only dirt is at my current position and one step north.

Let’s break down the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward**  
   - There is no apple at (6, 7) or (6, 8). I cannot eat an apple immediately.  
   - The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 steps away — too far to reach without cleaning dirt first.  
   - Therefore, **eating an apple is not possible now**. This option is invalid.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning**  
   - Dirt must be cleaned to allow apples to spawn.  
   - The current dirt at (6, 7) and (6, 8) can be cleaned.  
   - Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it is essential for enabling apples to appear later.

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 4). You see agent 2 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to determine the best course of action.

Current position: (7, 4)  
Agent 2 is at (7, 3) — directly above me, so we’re in the same column, just one step apart. This means there’s potential for interaction or coordination, though it's not yet clear if that’s relevant.

Global scan:
- Nearest apple is at (2, 5), distance = 6 steps (requires moving left and up).
- Nearest dirt is at (6, 0), distance = 5 steps (requires moving left and down).

Key rule: Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning. Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning. Eating apples gives +1.0 per apple, which is an immediate reward.

Now, trade-off analysis:

1. **Should I eat an apple now?**  
   The nearest apple is 6 steps away — quite far. I have no apple in immediate reach. Eating one would require movement to reach it, and there's no indication of an apple being nearby (e.g., at (7,4) or (7,3)). So,
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 1 at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision.

Current position: (7, 3)  
Agent 1 is at (7, 4) — directly above me, so we're in close proximity.  
Nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away (distance = |12–7| + |2–3| = 5 + 1 = 6).  
Nearest dirt is at (6, 0), which is 4 units away (|6–7| + |0–3| = 1 + 3 = 4).  

Now, evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   - The nearest apple is 6 steps away.  
   - Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.  
   - However, apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning cleaning dirt is a prerequisite.  
   - If we eat an apple now, we’re not contributing to cleaning dirt, which may prevent future apple spawns.  
   - Since apples are not currently spawning (because dirt is present), eating one now would be a waste of a chance to enable future rewards.  
   - Also, we

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 7). You see dirt at (6, 8).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 8).

Here's the reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible nearby — the nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 steps away. Eating an apple now would require a long path and is not immediately accessible.
- The dirt at (6, 8) is just one step away — a very short and efficient action.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean, meaning reducing dirt directly enables future apple spawns. Since the global scan shows the nearest apple is far away, the long-term benefit of enabling apple spawning through cleaning is critical.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it is a prerequisite for future rewards. Without cleaning, apples will not spawn — so the action is a strategic investment in future gains.
- The game mechanics suggest that cleaning is a necessary condition for apple generation, not a standalone reward. Therefore, acting now to clean dirt aligns with the core goal of maximizing points over time.

Given that the dirt is adjacent and the apple is far away, the optimal strategy is to clean the dirt first — this enables future apple spawns, which will eventually lead to more points. This is a rational, long-term decision that supports the group's success.

Agent 3 (High-Level):

  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 7).

Reasoning:

- Apples only spawn when the river is clean, meaning dirt must be removed to enable apple spawning. Right now, there is dirt at (6, 7), which is adjacent to my current position (6, 6). This dirt is blocking the possibility of apples appearing in that area or nearby.
- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 steps away — not immediately accessible. Eating it now would give +1.0, but it's not urgent or strategically beneficial in the long term.
- Cleaning dirt does not give immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning. Since apples are the only source of points, and they don’t spawn unless the river is clean, removing dirt is a necessary prerequisite for future gains.
- Moving to (6, 7) to clean it is a simple, low-risk action (only one step), and it directly contributes to the long-term goal of maximizing apple spawns.
- There is no nearby dirt to clean that would be more impactful than (6, 7), and since this is the nearest dirt, addressing it first makes sense as a foundational step.

Therefore, cleaning the dirt at (6, 7

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 4). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: Currently, I am at (7, 4), and there is dirt at that exact location. There are no apples visible in my immediate vicinity — the nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 units away. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), and I am currently standing on dirt, I cannot eat an apple right now.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → Not possible. There is no apple at (7, 4). The nearest apple is far away (6 steps), and I can't reach it without first cleaning the dirt. Also, apples don’t spawn on dirt — they only appear on clean land. So, eating an apple now is not feasible.

2. **Clean the dirt at (7, 4) to enable future apple spawning?**  
   → This is essential. By cleaning the dirt, I convert a dirt cell into clean land. Once clean, that location becomes eligible for apple spawning. Since the nearest apple is far away, and apples only spawn on clean land, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple generation. This action supports the group's long-term goal of maximizing apple

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4), even though there's no immediate reward.

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — a significant distance. There are no visible apples nearby at (7, 2), and we're currently at a position with no visible food.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), just 2 units away. Cleaning dirt is essential because apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt removal enables future apple spawning. Without cleaning, no apples will appear, regardless of how far we walk.
- Eating an apple now would give a +1.0 reward, but there are no apples visible in the immediate vicinity. The apple at (12, 2) is too far to reach without first ensuring the environment is clean — and even then, it might not spawn until dirt is cleared.
- Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for any future apple access. Skipping this now would mean the group can never spawn apples, even if we eventually reach (12, 2).
- There's no immediate benefit to eating an apple here — we have no apple in sight, and

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 7). You see dirt at (6, 7) and dirt at (6, 8).
  Thinking: I am at (6, 7), and I observe dirt at both (6, 7) and (6, 8). The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 steps away — quite far. Currently, there is no apple visible nearby, and the only dirt present is at my current location and one step north.

Key points to consider:

- **Immediate reward**: Eating an apple gives +1.0 point. However, there is no apple in immediate range. The nearest apple is 6 steps away, and there's no indication that any apples are spawning now because the river is not clean. Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be removed.
- **Cleaning dirt**: Removing dirt at (6, 7) or (6, 8) will improve the river’s cleanliness, which increases the chance of apples spawning in the future. This is a long-term strategy that benefits the group, even if there's no immediate gain.
- **No nearby apples**: Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and currently there are no apples visible, we cannot assume any are available now. Therefore, eating an apple is not feasible right now.

**Trade-off analysis**:

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 4). You see agent 2 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision for maximizing points while supporting the group's long-term goals.

Currently, I am at (7, 4), and Agent 2 is at (7, 3) — directly above me, so we're in close proximity. The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is a distance of 6 steps away. That means I’d need to move left and up to reach it. The nearest dirt is at (6, 0), which is 5 steps away — a significant distance, but cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apples to spawn in the future.

Now, the key trade-off:

1. **Eating an apple now** gives +1.0 point immediately. But there are no apples visible near me — the nearest is 6 steps away. I would need to travel to (2, 5) to reach it, and that’s a long journey. Since I can't move diagonally, it will take at least 6 moves. During that time, I’m not gaining any points. Also, if I go to eat an apple, I’m not cleaning dirt, which is critical for enabling future apple spawns.

2. **Cleaning dirt** is not

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 1 at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to make the best decision as Agent 2.

Current position: (7, 3)  
Agent 1 is at (7, 4) — directly above me, so we're adjacent. This means we can potentially coordinate or avoid conflict.

Global scan:
- Nearest apple: (12, 2), distance = 6
- Nearest dirt: (6, 0), distance = 4

Important context:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed).
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but enables future apple spawning.
- I earn +1.0 per apple eaten.
- I cannot move diagonally — so movement is restricted to cardinal directions.

Now, the trade-off:

1. **Eat an apple now?**  
   The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 steps away. That’s a long distance. To reach it, I’d need to move:  
   (7,3) → (7,4) → (7,5) → (7,6) → (7,7) → (8,7) → (9,7) → (10,
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 7). You see dirt at (6, 8).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 8).

Reasoning:

- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Right now, there is dirt at (6, 8), which is directly adjacent to my current position (6, 7). This dirt is blocking apple spawning in that area, and since apples are essential for scoring, removing it is a prerequisite for future apple generation.
- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 units away. That means I would need to move through several tiles to reach it — and if there's dirt blocking the path or if the river remains dirty, apples may not spawn at all, making the apple unreachable.
- Eating an apple now is not possible because there is no apple visible at my current position. The only apple is far away and not accessible without first ensuring the environment is clean.
- Cleaning dirt provides no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning. This is a long-term investment in the group’s success — without cleaning, apples may not appear at all, and the group will fail to score.
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here’s the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away — quite far. Eating it would give a +1.0 reward, but it’s not immediately accessible or likely to be the only apple available in the long term.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 unit away — extremely close. Cleaning it will improve the river's cleanliness, which directly increases the chance of apples spawning in the future. Apples only spawn when the river is clean, so cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple generation.
- There is no immediate reward for cleaning dirt (it gives 0 points), but it enables future rewards. Since apples are the only source of points and they depend on a clean river, this action is a strategic investment.
- The goal is to maximize points over time, not just in the short term. If we don’t clean the dirt, no apples will spawn — even if we walk to (2, 5), there will be no apples there. Cleaning now ensures future apple spawning, possibly at (2, 5) or other locations as the river becomes cleaner.
- Moving to clean the dirt is a

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — far enough that immediate consumption is not practical or efficient.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 unit away from my current position (7, 3), making it extremely accessible.
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple generation. Without cleaning, no apples can appear, even if they are nearby.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 point, but it would be a short-term gain with no long-term benefit, especially since apples are not spawning anyway due to dirty conditions.
- Cleaning dirt does not give immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning — which benefits the group and increases long-term potential for points.
- Since agent 2 is at (7, 2), which is directly above me, and there's no indication they are blocking movement or acting aggressively, there's no immediate threat or conflict.
- Moving to (7, 4) to clean is a simple, safe, and strategic move that addresses the core requirement for apple spawning.

Therefore, cleaning the dirt
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the trade-off between immediate reward and long-term benefit.

Currently, I am at (7, 2), and I see Agent 1 at (7, 3). The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — a reasonable distance but not immediate. The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), just 2 units away. That means I can reach the dirt in one move (up from (7, 2) to (7, 3), then to (7, 4)).

Key observations:
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately, which is valuable.
- However, apples only spawn when the river is clean — i.e., when dirt is removed. So, if I don’t clean dirt, no apples will appear, and the group will miss out on future rewards.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is very close — only 2 units away. Cleaning it is a minimal effort.
- There’s no apple currently visible nearby — the nearest is 5 units away. So, eating an apple now would require moving to (12, 2), which is far from where I am and would require at least 5 moves
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away — far enough that immediate consumption is not practical or efficient.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 unit away, meaning it's very close and directly accessible.
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple generation.
- While eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately, the apples are not spawning now because the river is dirty. Without cleaning, no apples will appear, and future rewards are blocked.
- Cleaning dirt provides no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning — which is essential for long-term point accumulation and group success.
- Since we are at (7, 5) and the dirt is at (7, 4), moving one step north (to (7, 4)) is a simple, low-cost action that directly improves the environment.

Therefore, the trade-off favors cleaning the dirt over eating an apple — because apples cannot spawn until the river is clean, and this action enables future rewards. It's a necessary investment in the system's sustainability.

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — quite far. Eating it immediately would give +1.0 point, but that would only be a one-time reward with no impact on future apple spawning.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is just 1 unit away — extremely close. Cleaning it would reduce the overall dirt in the environment, which increases the chance of apples spawning in the future. This directly supports the long-term goal of maximizing points through apple harvesting.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when there is less dirt). So, cleaning dirt is not just a passive action — it's a prerequisite for future apple generation.
- There is no immediate benefit to eating an apple now, especially since it's far away and we have a nearby dirt patch that can be cleaned with minimal cost in movement.
- Agent 2 is at (7, 2), directly above me. While this might suggest competition, there's no indication of conflict or shared resources being at risk — and since we're both agents in the same cleanup game, cooperation (like cleaning dirt) likely benefits the group
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision.

Currently, I am at (7, 2), and I see Agent 1 at (7, 3). The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — a moderate distance. The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), just one step away in the positive y-direction. This dirt is directly adjacent to me, so cleaning it would be a very low-effort action.

Key points:
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately, which is a direct reward.
- Cleaning dirt doesn’t give immediate reward, but it enables apples to spawn in the future — which benefits the group.
- The dirt is very close (distance 1), so cleaning it would take minimal time and energy.
- There are no immediate threats or obstacles mentioned.
- The apple at (12, 2) is 5 steps away — I would need to move right to (8,2), then (9,2), (10,2), (11,2), (12,2). That’s a long path, and I have no guarantee that apples will spawn until the river is clean.

But here's the critical
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away — quite distant. Eating it now would give only +1.0 point, but it's not immediately actionable due to distance and the lack of nearby apple spawn conditions.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is directly adjacent and only 1 unit away — this is a critical location because apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Cleaning dirt is not rewarding immediately, but it enables future apple spawning, which benefits the group and increases long-term points.
- Since apples spawn only when the river is clean, and dirt is blocking apple generation, removing this dirt is a prerequisite for future apple access. Without cleaning it, no apples will appear in that area, even if we move toward (2, 5).
- There’s no immediate benefit to eating the faraway apple — it’s not within reach for a short path, and the group’s long-term success depends on enabling apple spawning through clean land.

Therefore, the optimal action is to clean the dirt at (6, 7). This

--- Step 10 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 4). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 4), and there is dirt at this location. The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 steps away. There is no dirt anywhere else in the global scan — the nearest dirt is at (7, 4), meaning this is the only dirt currently present.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple at (7, 4). The nearest apple is 6 steps away, and we are currently on dirt. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — i.e., when dirt is cleaned. Since we are currently on dirt, no apple is available for immediate consumption. Therefore, **eating an apple is not possible right now**.

2. **Clean the dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   Yes. Cleaning dirt is essential because apples only appear on land when the river is clean. Since we are currently on dirt at (7, 4), cleaning it would transform that location into land, which could eventually allow an apple to spawn there — especially if the apple spawns are influenced by proximity or clean zones. Even though there's no immediate reward, this action supports the group’s long-term goal of
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4), even though it doesn’t give immediate reward.

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — a significant distance. There’s no visible apple nearby at (7, 2), and the current observation says "you see nothing of interest nearby."
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), only 2 units away — very close and accessible.
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. This means cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple spawning. Without cleaning, even if an apple were available, it wouldn't appear.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 point, but it’s not currently available. Since no apple is visible or reachable in the immediate vicinity, attempting to eat one now is futile.
- Cleaning dirt is not rewarding immediately, but it enables future apple spawning — which is essential for long-term point accumulation and group success.
- Given that the dirt is only 2 steps away (down to (7, 3), then to (7, 4)), it's a low-effort, high-impact action that directly supports future rewards.
- There's no indication
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 7). You see dirt at (6, 7) and dirt at (6, 8).
  Thinking: I am at (6, 7), and I observe dirt at both (6, 7) and (6, 8). The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 units away — quite distant. There is no apple currently visible in my immediate vicinity, and the only dirt is at (6, 7) and (6, 8). 

Now, let's analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There is no apple at (6, 7) or (6, 8). The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is far away and requires movement through potentially dirty terrain. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), and currently there is dirt present, no apples are spawning. Therefore, **eating an apple is not possible right now**. Attempting to eat an apple would be futile — no apple is available.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   → Yes. Dirt must be cleaned to allow apples to spawn. The dirt at (6, 7) and (6, 8) are blocking apple generation. By cleaning them, I contribute to

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 4). You see agent 2 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to determine the best course of action.

Current position: (7, 4)  
Agent 2 is at (7, 3) — directly above me, so we're adjacent. This suggests potential coordination or competition, but since we're both agents with individual goals (eating apples), and no explicit rule about cooperation or conflict, I should focus on my own objective: maximizing points via apples.

Key facts:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned).
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward but enables future apple spawning.
- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 units away.
- The nearest dirt is at (6, 0), which is 5 units away.

Distance-wise:
- To reach the apple at (2, 5): path would require moving left 5, then up 1 → total 6 steps.
- To reach the dirt at (6, 0): move right 1, then down 4 → total 5 steps.

So, cleaning dirt is *closer* than reaching the apple.

But here's the key trade-off:
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately.
- Cleaning
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 1 at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to make the best decision as Agent 2.

Current position: (7, 3)  
Agent 1 is at (7, 4) — directly above me, so we're in the same column.  
Nearest apple: (12, 2), distance = 6 steps (requires moving right and down).  
Nearest dirt: (6, 0), distance = 4 steps (requires moving left and down).  

Now, evaluating the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   - Apples give +1.0 each — a clear reward.  
   - However, apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned).  
   - The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 steps away — quite far.  
   - If there's no dirt nearby, no apples will spawn.  
   - Since the nearest dirt is at (6, 0), which is 4 steps away, and we're at (7, 3), we must first clean dirt to enable apple spawning.  
   - Therefore, **apples are not currently available** — they are not spawning because the

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 7). You see dirt at (6, 8).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 8).

Here's the reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible nearby (the nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 units away), and we are at (6, 7), so we would need to travel significantly to reach it. Eating an apple now would give a +1.0 reward, but it would require moving to a location where apples are not currently spawning—meaning the river is dirty, and apples won't spawn until the dirt is cleaned.
  
- The dirt at (6, 8) is only 1 unit away—very close. Cleaning it would improve the river's cleanliness, which directly enables apple spawning in the future. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, cleaning this dirt is a necessary step to unlock future apple opportunities.

- While eating an apple now gives immediate reward, it's a short-term gain with no long-term benefit. The global scan shows that the nearest apple is far away and likely won't spawn unless the river is cleaned. Thus, acting now to clean the dirt ensures that future apple spawning becomes possible—potentially enabling multiple apples to spawn over time, which would yield greater cumulative rewards.

- There’s no immediate

  Obs: You are at (6, 7). You see dirt at (6, 8) and dirt at (7, 8).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 8) and (7, 8).

Here's the reasoning:

- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Right now, there is dirt at (6,8) and (7,8), which means those spots are not suitable for apples. Cleaning this dirt is essential to enable future apple spawning.
- The nearest apple is at (2,5), which is 6 steps away — a significant distance. Even if I could reach it, there's no immediate benefit to eating it now, especially since apples are not spawning due to the presence of dirt.
- Eating an apple now would give a +1.0 reward, but that reward is temporary and does not contribute to the long-term goal of enabling more apples to spawn. Since apples depend on a clean river (i.e., no dirt), cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple growth.
- The dirt at (6,8) is only 1 step away — very close and immediately actionable. Cleaning it will improve the environment and may eventually lead to apple spawning in nearby areas.
- There's no nearby apple currently spawning, so the immediate reward of eating one is not justified by the long-term benefits.

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to analyze the trade-off carefully based on the current situation and long-term goals.

Currently, I am at (7, 5). The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away — a significant distance. There's no immediate apple in sight, and I see nothing of interest nearby. That means eating an apple immediately is not feasible without movement.

The nearest dirt is at (7, 8), which is only 3 units away — very close. Cleaning dirt is essential because apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when there's less dirt). So, if I clean this dirt, I’m enabling future apple spawning, which benefits both my group and my own long-term ability to collect apples.

Even though cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, it's a necessary prerequisite for apple spawning. Without cleaning dirt, apples won’t appear, and I’ll be stuck in a cycle of movement without food.

Moreover, since the nearest apple is 5 steps away and the dirt is only 3 steps away, it’s more efficient to first clean the dirt at (7,8). After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner, which increases the chance of apples appearing in the area — possibly even at (2,5
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 8}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (1, 0). You see an apple at (1, 0) and an apple at (2, 1).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0) for immediate reward.

Reasoning:

- The apple at (1, 0) is directly adjacent and within reach — distance 0. This gives me an instant +1.0 point, which directly increases my score.
- There is no immediate benefit to cleaning dirt at (6, 8), which is 13 units away. Cleaning dirt requires movement and time, and since no apples are currently spawning (apples only spawn when the river is clean), the future benefit is uncertain and delayed.
- There are no other nearby apples or dirt to consider. The apple at (2, 1) is at distance 1, which is reachable, but it's not immediately available — I could eat it later, but only if I first decide to move.
- In a cleanup game, while cleaning dirt supports long-term apple spawning, the immediate reward from eating an apple (especially when one is already at hand) provides tangible progress toward the goal of maximizing points.
- Since I have no information about how many apples will spawn after cleaning, or whether the dirt at (6,8) is the only one, I cannot assume that cleaning is worth the cost of time and movement.

Therefore, the optimal
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 1, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'eat'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 8). You see dirt at (6, 8) and dirt at (7, 8).
  Thinking: I am at (6, 8), and I observe dirt at both (6, 8) and (7, 8). The nearest apple is at (1, 8), which is 5 units away — a significant distance. Currently, there is no apple spawning because there is dirt present. According to the rules, apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be removed to enable apple growth.

Key points:
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately, but there is no apple available at my current position.
- The dirt at (6, 8) and (7, 8) must be cleaned to allow apples to spawn in the future. Cleaning dirt provides no immediate reward, but it is a prerequisite for future apple spawning.
- There is no apple currently visible or reachable without first cleaning dirt. Moving toward (1, 8) would require crossing potentially dirty terrain and may not yield apples until dirt is cleaned.
- Since the nearest apple is 5 units away and no apple is currently visible in the immediate vicinity, I cannot eat one now.

Therefore, the immediate action must be to clean the dirt to enable future apple spawning. This supports the group’s long-term goal and aligns with the

--- Step 13 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 6). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am currently at (7, 6). The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 units away — a significant distance. There is no visible apple in immediate range, and I see nothing of interest nearby. The nearest dirt is at (7, 8), just 2 units away — very close and directly above me.

Now, let’s evaluate the trade-offs:

1. **Eating an apple for immediate reward**:  
   There is no apple visible or accessible nearby. The nearest apple is 6 steps away, and I have no information about whether it's spawnable or accessible now. Eating an apple would require movement and time, and given the distance and lack of immediate visibility, this would not provide a useful reward right now. Also, apples only spawn when the river is clean — which depends on dirt being cleaned. If the dirt at (7,8) is not cleaned, apples won’t spawn at all. So, without cleaning dirt, there's no guarantee of apple availability, even if I walk to (2,5).

2. **Cleaning dirt to enable future apple spawning**:  
   The dirt at (7,8) is only
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 8}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (1, 0). You see an apple at (2, 1).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (2, 1).

Here’s the reasoning:

- The apple is at (2, 1), which is only 2 steps away — a very short distance. Since the goal is to maximize points and apples give +1.0 each, an immediate reward is available and accessible.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 8), which is 14 steps away. Cleaning that dirt would provide long-term benefits (enabling future apple spawns), but it requires significant time and movement with no immediate reward. Given that we are in a cleanup game where immediate action is critical, and the current environment already has an apple, delaying action to clean dirt is suboptimal.
- There is no indication that the dirt at (7, 8) is the only dirt or that cleaning it is necessary for apple spawning in the immediate vicinity. The apple at (2, 1) is already present, meaning the river is currently clean enough for spawning — so we don’t need to clean dirt *now* to spawn apples.
- Cleaning dirt is a necessary prerequisite for apple generation. Without it, even if I move toward the apple at (2, 5), it won’t spawn — so I’m

--- Step 12 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the current situation and make a strategic decision based on the rules and goals.

**Current Observation:**
- I am at (7, 3).
- Agent 2 is at (7, 2), directly above me.
- There is dirt at (7, 4), which is directly to my right.
- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), 6 units away.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), just 1 unit away.

**Key Rules & Objectives:**
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 points immediately.
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it is necessary for future apple generation.
- Movement is only allowed in cardinal directions (up, down, left, right) — no diagonals.

**Trade-off Analysis:**

1. **Should I eat an apple?**  
   The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away. I am not near any apple currently. There is no apple visible at (7, 3) or nearby. Therefore, I cannot eat an apple immediately.
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am at (7, 2), and I see Agent 1 at (7, 3). The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — that’s a considerable distance. The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), which is only 2 units away. That means I can reach the dirt in just one step (up to (7, 3), then to (7, 4)) — a very short move.

Now, let's evaluate the trade-offs:

1. **Eating an apple for immediate reward**:  
   The nearest apple is 5 steps away. I would have to move to (12, 2), which is far from my current position. Since there's no apple currently visible nearby, and the apple spawns only when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), eating an apple now would require me to travel to a distant location — and even if I could reach it, the apple may not spawn unless the river is clean. So, eating an apple now would be inefficient and possibly futile, especially if I can't guarantee the apple exists at that spot.

2. **
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away — far enough that reaching it would require a significant path and time. There are no immediate apples nearby, and no visible apple spawn zones currently.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 unit away — very close. Cleaning it will improve the river's cleanliness, which directly increases the chance of apples spawning in the future. This is a necessary prerequisite for long-term apple availability.
- Eating an apple now would give a +1.0 reward, but there are no apples in immediate proximity. The apple at (2, 5) is too far to be practical to reach without a clear path and without first ensuring the environment is conducive to apple spawning.
- Cleaning dirt has no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning — which is critical for sustained point accumulation. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, cleaning dirt is a foundational step.
- There's no indication of other nearby dirt or apple spawn points, so prioritizing the immediate, actionable step (cleaning the dirt) is optimal.

Therefore, the trade-off favors cleaning the dirt. This action supports

--- Step 13 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully and make a strategic decision based on the rules and current state.

Current position: (7, 3)  
Agent 2 is at (7, 2) — directly above me.  
Dirt is at (7, 4) — directly to my right.  
Nearest apple is at (12, 2), 6 steps away.  
The nearest dirt is only 1 step away — at (7, 4).

Key rules:
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed).
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but enables future apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.
- You cannot move diagonally — only up, down, left, right.

Now, the trade-off:

1. **Eat an apple now?**  
   The nearest apple is 6 steps away. To reach it, I’d need to go from (7,3) → (7,2) → (7,1) → (7,0) → (6,0) → (5,0) → (4,0) → (3,0) → (2,0) → (
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am at (7, 2), and I see Agent 1 at (7, 3) — they are directly above me, one step away. That means we're in close proximity, and we might be able to coordinate or at least avoid conflict.

The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 steps away — that's a moderate distance. However, apples only spawn when the river is clean, meaning dirt must be cleaned first. Right now, the nearest dirt is at (7, 4), just one step above me — distance 2. That means I can reach it in two moves.

Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning. Since apples are the only source of points (+1.0 each), and we're in a cooperative cleanup game, helping clean the river supports the group's long-term success.

Currently, there is no apple nearby — the nearest is 5 steps away — so eating an apple now would be unproductive. There's no immediate point gain from eating, and no apple is in immediate range.

Moreover, if I clean the dirt at (7,4), I can eventually enable apple spawning
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away. That means it's not immediately accessible, and even if I were to move toward it, I’d have to traverse several steps without any immediate reward.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 step away — very close. Cleaning it will improve the river's cleanliness, which directly enables apple spawning in the future. This is a critical prerequisite: apples only spawn when the river is clean.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0, but there are no apples nearby — the nearest one is far away and requires a clean river to even be available. Without cleaning the dirt, the river remains dirty, and apples won’t spawn, so no apples will be available in the future.
- The goal is to maximize points over time, not just immediate gains. Cleaning dirt is a necessary investment that enables future apple spawning. Since apples spawn only when the river is clean, and we have a dirt spot right next to us, it's rational to clean it first.
- There is no immediate benefit to eating an apple now — no apples are in range, and even

--- Step 14 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
   The nearest apple is 5 steps away. I would have to move to (12, 2) to eat it — a long journey. Since I’m already at (7, 2), and the apple is on the same row (row 2), I could walk right to (12, 2). But that path is open — no dirt or obstacles mentioned. However, apples only spawn *when the river is clean*, meaning that even if an apple is present, if the river is dirty, it might not be sustainable or accessible. But in this case
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away. To reach it, I’d need to move through multiple tiles, possibly including more dirt. However, apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be removed to enable apple generation. Right now, there is dirt at (7, 4), which is just one step away. This dirt is blocking the possibility of spawning apples in that area.

- Eating an apple now would give me +1.0 point, but that apple is not currently available — I don’t see one at my current location. The apple at (2, 5) is far away and not accessible without clearing obstacles. Moreover, even if I could reach it, it might not spawn unless the river is clean. Since the dirt at (7, 4) is directly adjacent, and cleaning it would improve the overall river cleanliness, it enables future apple spawning.

- Cleaning dirt has no immediate reward, but it's a necessary precondition for apples to appear. In a long-term strategy, this action increases the probability of future apple spawns, which directly benefits the group’s total points. This aligns with

--- Step 12 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — quite far. Eating it immediately would give only +1.0 point, but it would require a long path and likely pass through or near the dirt at (7, 4), which is currently blocking progress.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 unit away from my current position (7, 3), making it extremely accessible. Cleaning it is a low-effort, high-impact action that directly improves the environment for future apple spawning.
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. By removing dirt at (7, 4), I enable the possibility of apples appearing in that area or nearby, which would benefit the entire group — including myself in the future.
- There is no immediate reward for cleaning dirt, but the long-term benefit of enabling apple spawning is critical. Since apples are the only source of points, and they are currently unavailable due to dirt, cleaning is a necessary prerequisite.
- Moving to clean the dirt is a minimal action (one step south to (7, 4)), and it sets the stage for future
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am at (7, 2), and I see Agent 1 at (7, 3) — directly above me. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away horizontally. That means I'd need to move right to reach it. The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), which is only 2 units above me — directly north. Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apples to spawn, which benefits the group in the long term, but it gives no immediate reward.

Now, consider the trade-off:

1. **Eating an apple for immediate reward**:  
   The apple at (12, 2) is 5 units away — a significant distance. I can't move diagonally, so I'd need to move right to (7, 3), then (7, 4), (7, 5), etc., to get to (12, 2). But the path is long and may require passing through other areas. Also, I don't know if that apple is currently spawnable — apples only spawn when the river is clean. Since the dirt at (7, 4) is only
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away — far from my current position at (7, 5). Eating it would require a long path and offers only a +1.0 reward, which is minimal compared to the long-term benefits.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 unit away — very close and immediately accessible. Cleaning it will improve the river's cleanliness, which increases the chance of apples spawning in the future.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean. Therefore, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple generation. Without cleaning, no apples will appear, even if we're close to them.
- Since apples are not currently spawning due to dirt, and we have a direct opportunity to clean a single unit of dirt (which requires no cost and has no immediate penalty), this is a strategic investment in future rewards.
- The group's success depends on enabling apple spawning, not just immediate consumption. Cleaning dirt supports collective progress and ensures more apples become available over time.

Therefore, cleaning the dirt at (7, 4) is the optimal action — it enables future apple spawning and aligns with the

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here's my reasoning:

- There are no apples immediately available at my current position (7, 3). The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — far enough that immediate apple consumption is not feasible.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 unit away — very close and directly in my line of sight. Cleaning it would be a low-effort, high-impact action.
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Since dirt is blocking apple spawning, removing it enables future apple generation. This is a critical prerequisite for long-term success.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 reward, but there are no apples in range for me to eat immediately. Even if I moved toward (12, 2), I’d have to pass through or near (7, 4) to get there — and without cleaning the dirt, apples won’t spawn in that area.
- Cleaning the dirt doesn't give immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning — which benefits both me and the group. This aligns with the goal of maximizing points through sustainable, group-advancing actions.

Therefore,
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to decide the best course of action.

Currently, I am at (7, 2), and I see Agent 1 at (7, 3). The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — a reasonable distance, but not immediate. The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), just one step away. That dirt is only 2 units away, so it's very close and accessible.

Now, let's consider the trade-offs:

1. **Eating an apple for immediate reward**:  
   The apple at (12, 2) is 5 steps away. Since I can't move diagonally, I'd need to move right to (7, 3), then up or right to reach it. But I don't see any apples nearby — the nearest is 5 steps away. There’s no apple in immediate range. So eating one now would require significant movement and effort with no immediate benefit. Also, apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apple spawning. So unless I clean dirt first, no apples will appear in the future.

2. **Cleaning dirt to enable future apple spawning**:  
   The

Agent 3 (High-Level):

--- Step 12 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the current situation to determine the best course of action.

Currently, I am at (7, 5). The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away — a significant distance. The nearest dirt is at (7, 8), just 3 units away. This means I can reach the dirt in a few moves (up one square to (7,6), then to (7,7), then to (7,8)).

Key points:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately, but apples don’t spawn unless the river is clean.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it's necessary for future apple spawning.
- I can’t move diagonally, so movement is constrained to cardinal directions.

Now, the trade-off:
1. **Eat an apple now?**  
   The apple at (2,5) is 5 steps away. I can reach it, but only if I have a path. However, since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and there’s currently dirt at (7,8), the apple at (2,5)
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 8}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (1, 0). You see an apple at (1, 0) and an apple at (2, 1).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0) for immediate reward.

Here's the reasoning:

- The apple at (1, 0) is directly adjacent and at distance 0 — this means I can eat it instantly with no movement cost.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point, which is a clear, immediate reward with no risk.
- The nearest dirt is at (6, 8), which is 13 units away. Cleaning it would require a significant amount of movement and time, and there's no guarantee that it will result in apple spawns in a timely manner.
- There are currently apples available at (1, 0) and (2, 1). The apple at (2, 1) is at distance 1, which is close but not immediate. Since I'm already at (1, 0), I can reach it in one move, but that would delay the immediate reward.
- The rule states that apples only spawn when the river is clean — but this is a long-term condition. In the absence of immediate rewards and with no visible benefit from cleaning dirt now, it's irrational to forgo immediate points for a future possibility that is far away and uncertain.
- Since I have no information about
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 1, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'eat'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 8). You see dirt at (6, 8) and dirt at (7, 8).
  Thinking: I am at (6, 8), and the current observation shows dirt at both (6, 8) and (7, 8). The global scan reveals that the nearest apple is at (1, 8), which is 5 units away — a significant distance. There is no apple currently visible at my position, and the dirt at (6, 8) is directly adjacent, meaning I can clean it immediately.

Let’s evaluate the trade-offs:

1. **Eat an apple?**  
   There is no apple at (6, 8) or (7, 8). The nearest apple is at (1, 8), which requires moving left and up. Since I’m at (6, 8), reaching (1, 8) would require moving 5 steps (north-south only, since no diagonal movement is allowed). Eating an apple would give +1.0 point, but only if I can reach it. However, I cannot eat an apple without being in its location. Since no apple is present at my current position, I cannot eat one immediately. So this option is not viable now.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   This is critical. The rule states: *

--- Step 13 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 6). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: Given the current situation, let's analyze the trade-offs carefully:

1. **Immediate Apple Reward?**  
   The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 units away. Since you're at (7, 6), moving to that apple would require a path through potentially dirty terrain. More importantly, apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning, apples are *not* guaranteed to exist unless dirt is cleaned. Right now, there is dirt at (7, 8), just 2 units away. That suggests the river is currently dirty, and thus, apples are unlikely to spawn — even if you reach (2, 5), the apple may not be there or may not spawn at all. Therefore, eating an apple now is risky: it may not even be available due to the current state of the river.

2. **Clean Dirt to Enable Future Apples?**  
   The dirt at (7, 8) is within reach — only 2 steps away. Cleaning it would improve the river's cleanliness, which increases the probability of future apple spawning. Since apples are the only source of points, and they are currently restricted due to dirt, cleaning this dirt is a *necessary precondition* for future apple generation

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (1, 0). You see an apple at (2, 1).
  Thinking: Given the current situation, let's analyze the trade-off carefully.

You are at position (1, 0). There is an apple at (2, 1), which is just one step away in the positive x-direction and one step in the positive y-direction — a distance of √(1² + 1²) = √2 ≈ 1.41 units. Since you cannot move diagonally, you must move step-by-step: first to (1,1), then to (2,1). That’s two moves. Eating this apple would give you +1.0 point immediately.

However, the global scan shows that the nearest dirt is at (7,8), which is 14 units away — far beyond any immediate reach. Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning, but since no apples are currently spawning (apples only appear when the river is clean), and we are currently at a location with an apple already present, the dirt cleanup is not urgent.

The key insight: **apples already exist** — we have a visible apple at (2,1). This means the river is already clean enough to spawn apples *at this location*. Therefore, the immediate need to clean dirt is not present. The dirt

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 8). You see dirt at (7, 8).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 8).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (1, 8), which is 5 units away. To reach it, I would need to move through several tiles — including (6,8) → (7,8) → (8,8) → (8,7) → (8,6) → (8,5) → (8,4) → (8,3) → (8,2) → (8,1) → (7,1) → (6,1) → (5,1) → (4,1) → (3,1) → (2,1) → (1,1) → (1,2) → (1,3) → (1,4) → (1,5) → (1,6) → (1,7) → (1,8). That's a long path, and it's not even certain that apples will spawn there — they only spawn when the river is clean.

- The dirt at (7,8) is just one tile away. Cleaning it would improve the river's cleanliness, which increases the chance of apples spawning in the future — especially

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 7). You see dirt at (7, 8) and agent 3 at (7, 8).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 8).

Reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 6 units away — not immediately accessible. Eating an apple now would require moving to that location, which is far and would take time.
- There is dirt at (7, 8), just one step away. Cleaning it would improve the environment by reducing dirt and enabling apple spawning in the future. This is a necessary prerequisite for apples to appear — without cleaning dirt, apples won’t spawn, regardless of how far away they are.
- The presence of Agent 3 at (7, 8) suggests this location is occupied or contested. However, since I can only move in cardinal directions (up, down, left, right), I can only clean dirt if I can reach it. I am already at (7, 7), so moving to (7, 8) is one step away — feasible.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawns. Given that the nearest apple is far away and the environment currently has no apples (because the river is dirty), cleaning dirt is a strategic investment in long-term rewards.
- Since I am at (6, 7) and the dirt is at (6, 8), I can move one step north (up) to

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 4). You see agent 2 at (6, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision.

Currently, I am at (6, 4), and I see Agent 2 at (6, 3) — directly above me. This suggests we are in close proximity, possibly in a vertical line, which could be important for coordination or competition.

The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is a distance of 5 units away. That means I would need to move left and up to reach it — a significant journey. The nearest dirt is at (6, 0), which is only 4 units away (down from my current position). Cleaning dirt is essential because apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning that without cleaning dirt, apples won’t appear at all.

But here’s the key trade-off:

- Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately — a direct reward.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but enables future apple spawning — which benefits the group long-term.

However, the apple at (2, 5) is far away, and there's no indication that apples are currently spawning. The presence of dirt at (6, 0) suggests the river is currently dirty — so apples are not spawning. Therefore, **no apples are
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 3). You see agent 1 at (6, 4).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision for maximizing points while supporting the group.

I am at (6, 3), and I see Agent 1 at (6, 4) — directly above me, so we're in the same column. This means we're adjacent and potentially in competition or coordination. The nearest apple is at (2, 1), which is 6 units away — quite far. The nearest dirt is at (6, 0), which is only 3 units away. That’s a key point: dirt is very close, and cleaning it would enable future apple spawning.

Now, the trade-off:

1. **Eating an apple for immediate reward**: The nearest apple is far away (distance 6), and I don’t currently see any apple in my immediate vicinity. There's no indication that an apple has spawned yet — apples only spawn *when the river is clean*. Since the river is currently dirty (as dirt exists), no apples are available. So, I cannot eat an apple right now. Therefore, this option is not viable.

2. **Cleaning dirt to enable future apple spawning**: The dirt at (6, 0) is only 3 units away — very close. Cleaning it
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 8). You see dirt at (6, 8).
  Thinking: I am at (6, 8), and I see dirt at that exact location. The nearest apple is at (1, 8), which is 5 steps away — a significant distance. Right now, there is no apple spawnable because the river is not clean (dirt is present). Apples only spawn when the river is clean, meaning I must first clean the dirt at (6, 8) to enable future apple spawning.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward**:  
   There is no apple at (6, 8). The nearest apple is 5 steps away, and I cannot reach it without first cleaning the dirt. Moreover, eating an apple requires being on land with an apple. Since no apple is currently available at my position, this option is not viable. Even if I moved toward (1, 8), I’d still need to clean dirt first to enable apple spawning — and I don’t know if apples will appear there until the river is clean.

2. **Clean the dirt at (6, 8)**:  
   This is essential. The global scan shows that dirt is at (6, 8), and apples only spawn when the river is clean. Cleaning this dirt

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 3). You see agent 2 at (6, 2).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation and make a strategic decision based on the rules and goals.

Current position: (6, 3)  
Agent 2 is at (6, 2) — directly adjacent, so there's potential for interaction or competition.  
Nearest apple is at (2, 1), which is 6 units away — far and requires significant movement.  
Nearest dirt is at (6, 0), which is only 3 units away — very close and accessible.  

Key rules:  
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.  
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned).  
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but enables future apple spawning.  
- Movement is only allowed in cardinal directions (up/down/left/right), no diagonals.  

Now, evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple immediately?**  
   The nearest apple is at (2, 1), which is 6 steps away. To reach it, you'd need to go left to (6,1), (6,0), then up to (5,0), (4,0), etc. — a long path. Even if you could
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 2). You see agent 1 at (6, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the trade-off carefully given my current position and the global state.

I am at (6, 2), and I see Agent 1 at (6, 3) — directly above me. That means we are aligned vertically, which suggests potential coordination or competition. However, there's no immediate indication that Agent 1 is hostile or blocking me — just presence.

The nearest apple is at (2, 1), which is 5 units away. That’s a significant distance — a long path through potentially dirty terrain. The nearest dirt is at (6, 0), which is only 2 units away from me (down one step). Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning, meaning that without cleaning, apples won’t appear — so dirt cleaning is a prerequisite for future rewards.

Currently, there are no apples visible in my immediate vicinity. The only apple is far away, and the dirt is nearby. 

Now, the key trade-off:

1. **Eat an apple?**  
   There is no apple at my current location. I cannot eat one immediately. The nearest apple is 5 steps away — not accessible without movement. So, eating an apple is not possible now. This option is invalid.

2. **Clean dirt
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 8). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I am at (6, 8). The nearest apple is at (1, 8), which is 5 units away — a manageable distance. The nearest dirt is at (6, 0), 8 units away. 

Right now, there are no visible apples nearby, and I’m not in a position to immediately eat one. However, the global scan shows that apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning. This implies that cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple generation, not a direct reward.

So, let’s analyze the trade-offs:

1. **Eat an apple now?**  
   The apple at (1, 8) is within reach — 5 steps. Eating it would give me +1.0 point immediately. However, if I eat it now, I’m not cleaning dirt, and if the river remains dirty, future apples may not spawn. Since apples are the only source of points, and we are in a cleanup game where long-term sustainability (via clean rivers) enables more apples, I must consider whether immediate gain is worth sacrificing future opportunities.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apples?**  
   Cleaning dirt has no immediate reward, but it enables apples to

--- Step 12 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to determine the best course of action.

Current position: (7, 3)  
Agent 2 is at (7, 2) — directly above me.  
Dirt is at (7, 4) — directly to my right.  
Nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away (distance: 6).  
The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 unit away — very close.  

Key facts:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean. Dirt must be cleaned to allow apples to appear.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but enables future apple spawning — crucial for long-term points.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately, but if the river remains dirty, apples won’t spawn, and future gains are lost.
- There are no apples visible in the immediate vicinity (closest is at (12, 2), far away).
- The dirt is adjacent — only one step away — making it extremely easy to clean.

Trade-off analysis:
1. **Eat an apple?**  
   No apple is available at (7, 3) or nearby. The nearest apple is at (12,

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully.

I am at (7, 2), and I see Agent 1 at (7, 3) — directly above me. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away. The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), just one step above me — a distance of only 2 units. 

Let’s break down the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward**:  
   The apple at (12, 2) is 5 units away — that would require moving right 5 units, which is a long path. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and there’s currently dirt at (7,4), we must first clean it to enable apple spawning. Eating an apple now would only be beneficial if one were already available — but there’s no apple visible at my current position. There's no indication of an apple spawning nearby, and the nearest apple is far away and only possible after cleaning dirt.

2. **Clean the dirt at (7,4)**:  
   This is a critical action. Dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning. The dirt is only 2 units
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away. That means it's not immediately accessible, and even if I were to go there, I'd have to traverse a significant distance without any nearby apples or dirt to clean.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 unit away — very close — and cleaning it would improve the river's cleanliness, which in turn increases the chance of apples spawning in the future. This is a critical prerequisite for apple generation.
- Eating an apple now would give a +1.0 immediate reward, but there are no apples nearby (the nearest is 5 steps away), and there's no indication that apples will spawn in the near future unless the river is cleaned.
- Cleaning dirt does not give immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning — which benefits the group and increases long-term points. Since the goal is to maximize points over time, and apples only spawn when the river is clean, this is a strategic investment.
- There’s no other dirt or apple in close proximity, so exploring further is not urgent or efficient.

Therefore, the optimal action is to clean the dirt at (

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here's the reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible in the immediate vicinity (the nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away), and we are at (7, 3). Eating an apple now would give +1.0 point, but there are no apples at (7, 3) or nearby — so no immediate apple is available to eat.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is very close — only 1 unit away — and cleaning it would improve the river's cleanliness, which is a prerequisite for apples to spawn. This directly supports the long-term goal of enabling apple spawning.
- Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, cleaning dirt is not just a "future" action — it enables the possibility of apples appearing in the future. Given that the nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is quite far, it's likely that the path to it will require clean sections of the river, including areas like (7, 4).
- There is no immediate benefit to eating an apple now — no apple is present at our current position or adjacent land.
- The dirt at (7, 4)

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to determine the best course of action as Agent 2.

Current position: (7, 2)  
Agent 1 is at (7, 3) — directly north, so they are close and possibly in a similar line of action.  
Nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — that’s a fair distance.  
Nearest dirt is at (7, 4), only 2 units away — very close.  

Key point: Apples only spawn when the river is clean. Dirt removal enables apple spawning, but there's no immediate reward for cleaning. However, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apples to appear in the future.  

So, trade-off:
- Option 1: Eat an apple at (12, 2) → +1.0 point immediately.  
  But to reach it, I must move from (7,2) to (12,2), which is 5 steps. The path is along row 2 — likely a straight line.  
  However, the apple doesn't spawn unless the river is clean. Since the nearest dirt is at (7,4), and apples are on land, I must assume the

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away — a significant distance. Eating it would give a +1.0 reward, but it's not immediately accessible or likely to be the only apple available.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 unit away — very close. Cleaning it will improve the river's cleanliness, which directly enables apple spawning on land. This is a critical prerequisite: apples only spawn when the river is clean.
- While cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, it creates long-term value by enabling future apple spawns. Since apples are the only source of points, enabling their spawning is essential for maximizing total score over time.
- There's no immediate benefit to eating an apple now — it's far away and not in a position where it would be sustainable or efficient to reach it without first improving the environment.
- Moving diagonally is not allowed, so movement is constrained to cardinal directions. Cleaning (7, 4) is the most efficient and strategic step — it's adjacent, requires minimal movement, and has high downstream impact.

Therefore, the best action is to clean the dirt at (7,

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 4). You see agent 2 at (6, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the trade-off carefully based on the current situation.

I am at (6, 4), and I see Agent 2 at (6, 3) — directly adjacent, so there's potential for interaction or competition. The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 steps away. The nearest dirt is at (6, 0), which is only 4 steps away. 

Key points:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed). So, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately, which is a direct reward.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward but enables future apple spawns — a long-term benefit.
- I cannot move diagonally, so movement is constrained to cardinal directions.

Now, evaluating the options:

1. **Eat an apple immediately?**  
   The nearest apple is 5 steps away — a significant distance. Since I am already at (6,4), and the apple is at (2,5), I would need to move left and up. But I have no information about whether the apple is currently visible or accessible. More importantly, **apples only spawn when the river

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 3). You see agent 1 at (6, 4).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the trade-off between immediate reward and long-term group benefit.

Currently, I'm at (6, 3), and I see Agent 1 at (6, 4) — directly above me. The nearest apple is at (2, 1), which is 6 units away. That means I'd need to move left and up to reach it. The nearest dirt is at (6, 0), which is only 3 units down from my current position. 

Let’s evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple immediately?**  
   There are no apples in immediate vicinity (within 1 step). The nearest apple is 6 steps away. Eating one now would require significant movement and time, and since apples only spawn when the river is clean, I can't just "eat" one without first enabling its presence. So, **eating an apple now is not possible** — it’s not available.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   This is critical. Dirt cleaning is not rewarded directly, but it enables apples to spawn. The dirt at (6, 0) is only 3 steps away — a very short path. Cleaning it would allow apples to eventually appear in that
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 8). You see dirt at (6, 8).
  Thinking: I am at (6, 8), and I see dirt at that exact location. The nearest apple is at (1, 8), which is 5 units away — a significant distance. Right now, there is no apple visible in my immediate vicinity, and the only available apple is far away. 

The key point is this: **apples only spawn when the river is clean**, meaning dirt must be removed to enable apple spawning. Since there is dirt at (6, 8), and no apples are currently present, I cannot eat an apple immediately — there is no apple at my current position. 

Therefore, **option 1 (eating an apple for immediate reward) is not viable** — no apple is available to eat.

**Option 2 (cleaning dirt to enable future apple spawning)** is both necessary and strategic. By removing the dirt at (6, 8), I contribute to cleaning the environment, which will eventually allow apples to spawn — possibly at (1, 8) or nearby. This action supports the group’s long-term goal of maximizing apple harvests. Even though cleaning gives no immediate reward, it is a prerequisite for future apple availability.

**Option 3 (exploring elsewhere)** is not immediately justified — there is

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 3). You see agent 2 at (6, 2).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 0), even though it doesn't provide immediate reward.

Here's why:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 1), which is 6 units away — a significant distance. There's no nearby apple (within 1 or 2 steps), so eating one now would be inefficient and not optimal for long-term goals.
- The dirt at (6, 0) is only 3 units away — very close — and cleaning it directly supports the core game mechanic: cleaner river → more apples spawn. This is a necessary prerequisite for apple spawning.
- Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and we have no apples currently spawning (implied by the lack of nearby apples), cleaning dirt is a foundational step to enable future apple growth.
- Agent 2 is at (6, 2), which is adjacent to the dirt at (6, 0) — suggesting coordination or potential conflict. If we don’t act now, agent 2 might clean it first and gain an advantage. By acting now, I secure the opportunity to enable future apple spawning and potentially outpace agent 2 in long-term progress.
- There's no immediate reward for eating an apple here — and since apples are far

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 2). You see agent 1 at (6, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am at (6, 2), and I see Agent 1 at (6, 3) — they are directly above me, so we're adjacent. The nearest apple is at (2, 1), which is 5 steps away. That’s a significant distance. The nearest dirt is at (6, 0), which is only 2 steps away — very close.

Key rules:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned).
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but enables future apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.
- I cannot move diagonally — so movement is restricted to cardinal directions.

Now, evaluate the trade-offs:

1. **Eat an apple?**  
   The nearest apple is 5 steps away — I would need to move through potentially dirty terrain to reach it. But if the river is not clean (which it currently isn’t, since dirt exists), no apples spawn. So unless the dirt is cleaned, I cannot even access apples. Therefore, I cannot eat an apple *now* because the apple at (2,1) won’t spawn until the river
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Moving from (6, 8) towards (1, 8).
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 8). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I am at (6, 8). The nearest apple is at (1, 8), which is 5 units away — a reasonable distance to reach via movement (moving left along row 8). The nearest dirt is at (6, 0), 8 units away, which is farther than the apple. 

Let’s analyze the trade-offs:

1. **Eating an apple for immediate reward**:  
   Apples give +1.0 point each. Since the apple at (1,8) is within reach and there's no immediate danger or obstacle, I can reach it in 5 moves (left 5 times). This would give me a direct, tangible reward. However, apples only spawn *when the river is clean*. That means apples are not guaranteed — they depend on dirt being cleaned. So if I eat an apple now, I'm consuming a reward that may not be sustainable long-term if the river remains dirty.

2. **Cleaning dirt to enable future apple spawning**:  
   Cleaning dirt is not rewarding immediately, but it's essential for enabling apples to spawn. Since the nearest dirt is at (6,0), and I’m at (6,8), I can move down to (6,0) in 8

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 2). You see agent 2 at (6, 1).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am at (6, 2), and I see Agent 2 at (6, 1). The nearest apple is at (2, 1), which is 5 steps away — a significant distance. The nearest dirt is at (6, 0), just one step away (distance 2). 

Key facts:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned).
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but enables future apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.
- I cannot move diagonally, so movement is constrained to cardinal directions.

Now, the trade-off:

1. **Eat an apple?**  
   The nearest apple is far away (distance 5), and I have no apple in immediate range. Eating one would require me to go to (2,1), which is not feasible without cleaning first or moving through other areas. Since no apple is visible or reachable immediately, and I'm not near any apple spawn point, eating one now would be inefficient and not optimal.

2. **Clean dirt?**  
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 4). You see agent 2 at (6, 3).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 0) to improve the river's cleanliness and enable future apple spawning.

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away — a significant distance. Eating it would give +1.0 immediately, but it's not close enough to be practical or efficient in the short term.
- The nearest dirt is at (6, 0), only 4 units away from my current position (6, 4). This is within easy reach and represents a high-impact action.
- Dirt cleaning is not rewarding in itself, but it enables apple spawning. Since apples only appear when the river is clean, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple generation — a critical long-term strategy.
- The presence of Agent 2 at (6, 3) suggests potential coordination or competition. However, there's no indication of conflict or threat, so I should focus on contributing to the group's success rather than reacting defensively.
- Moving to (6, 0) to clean dirt is a direct, low-risk action that increases the chances of future apple spawns. This supports the group's overall goal of maximizing points over time.
- Without cleaning dirt, apples will not spawn
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 3). You see agent 1 at (6, 4).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision for maximizing points while supporting the group.

Current position: (6, 3)  
Agent 1 is at (6, 4) — directly above me, so we're in the same column.  
Nearest apple is at (2, 1), which is 6 units away (a long path).  
Nearest dirt is at (6, 0), which is 3 units away — very close.  

Key considerations:

1. **Immediate reward (eating an apple)**:  
   The nearest apple is far away (distance 6), and there are no apples visible nearby. Eating an apple now would require moving to (2,1), which is inefficient and likely not worth it if no apples are immediately available. Moreover, apples only spawn when the river is clean — so even if I eat one, it won't help the long-term goal unless we clean dirt first.

2. **Cleaning dirt to enable future apple spawning**:  
   Dirt at (6,0) is only 3 units away — very close. Cleaning it would reduce dirt on the river, which increases the chance of apples spawning in the future. Since apples are the only source of points, and they
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 8). You see dirt at (6, 8).
  Thinking: I am at (6, 8), and there is dirt directly at my current position. The nearest apple is at (1, 8), which is 5 steps away — a reasonable distance but not immediate. The key point is that **apples only spawn on land when the river is clean**, meaning that dirt must be cleaned to enable apple growth.

Right now, I am standing on dirt. That means I cannot eat an apple here, and the land is not yet suitable for apple spawning. Since the nearest apple is 5 steps away and requires a clean path to reach, I must first consider whether I should clean the dirt at (6,8) to enable future apple spawning.

Let’s analyze the trade-offs:

1. **Eat an apple immediately?**  
   → No apple is available at (6,8). I am standing on dirt, which is not apple terrain. There is no apple in my immediate vicinity. Therefore, I cannot eat one now. This option is invalid.

2. **Clean the dirt at (6,8)?**  
   → This action is necessary. Cleaning dirt enables the river to become clean, which increases the chance of apples spawning on adjacent land. Even though cleaning gives no immediate reward, it is a

--- Step 13 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 3). You see agent 2 at (6, 2).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 0) to improve the river's cleanliness and enable future apple spawning.

Here’s the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 1), which is 6 units away — far beyond immediate reach. Eating it would give only +1.0 point, but it's not practical or efficient given the distance and the fact that apples only spawn when the river is clean.
- The nearest dirt is at (6, 0), just 3 units away — very close and accessible. Cleaning dirt has no immediate reward, but it directly improves the environment by reducing pollution in the river, which increases the chance of apples spawning in the future.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean. Therefore, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apple generation. Without cleaning, even if we move toward apples, they won’t appear.
- Since I am at (6, 3), moving to (6, 0) is straightforward (down 3 units, no diagonal movement), and it's a strategic investment in long-term sustainability.
- Agent 2 is at (6, 2), which is directly adjacent — they may be doing similar work, but without coordinated action, both agents could waste effort. However
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 2). You see agent 1 at (6, 3).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to determine the best course of action as Agent 2.

Current position: (6, 2)  
Agent 1 is at (6, 3) — directly above me, so we're adjacent. This means we're in close proximity, which could be important for coordination or competition.

Global scan:
- Nearest apple is at (2, 1), distance = 5 steps.
- Nearest dirt is at (6, 0), distance = 2 steps.

Key considerations:

1. **Eating an apple for immediate reward (+1.0)**  
   The apple at (2, 1) is 5 steps away — quite far. Given that I'm already at (6, 2), and the nearest dirt is only 2 steps away (at (6, 0)), it would take at least 2 steps to reach the dirt. But to eat an apple, I’d have to walk 5 steps to (2, 1) — a significant effort with no immediate benefit if I don’t get a clean river. Moreover, apples only spawn when the river is clean. So even if I eat one, it’s not sustainable or strategic unless I can get more apples later
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 8). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: Given the current situation, let's analyze the trade-offs carefully.

You are at (6, 8). The nearest apple is at (1, 8), which is 5 units away — a reasonable distance, but not immediate. The nearest dirt is at (6, 0), 8 units away. This dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning, which is essential for long-term rewards.

**Option 1: Eat an apple for immediate reward**  
- Immediate gain: +1.0 point.  
- Risk: The apple at (1, 8) is only 5 steps away — you can reach it in a straight line (leftward movement).  
- However, if you eat it now, you consume a valuable resource that could be used to support future apple spawns. More importantly, apples only spawn *when the river is clean*. If you don’t clean the dirt at (6, 0), apples will not spawn at all — meaning future apple opportunities are blocked.  
- Eating an apple now gives a short-term gain but may prevent future opportunities.

**Option 2: Clean dirt to enable future apple spawns**  
- No immediate reward.  
- But cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apple spawning. Without cleaning, no

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 2). You see agent 2 at (6, 1).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the trade-off carefully based on the current situation and long-term goals.

Currently, I am at (6, 2), and I see Agent 2 at (6, 1). The nearest apple is at (2, 1), which is 5 units away — quite a distance. The nearest dirt is at (6, 0), just 2 units away, meaning it's directly below me. Cleaning this dirt would be a short, efficient action that could enable future apple spawning when the river becomes clean.

However, eating an apple gives immediate +1.0 points, which is valuable for personal score. But apples only spawn when the river is clean — so if I don’t clean dirt, no apples will appear. Since apples are currently not spawning (due to dirty river), the only way to get apples is to clean dirt first, then apples can spawn at locations like (2, 1) when conditions are met.

Right now, there are no apples visible — the nearest apple is at (2, 1), but it's not currently spawning because the river is dirty. Therefore, eating an apple is not possible right now — no apple is available to eat. The only available action is to clean dirt.

- Since apples spawn *when the river is clean*, and we already have an apple, we are already in a state where apples can spawn. Therefore, the immediate action of eating the apple provides a
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 2, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 8). You see dirt at (7, 8).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7,8).

Here’s the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (1,8), which is 5 units away. To reach it, I’d need to move through multiple tiles, and there’s no indication that any apples are currently spawning or available in the immediate vicinity.
- The dirt at (7,8) is only 1 unit away — extremely close. Cleaning it is a low-effort, high-impact action that directly contributes to the river being cleaner.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean. By removing dirt, I enable the possibility of apple spawning in the future — which benefits the group and increases the total apple yield over time.
- Eating an apple now would give me +1.0 immediately, but it would be a wasted opportunity if it doesn’t lead to more apples later. Since there are no apples visible near me, and the only apple is far away (at (1,8)), I have no immediate access to one.
- Cleaning dirt is not rewarding in isolation, but it is essential for enabling future apple growth. Given that the dirt is adjacent and easily accessible, this is a strategic, long-term investment.
- There is no indication of other dirt or apple clusters nearby

--- Step 14 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 7). You see dirt at (7, 8) and agent 3 at (7, 8).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 8).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 6 steps away. That means it's not immediately accessible — and more importantly, apples only spawn *when the river is clean*. Currently, there is dirt at (7, 8), which blocks apple spawning.
- The dirt at (7, 8) is only 1 step away from my current position (7, 7). This is extremely close and makes cleaning it a low-effort, high-impact action.
- Eating an apple now would give a +1.0 reward, but there are no apples visible in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is far away, and it will not spawn unless the dirt is cleaned.
- Cleaning the dirt is a prerequisite for apple spawning. Without cleaning, apples won’t appear — meaning I can’t gain any apples in the future, regardless of how far they are.
- Since the dirt is right next to me and agent 3 is already at (7, 8), I must consider whether agent 3 is also trying to clean or is just standing there. But the presence of agent 3 doesn’t change the fact that dirt must be
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 8}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 0). You see an apple at (2, 1).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (2, 1).

Here's the reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only 1 step away — this is a direct, no-risk opportunity for a +1.0 point reward.
- There is no immediate benefit to cleaning dirt at (7, 8), which is 13 steps away. The global scan shows that apples only spawn when the river is clean, but that clean state is not currently achievable without significant movement and effort. Since no apples are currently spawning, and we don’t know if the dirt at (7,8) is the only source, cleaning it now would be a long-term, uncertain investment with no immediate payoff.
- The goal is to maximize points — and in this scenario, we have a tangible, accessible reward right in front of us.
- There’s no indication that future apple spawns depend on immediate actions. Without a clear link between cleaning dirt and immediate apple availability, and given the distance, it’s irrational to sacrifice an immediate +1.0 point for a speculative future gain.

Therefore, the optimal decision is to eat the apple at (2, 1) now. This maximizes immediate points and aligns with the goal of maximizing score in a situation where no immediate environmental
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 2, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 8). You see agent 1 at (7, 7) and dirt at (7, 8).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 8), and I see dirt directly at my position — (7, 8). This dirt is the nearest dirt globally, with a distance of 0. The nearest apple is at (1, 8), which is 6 units away. 

Currently, there are no apples visible in my immediate vicinity. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning, dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning. Since I am standing on dirt, I cannot eat an apple right now. Eating an apple is not possible unless there is one present on land, and currently, no apple is visible at (7, 8) or nearby.

Therefore, **option 1 (eating an apple)** is not viable — there is no apple available to eat at this moment.

**Option 2 (cleaning dirt)** is both necessary and logical. Cleaning the dirt at (7, 8) will improve the river’s cleanliness, which increases the chance of apples spawning in the future — especially since the nearest apple is at (1, 8), which is on the same row (row 8), and potentially within reach once the land becomes cleaner.

Even though cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, it is a prerequisite for

--- Step 15 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 7). You see agent 3 at (7, 8).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

Current position: (7, 7)  
Agent 3 is at (7, 8) — directly north, so they're in close proximity.  
Nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 6 units east — a moderate distance.  
Global scan shows: **No dirt found** in the global scan.

This is critical. **Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean** — meaning, dirt must be cleaned *before* apples can appear. Since there is **no dirt detected globally**, it implies that either:
- Dirt is not currently visible in the scan (perhaps hidden or far away), or
- The river is currently clean (no dirt), so apples are already possible to spawn — but only on land that is currently clean.

But here's the key: **Apples only spawn when the river is clean**. If there is no dirt, the river is clean — so apples *can* spawn. However, the global scan says "No dirt found," which suggests the environment is currently clean.

So, the trade-off becomes:

1. **Eat an apple** → Immediate +1.0 reward.  
   - The apple at (13,7
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 13, 'coord_y': 7}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 1). You see an apple at (2, 1).
  Thinking: The current observation shows that there is an apple directly at (2, 1), and I am already at that location. The distance to the apple is 0, meaning I can immediately eat it and gain +1.0 point. 

Additionally, the global scan indicates that there is **no nearby dirt** to clean. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), and there is currently no dirt to clean, there is **no immediate benefit to cleaning** — it won’t enable future apple spawning in this scenario. 

Therefore, the trade-off analysis is:

- **Eating the apple now** gives immediate +1.0 point and is both possible and optimal given the current state.
- **Cleaning dirt** would be beneficial only if dirt were present — which it isn’t — so it’s not a viable action at this time.
- There is no need to explore elsewhere, as the apple is already in reach.

**Conclusion**: I should eat the apple at (2, 1) for the immediate reward. This maximizes my score with no risk or wasted effort. Cleaning dirt is not necessary now, and no other apples or dirt are available to act upon. 

  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation and make a strategic decision based on the game rules and current state.

Currently, I am at (7, 3). Agent 2 is at (7, 2), directly above me, and there is dirt at (7, 4), directly to my right. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — a significant distance. The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 unit away, meaning it's very close and immediately accessible.

Key points:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed). So, if I don't clean the dirt at (7, 4), no apples will spawn in that area — which could deprive the group of future rewards.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately, but apples only appear when the river is clean. Since there is no apple currently visible in the immediate vicinity, and the nearest apple is far away (6 units), there is no apple I can eat right now.
- Therefore, the immediate action of "eating an apple" is not possible — no apple is present at my current location or nearby.
- Cleaning the dirt at (7,
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am at (7, 2), and I see Agent 1 at (7, 3) — directly above me. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away. That means I would need to move right to (12, 2) to reach it, which is a reasonable distance but not immediate.

The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), which is just one step above me — distance 2. Cleaning dirt is essential because apples only spawn when the river is clean. However, cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward — it's a prerequisite for future apple spawning.

Now, let’s assess the trade-off:

1. **Eat an apple now?**  
   The nearest apple is 5 steps away. I don’t have any apples nearby (no apple in immediate vicinity), and there's no indication of apple spawn at (7, 2) or (7, 3). Eating an apple would require movement to (12, 2), which is far and would take time. Also, if I go to eat an apple now, I’m leaving the dirt at (7, 4) unclean
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away. That means I would need to travel through several tiles to reach it, and there’s no immediate access to an apple.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 tile away — very close — and cleaning it directly contributes to improving the river's cleanliness. This increases the chance of apples spawning in the future, especially since apples only spawn when the river is clean.
- Eating an apple now would give a +1.0 reward, but there are no apples visible in immediate proximity. The apple at (2, 5) is far away, and without first cleaning dirt, the river remains dirty, which prevents apples from spawning at all.
- The game mechanics explicitly state that apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Therefore, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple generation.
- Since I cannot move diagonally, the path to (2, 5) would require going through other tiles, many of which may still be dirty. Cleaning (7, 4) first ensures that future apple spawns are possible and increases the long-term potential for rewards.

Thus,

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the current situation to make the best decision.

Current position: (7, 3)  
Agent 2 is at (7, 2) — directly above me, so they're in close proximity.  
There is dirt at (7, 4) — directly to my right, just one step away.  
The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 steps away.  
The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), only 1 step away.

Now, evaluating the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward**  
   - There is no apple visible at my current position. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is far away.  
   - Eating an apple would require reaching it, which takes multiple moves and time.  
   - There's no immediate apple available. So, no immediate benefit from this option.

2. **Clean the dirt at (7, 4)**  
   - This is the closest dirt (distance 1), so it's very accessible.  
   - Cleaning dirt doesn’t give immediate points, but it enables apples to spawn in the future — which benefits the group.  
   - Since apples only spawn when

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4) to enable future apple spawning.

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away. That means I'd need to move through several tiles to reach it — a significant distance with no immediate reward.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), just one tile away from my current position (7, 2). Cleaning it is a simple, immediate action that has no cost and directly contributes to the global goal of making the river clean.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean. So, by cleaning dirt, I'm enabling the potential for apples to appear in the future — especially in areas like (12, 2) that are currently unreachable due to dirty conditions.
- There's no immediate reward for eating an apple now (since it's far away and not spawnable yet), and I cannot move diagonally — so I would have to take a long path to reach it.
- Cleaning dirt is a necessary precondition for apple spawning. Without it, future apple access is blocked, even if they're nearby.

Therefore, the optimal strategy is to clean the dirt at (7, 4). This action:
-
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: Given the current situation, let's analyze the trade-off carefully.

You are at (7, 5), and there is dirt at (7, 4) — just one step away. The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 steps away. That means apples are not immediately accessible. Importantly, **apples only spawn when the river is clean**, and cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning. This implies that **eating an apple now is not possible**, since no apple is in immediate range, and the apple at (2,5) is too far to reach without first ensuring the environment is clean.

Moreover, the dirt at (7,4) is adjacent — a simple, low-effort action to clean. Cleaning it would improve the river's cleanliness, which in turn increases the chance of apples spawning in the future — especially in areas like (2,5), which is currently unreachable due to dirt blocking the spawning condition.

Even though eating an apple gives a +1.0 immediate reward, **no apple is currently available** to eat. There is no apple at (7,4) or nearby. Therefore, attempting to eat an apple now would be futile.

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to determine the best course of action.

Current position: (7, 3)  
Agent 2 is at (7, 2) — directly above me, so we're in the same column.  
Dirt is at (7, 4) — directly to my right (east), just one step away.  
Nearest apple is at (12, 2), 6 steps away — which is far, but reachable.  
The dirt at (7, 4) is very close — only 1 distance unit away.

Now, evaluating the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple visible in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 steps away — not within reach. Eating an apple would require movement to that location, and there's no apple at (7, 3) or nearby. So, no immediate apple is available to eat. This option is not viable.

2. **Clean the dirt at (7, 4)?**  
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away. To reach it, I’d need to move through multiple tiles, and currently, there is no indication that apples are spawning because the river is dirty. Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning when dirt is removed.
- There is dirt directly at (7, 4), just one step away. This is the nearest dirt, so cleaning it is both efficient and impactful.
- Cleaning dirt provides no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning. Since apples are the only source of points (+1.0 each), and they are currently not spawning due to dirt, cleaning is a necessary precondition for earning apples.
- Eating an apple now would require traveling to (2, 5), which is far away, and there’s no guarantee that apples would be available there — especially if the river remains dirty. Moreover, without cleaning, future apple spawns are blocked.
- The trade-off is between immediate reward and long-term sustainability. Since no apples are currently spawning (due to dirt), and the dirt is very close, cleaning it is a strategic investment in future rewards.
- Even if I don

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — quite far, and currently unreachable due to the dirt blocking the path.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 unit away from my current position (7, 3), meaning it’s immediately accessible.
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — this means cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple generation. Without cleaning, no apples will appear, even if I move far.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0, but there are no apples visible in the immediate vicinity. There is no apple at (7, 3) or nearby. The nearest apple is distant and dependent on clean land.
- Cleaning dirt does not give immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning — which benefits both myself and the group. Since apples are the only source of points, and they are currently unavailable due to dirt, this action is essential for long-term progress.
- I cannot move diagonally, so I must move one step at a time. Moving to (7, 4) to clean it is the only viable immediate action that advances the
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am at (7, 2), and I see Agent 1 at (7, 3). The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — that's a considerable distance. The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), which is just 2 units away. That means I can reach the dirt in one move (up from (7, 2) to (7, 3), then to (7, 4)), and cleaning it would help enable future apple spawning.

But I have to consider the trade-off:

1. **Eating an apple** gives +1.0 immediately. However, there is no apple in immediate vicinity — the nearest is 5 units away. I cannot eat it without moving. So, eating an apple now is not possible.

2. **Cleaning dirt** gives no immediate reward, but it's essential for future apple spawning. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when there's less dirt), removing dirt enables apples to appear. This is a long-term benefit for the group.

3. **Exploration** — the nearest apple is at (12,

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Reasoning:

- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Right now, there is dirt at (7, 4), which is blocking apple spawning in that area. Since the nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away, and we are currently at (7, 5), we are not in immediate proximity to an apple — and more importantly, no apple can spawn at all if there's dirt on the land.

- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 point, but there is no apple visible at our current position. The nearest apple is at (2,5), which is 5 steps away, and we would need to move there first — but without cleaning the dirt at (7,4), the land around the river remains dirty, and apples will not spawn even if we reach that location.

- Cleaning the dirt at (7,4) is a necessary step to enable future apple spawning. Even though it gives no immediate reward, it directly contributes to the long-term goal of enabling apple growth. This action supports the group's objective and increases the potential for future rewards.

- There is no nearby apple to eat, and no

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here's my reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — a significant distance. Eating it immediately would give only +1.0 point, but it's not in immediate reach and may not be the most strategic move given the environmental constraints.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 unit away — very close. Cleaning it would improve the river's cleanliness, which in turn increases the chance of apples spawning in the future. This is a long-term investment in the group's ability to gather apples.
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Without cleaning dirt, no apples will appear, regardless of how far you walk. Therefore, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for any future apple harvesting.
- Since I cannot move diagonally, movement is constrained to cardinal directions. From (7, 3), moving to (7, 4) to clean the dirt is a simple, one-step action with no risk or cost.
- There's no immediate apple nearby to justify eating one now — the nearest apple is far away, and the current environment is barren due to dirt.

Therefore, the trade-off favors cleaning

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision for maximizing points and contributing to the group's success.

Current position: (7, 2)  
Agent 1 is at (7, 3) — directly above me, so we're in the same column.  
Nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 steps away — on the same row, so a straightforward path.  
Nearest dirt is at (7, 4), which is just one step above me — distance 2, meaning it's very close and easily reachable.

Key trade-offs:

1. **Eat an apple now?**  
   - Immediate reward: +1.0 point.  
   - But the apple at (12, 2) is 5 steps away — not close.  
   - If I eat an apple now, I consume a valuable resource that might otherwise be used to clean dirt or move toward apples.  
   - More importantly, apples only spawn when the river is clean. So if I don’t clean dirt, no apples will spawn in the future — which means future apple spawns are blocked.  
   - Since the nearest dirt is only 2 steps away, cleaning it would enable future apple spawning
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here’s the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away. That means it's not immediately accessible, and even if I were to go there, I’d have to traverse a long path. Eating an apple now would give me +1.0 point, but it would be a short-term gain with no guarantee of future rewards.
  
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 unit away — very close. Cleaning it would improve the river’s cleanliness, which increases the chance of apples spawning in the future. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, this action directly enables future apple generation. This supports the group’s long-term goal of maximizing apple collection.

- There is no immediate apple nearby, and the dirt is adjacent. The trade-off between immediate reward and long-term benefit is clear: cleaning dirt is a necessary prerequisite for apples to appear. Without cleaning, no apples will spawn, regardless of how far away they are.

- Without cleaning, apples will not spawn — meaning no apples
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 8}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 0). You see an apple at (2, 1).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (2, 1).

Reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only 1 step away — this is a direct, tangible +1.0 reward with no risk or cost.
- There is no immediate benefit to cleaning dirt at (7, 8), which is 13 steps away. The global scan shows no nearby dirt, and cleaning it would require significant movement with no guaranteed apple spawn until later. Given the current state, there is no urgent need to clean dirt — it's not in the immediate vicinity or in a critical area.
- Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and we don’t currently have a clean river (no visible clean zones), the long-term benefit of cleaning dirt is speculative and delayed. Without any nearby dirt or a clear path to it, the priority should be to maximize immediate reward.
- The agent has no other resources or constraints (like health or time), and the only action that yields a reward is eating an apple.

Therefore, eating the apple at (2, 1) is the optimal choice — it provides immediate value, aligns with the goal of maximizing points, and doesn't compromise future potential (since the dirt is far away and not currently impacting apple availability).
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 2, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 8). You see agent 1 at (7, 7) and dirt at (7, 8).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 8), directly adjacent to dirt at (7, 8), and I see Agent 1 at (7, 7). The nearest apple is at (1, 8), which is 6 steps away — a significant distance. There is currently no apple spawning because the river is not clean (dirt exists). Apples only spawn when the river is clean, meaning that cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apple availability.

Right now, there are no apples visible nearby, and the only apple in range is far away. Eating an apple would give me +1.0 point, but since no apple is currently available at my position, I cannot eat one. The dirt at (7, 8) must be cleaned to enable future apple spawning — and this is essential for the group's long-term success.

Cleaning dirt does not give immediate reward, but it enables future apple generation. Without cleaning, even if I move toward (1, 8), there will be no apples to eat. Therefore, the immediate action must be to clean the dirt at (7, 8), which is right where I am.

After cleaning, I can then proceed to explore toward the nearest apple at (1, 8), which is on

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 7). You see agent 3 at (7, 8).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

You are at (7, 7). Agent 3 is at (7, 8) — directly adjacent, so there's a potential for interaction or coordination, though it's not clear if that's relevant yet.

### Key Observations:
- **Nearest Apple**: at (13, 7), distance = 6. This is a significant distance, but it's on the same row (row 7), which means you can move horizontally toward it.
- **Nearest Dirt**: "None found" in the global scan. This is critical. Dirt is the only thing that prevents apples from spawning. Since there is *no dirt* in the current scan, the river is already clean — meaning apples *can* spawn now, without needing to clean anything.
- **Apple reward**: Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately. This is a direct, tangible reward.
- **Cleaning dirt**: Only useful if dirt exists. Since no dirt is found, cleaning is not needed and would be a wasted action.

### Trade-off Analysis:
1. **Eat an apple now?**  
   Yes — because apples *are* spawning (river is clean), and there is a reachable apple at (13,
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 13, 'coord_y': 7}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 1). You see an apple at (2, 1).
  Thinking: I am at (2, 1), and there is an apple directly at my current position — distance 0. This means I can immediately eat it and gain +1.0 point. 

Looking at the global scan, there is **no dirt nearby** — meaning there is no dirt to clean. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when there is dirt to clean), and no dirt exists currently, there is **no immediate benefit to cleaning** — no future apples can spawn because there's nothing to clean.

Therefore:
- **Option 1 (eat the apple)**: Immediate reward of +1.0. There is no cost, and no future apple spawning is dependent on action since no dirt exists. This is safe and beneficial.
- **Option 2 (clean dirt)**: Not applicable — no dirt is present. Cleaning would be futile and unproductive.
- **Option 3 (explore)**: There is no nearby dirt or unknown areas to explore. The apple is already at my location, and no further action is needed to enable future apple spawning.

**Conclusion**: I should eat the apple at (2, 1) for immediate reward. There is no strategic need to clean dirt (none exists),
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 2, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'eat'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 8). You see agent 1 at (7, 7).
  Thinking: The current observation shows that I am at (7, 8), and I see Agent 1 at (7, 7). The global scan reveals that the nearest apple is at (1, 8), which is 6 units away — a significant distance. Importantly, there is **no dirt** listed in the global scan, meaning there is currently no dirt to clean.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward**  
   - There is an apple at (1, 8), but it is 6 units away. I am currently at (7, 8), so I would need to move left to reach it.  
   - However, the apple is not immediately accessible. Moving to (1, 8) would require traversing a large horizontal distance.  
   - Since no dirt exists, cleaning dirt is not possible — and thus, no future apple spawning is enabled.  
   - **Immediate reward is not viable** without first ensuring access or enabling conditions.

2. **Clean dirt to ensure future apples spawn**  
   - There is no dirt in the global scan. This suggests that either dirt is not present, or it is hidden in a region not yet scanned.  
   - Since cleaning

Moving from (8, 7) towards (13, 7).
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 7). You see agent 3 at (7, 8).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

You are currently at (8, 7).  
You see Agent 3 at (7, 8).  
The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 5 units away — that’s a moderate distance.  
The global scan says: **"Nearest Dirt: None found."** This is critical.  

This means there is **no dirt** in the current environment to clean. Therefore, **cleaning dirt is not possible right now** — it’s not a viable action.  

So, the options are:

1. **Eat an apple** — immediate +1.0 reward.  
   - The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 5 steps away.  
   - You can reach it via (8,7) → (9,7) → (10,7) → (11,7) → (12,7) → (13,7).  
   - This requires moving 5 steps.  
   - Since there's no dirt to clean, there’s no immediate benefit to cleaning — it can't spawn apples now.  
   - So, if you don’t clean, apples won’t spawn — but

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 1). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: Given the current observation and global scan, let's analyze the situation carefully.

You are at (2, 1).  
The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 4 units away — a moderate distance.  
Crucially, the global scan indicates **no dirt is found nearby**. This is significant because:

- Apples **only spawn on land when the river is clean** (i.e., when dirt is removed).
- Currently, there is **no dirt to clean**, so there is **no immediate benefit to cleaning** — no apples can spawn yet.
- Therefore, **cleaning dirt is not currently actionable** or beneficial, since there's nothing to clean.

Now, evaluating the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 4 steps away. You currently see nothing of interest nearby, and there’s no dirt to clean.  
   → Since apples only spawn *when the river is clean*, and we have no dirt to clean, **no apples are currently available**.  

--- Step 14 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 2). You see agent 2 at (6, 1).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to determine the best course of action.

Current position: (6, 2)  
Agent 2 is at (6, 1) — directly adjacent, possibly a potential coordination point or threat.  
Nearest Apple: (2, 1), distance = 5 steps.  
Nearest Dirt: (6, 0), distance = 2 steps.  

Key considerations:

1. **Immediate reward vs. long-term benefit**:  
   - Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately.  
   - However, apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is removed).  
   - Right now, there is dirt at (6,0), just 2 steps away.  
   - Cleaning dirt is not rewarding in itself, but it enables future apple spawning — which benefits the group.  
   - Since apples are currently far away (5 steps to (2,1)), and the river is currently dirty (blocking apple spawning), cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for any future apple access.  

2. **Is there a trade-off between eating now or cleaning?**  
   - Eating an apple now gives immediate +1.0, but if the river remains dirty, no more apples will

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 1). You see dirt at (6, 0) and agent 1 at (6, 2).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 0).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 1), which is 4 units away — quite far, and there's no immediate apple in sight. Eating an apple now would give +1.0 point, but it would require moving to a location where an apple is already present, which isn't currently accessible due to the dirt blocking the path to clean land.
- The dirt at (6, 0) is only 1 unit away — very close. Cleaning it will make the land at (6, 0) clean, which increases the chance of apples spawning in that area or nearby. Since apples only spawn on clean land, this action directly enables future apple generation.
- There is an agent (Agent 1) at (6, 2), which is adjacent to the dirt at (6, 0). If Agent 1 is also working on cleaning or collecting, coordination could be beneficial. However, since we don’t have information about their actions or intentions, we should focus on maximizing our own contribution to the system.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it is a necessary precondition for apple spawning. Without cleaning, apples won’t appear — even if

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 7). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision as Agent 3.

Currently, I am at (6, 7). The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 units away. The nearest dirt is at (6, 0), 7 units away. Since I can't move diagonally, I must move in cardinal directions only — up, down, left, or right.

**Option 1: Eat an apple for immediate reward**  
- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 steps away.  
- However, apples only spawn *when the river is clean* — meaning dirt must be cleaned first.  
- Right now, there is dirt at (6, 0), which is 7 units away. That dirt is not currently affecting the apple at (2, 5), but if the river is not clean, apples may not spawn at all.  
- If I eat an apple now, I get +1.0, but only if the apple exists and is accessible.  
- But if the apple at (2, 5) is not spawnable due to dirty river conditions, then eating it might not be possible — or it might not even exist

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 1). You see dirt at (6, 0) and agent 2 at (6, 0).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 0).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 1), which is 4 units away. That means I would need to travel at least 4 steps to reach it — a significant distance, especially if I have to navigate through potentially dirty terrain or avoid obstacles.
- However, the dirt at (6, 0) is directly adjacent to my current position (6, 1), meaning I can clean it in one move.
- Cleaning dirt does not give immediate reward, but it is essential for enabling apple spawning. The rule states that apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — so cleaning dirt enables future apple generation.
- There is already an agent (agent 2) at (6, 0), which suggests this location might be a key point of interest or conflict. If I clean the dirt, I'm not just helping the group — I'm enabling future apple spawns that could benefit multiple agents, including myself.
- Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and the dirt is currently blocking apple spawning, cleaning it is a prerequisite for future apple access. Without it, even if I go to (2, 1), there's no guarantee apples will

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 0). You see dirt at (6, 0) and agent 1 at (6, 1).
  Thinking: I am at (6, 0), directly on a dirt patch, and I see Agent 1 at (6, 1). The nearest apple is at (1, 0), which is 5 units away — a significant distance. Right now, there is no apple at my current location, and the only dirt visible is at (6, 0), which is right where I am.

Let’s break down the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There is no apple at (6, 0). I cannot eat an apple here. The nearest apple is at (1, 0), which is far away and not immediately accessible. Eating an apple would require moving to a location with one, and since we don’t have one now, this option is not viable.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   → Yes. Dirt cleaning is essential for apples to spawn. Currently, there is dirt at (6, 0), and since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt), cleaning this dirt would reduce the dirt count and increase the chance of apples appearing in the future.  
   → Even though cleaning gives no immediate reward, it is a

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 6). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 0), even though it doesn't provide immediate reward.

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away — a significant distance. Eating it now would give only +1.0 point, but it's not in immediate reach.
- The dirt at (6, 0) is 6 units away, which is close to the current position (6,6). Moving to (6,0) requires only a vertical descent — a straightforward path (no diagonal movement needed).
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean, meaning dirt must be removed to enable apple generation. Cleaning dirt is not rewarding immediately, but it enables future apple spawning — which benefits the entire group.
- Since there's no visible nearby apple or interest, and the nearest apple is far away, the strategic value of enabling future apple spawns outweighs the immediate gain of eating a distant apple.
- If we don't clean the dirt, no apples will spawn in that area, and the group will be unable to access future rewards. This is a long-term investment in sustainability.

Therefore, the optimal action is to move to (6, 0) and clean the dirt. This

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 1). You see agent 2 at (6, 0).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

You are at (6, 1), and agent 2 is at (6, 0) — directly below you, adjacent. There's no dirt in the global scan, which means there is currently no dirt to clean. That's a critical point: **cleaning dirt is required to enable apple spawning**, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt has been removed).

The nearest apple is at (2, 1), which is 4 units away — a significant distance. Since you cannot move diagonally, you’d need to move leftward across the grid to reach it. But here's the key: **apples only spawn when dirt is cleaned**, and currently, there is *no dirt* in the global scan. That suggests the river is already clean, or at least, no dirt is available to be cleaned.

So, is there dirt to clean?

The global scan says: "Nearest Dirt: None found." This implies that **there is currently no dirt to clean** — meaning the river is clean, and therefore apples *can* spawn.

But — the question is: should you eat an apple now?

Let’s evaluate the options:

   The nearest dirt is at (6, 0), only 2
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 1). You see dirt at (6, 0) and agent 1 at (6, 2).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 0).

Reasoning:

- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Right now, there is dirt at (6, 0), which is directly adjacent to my position at (6, 1). This dirt is blocking apple spawning in that area.
- The nearest apple is at (2, 1), which is 4 units away — quite far. Eating it would give +1.0 point, but it requires moving through potentially dirty or uncleaned terrain.
- However, cleaning dirt does not give immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning. Since apples are the only source of points, enabling their spawning is essential for long-term scoring.
- Agent 1 is at (6, 2), which is just above the dirt at (6, 0), suggesting they may also be aware of the dirt. If we both clean the dirt, it increases the chance of apples appearing on the land — possibly at (6, 1) or nearby — which benefits the group.
- There is no immediate apple nearby (the nearest is at distance 4), so there is no benefit in eating one now.
- Cleaning the dirt at (6, 0) is the most
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Moving from (5, 8) towards (1, 8).
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (5, 8). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully.

Currently, I'm at (5, 8). The nearest apple is at (1, 8), which is 4 units away — a manageable distance. Eating that apple would give me +1.0 point immediately. However, the global scan shows that the nearest dirt is at (6, 0), 9 units away. Dirt cleaning is not immediately rewarding, but it's essential for future apple spawning — meaning, if I clean dirt, apples will become available in the future, which benefits the group.

But here's the key: apples only spawn *when the river is clean*. That implies the dirt is likely on the river path or near it. The dirt at (6, 0) is far from where I am, and there's no indication that the river path is currently dirty or that apples are spawning now. Since apples are not currently spawning (as per the observation — "you see nothing of interest"), it's likely the river is still dirty, and no apples are available.

Therefore, the immediate reward of eating an apple at (1,8) is possible — but only if it's already available. The observation says "you see nothing of interest nearby," which suggests that (1,8

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 1). You see dirt at (6, 0) and agent 2 at (6, 0).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 0).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 1), which is 4 units away. That means it's not immediately accessible. Even if I could reach it, there's no guarantee it will spawn unless the river is clean. The global scan shows that dirt at (6, 0) is the nearest dirt, and it's only 1 unit away — very close.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean. This means that cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apple generation. If I don't clean this dirt, no apples will spawn in the future — not just for me, but for the entire group.
- Agent 2 is currently at (6, 0), which is the dirt location. This suggests that agent 2 may also be trying to clean or is already engaged. But since the dirt is still present, and no indication that it has been cleaned, it remains a barrier.
- Eating an apple now is not viable — the nearest apple is far away and not currently accessible. There's no apple in immediate range.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning. Since apples are the only source of points, and they
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 0). You see dirt at (6, 0) and agent 1 at (6, 1).
  Thinking: I am at (6, 0), which is currently covered in dirt, and I see Agent 1 at (6, 1). The nearest apple is at (1, 0), which is 5 steps away. The dirt at (6, 0) is the nearest dirt patch, meaning it's currently blocking apple spawning in that area.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple immediately** – There is no apple at (6, 0). The nearest apple is at (1, 0), 5 steps away. Eating an apple would require movement and would not be possible unless I can reach it. Since I’m currently on dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), I cannot eat an apple now. So, this option is not feasible.

2. **Clean the dirt at (6, 0)** – This is the only dirt visible, and it's at my current position. Cleaning it would remove the dirt and allow apple spawning in that region. Since apples spawn only when the river is clean (less dirt), cleaning this dirt enables future apple spawning. This action has no immediate reward, but it is essential for long-term apple availability. Given that the nearest

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (4, 8). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: Given the current situation, let's analyze the trade-offs carefully:

You are at (4, 8). The nearest apple is at (1, 8), which is only 3 units away — a short and direct path. Eating that apple would give you an immediate +1.0 reward. That seems tempting.

However, the nearest dirt is at (6, 0), which is 10 units away. Dirt cleaning is not rewarding in itself, but it's essential for enabling apples to spawn in the future. Without cleaning dirt, apples won’t appear — so cleaning is a prerequisite for long-term gains.

But here's the key point: **apples only spawn when the river is clean**. That means the dirt at (6, 0) is not just a distant obstacle — it’s a systemic blocker. If we don’t clean it, apples won’t spawn at all, regardless of how many we could eat now.

Right now, there's a visible apple at (1, 8), which is within reach. But if we don’t clean the dirt, future apple spawning will be impossible — meaning the group’s long-term potential is locked.

So, should we eat the apple now?

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 1). You see agent 2 at (6, 0).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

You are at (6, 1). Agent 2 is at (6, 0), directly below you — this suggests proximity and potential coordination or competition. However, the key point is in the **global scan**:

- **Nearest Apple**: at (2, 1), distance = 4.  
  This means you must move leftward to reach it — a 4-step path. That's a reasonable distance, but not impossible.

- **Nearest Dirt**: *None found*.  
  This is critical. According to the rules, **apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (less dirt = more apples)**. If there is *no dirt* currently, then there's no dirt to clean — meaning **no cleaning action is possible**. Therefore, the "clean dirt" option (which would enable future apples) is not actionable at this moment.

So, the trade-off options become:

1. **Eat an apple** → Immediate +1.0 reward.  
   But there's no apple in immediate vicinity. The nearest is 4 steps away. You can't eat it without moving.  
   → **No immediate apple available** to eat. This option is not viable
  Decision: {'action': 'random_explore', 'args': {}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 0). You see agent 1 at (6, 1).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

You are at (6, 0), and Agent 1 is at (6, 1). The global scan shows:

- **Nearest Apple**: at (1, 0), distance = 5.  
- **Nearest Dirt**: None found.

This is critical. There is **no dirt** in the current scan — meaning there's nothing to clean. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt has been removed), and **no dirt exists**, there is **no opportunity to clean** right now. Therefore, **option 2 (cleaning dirt)** is not feasible at this moment.

Now, option 1: **Should you eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
The nearest apple is at (1, 0), which is 5 units away. You are at (6, 0), so you can move left along the x-axis to reach it. Movement is only allowed in cardinal directions (up, down, left, right), no diagonals.


--- Step 14 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — quite far. Eating it would give +1.0 point, but it's not immediately accessible or likely to spawn without first cleaning dirt.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 unit away — extremely close. Cleaning it is a low-effort, high-impact action that directly enables future apple spawning.
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Since the dirt is adjacent and currently blocking apple generation, removing it is a necessary step to create opportunities for apples to appear in the future — especially since the nearest apple is still far away.
- There is no immediate reward from cleaning dirt, but the long-term benefit is critical: without cleaning, apples will not spawn at all, and the group's ability to gain points is severely limited.
- Agent 2 is at (7, 2), which is directly above me at (7, 3), but there's no indication they are in danger or blocking access. There's no conflict or threat — just proximity.
- Moving to clean dirt at (7, 4) is a simple,
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the trade-off between immediate reward and long-term benefits.

Currently, I am at (7, 2), and the nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 steps away. That's a reasonable distance — not immediate, but reachable. However, the nearest dirt is at (7, 4), only 2 steps away. Cleaning dirt is essential because apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed). So, if I clean the dirt at (7, 4), I enable future apple spawning — which benefits the group and increases the total possible reward.

But here's the key point: **I cannot eat an apple unless it's already spawned**, and spawning depends on cleaning dirt. Since there's no indication that apples are currently spawning, and the nearest apple is at (12, 2) — which is far from any dirt — it's likely that the apple hasn't appeared yet.

Therefore, eating an apple now would be impossible, because there's no apple currently visible or accessible. The apple at (12, 2) may not be present yet — it only appears when the river is clean.

So, the immediate reward option is not viable. I

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here’s the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away. That means it’s not immediately accessible, and even if I were to move toward it, I’d have to traverse several steps — and the apple only spawns when the river is clean. Since the current state shows dirt at (7, 4), the river is not clean, and thus no apples are spawning — even if I were to reach the apple location.

- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 unit away from my current position (7, 5). This is a very short and low-effort action to clean. Cleaning it will improve the river's cleanliness, which in turn increases the chance of apples spawning in the future — especially in areas like (2, 5), which is currently unreachable due to the dirt blocking the river.

- Eating an apple now would give a +1.0 reward, but there are no apples visible or accessible right now. The global scan confirms that apples only spawn when the river is clean. Since the river is currently dirty, no apples are available for consumption — so attempting to eat one would be futile.

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Reasoning:

- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Right now, there is dirt at (7, 4), which is directly adjacent to my current position (7, 3). This dirt is blocking the potential for apples to spawn in that area — even if apples are far away (like at (12, 2)), they require a clean river to appear.
- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away. To reach it, I’d need to go through potentially dirty areas, and without cleaning dirt, apples won’t spawn at all — meaning I may never get access to apples at all.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0, but there are no apples visible nearby (the nearest is far away). There’s no apple at (7, 4) or adjacent to me — only dirt. So immediate apple consumption is not possible.
- Cleaning the dirt at (7, 4) is a necessary step to enable future apple spawning. This action doesn't give immediate points, but it enables the possibility of apples appearing in the future, which benefits both me and the group.
- Since I cannot

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the trade-off carefully based on the current situation.

I am at (7, 2), and I see Agent 1 at (7, 3) — directly above me. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away. That’s a significant distance. The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), which is only 2 units away — directly above me. Cleaning dirt is required to enable apple spawning, and apples only appear when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt). 

Right now, there is no apple in immediate reach, and the apple at (12, 2) is far away. If I eat an apple now, I get +1.0, but there’s no apple at my current location — so I can’t eat one. Therefore, option 1 (eating an apple) is not feasible.

Option 2: Cleaning dirt at (7, 4) is a viable and necessary action. Since dirt removal enables future apple spawning, and apples are the only source of points, cleaning dirt is essential for long-term success. Even though it gives no immediate reward, it sets the stage for future apple generation. The dirt is only 2 units

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away — quite distant and not immediately accessible.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), just one step away. Cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apples to spawn on land. Without cleaning dirt, apples won’t appear, regardless of how far they are.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 point, but only if one is available. There’s no indication of an apple currently visible or reachable at (7, 5) — the only apple mentioned is at (2, 5), far away.
- Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), cleaning dirt at (7, 4) is a necessary step to enable future apple spawning. This supports the group’s long-term goal of maximizing points.
- There’s no immediate reward in cleaning dirt — but the trade-off is clear: without cleaning, no apples will spawn in the future. This is a foundational action for sustainability.
- Moving to (7, 4) to clean it is a minimal cost (one step), and it directly advances the game state toward apple availability

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Reasoning:

- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Currently, there is dirt at (7, 4), which is adjacent to my current position (7, 3). This dirt is blocking apple spawning in that area.
- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — quite far. Eating it immediately would give only +1.0 point, but it would not solve the underlying issue: the river remains dirty, preventing future apple spawns.
- Cleaning dirt is not immediately rewarding, but it is essential for enabling apple spawning. Since apples spawn only when the river is clean, removing dirt at (7, 4) will allow apples to appear on land nearby, potentially increasing future opportunities for both me and agent 2.
- Agent 2 is at (7, 2), directly above me. If we both clean nearby dirt, we can create a clean zone that benefits the entire group. This cooperative action maximizes long-term points.
Cleaning dirt

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 1). You see dirt at (6, 0) and agent 1 at (6, 2).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 0).

Here's why:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 1), which is 4 units away — far from my current position at (6, 1). Eating it would require a long path and would not provide immediate benefit given the distance and the fact that apples only spawn *when the river is clean*.
- The dirt at (6, 0) is just one step away — a very short, low-effort action.
- Cleaning dirt is not rewarding directly, but it enables future apple spawning. Since apples only appear when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), cleaning this dirt will increase the chance of apples appearing in the area, potentially leading to more opportunities for both me and agent 1.
- Agent 1 is at (6, 2), directly above the dirt. If agent 1 is also trying to maximize points, they may be in a similar position. If we both clean nearby dirt, we improve the overall environment for apple spawning. This is a cooperative action that benefits the group.
- There's no immediate reward for eating an apple here — the apple is far away and not currently spawning due to dirt. Therefore, immediate consumption is not

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 7). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the trade-off between immediate reward and long-term benefit.

Currently, I am at (6, 7). The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 units away — a significant distance. There's no visible apple in immediate range, and I see nothing of interest nearby. The nearest dirt is at (6, 0), 7 units away — also far.

Key points:
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately, but only if an apple is present and accessible.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned.
- Cleaning dirt provides no immediate reward, but enables future apple spawning, which benefits the group.
- I cannot move diagonally, so movement is constrained to cardinal directions.

Given that:
- There are no apples in immediate range (within 1 or 2 steps), I cannot eat one right now.
- The nearest dirt is at (6, 0), which is 7 units away — I would need to travel down to (6, 0) to clean it.
- Once cleaned, that dirt will allow apples to spawn — potentially at (2, 5) or elsewhere, depending on the spawn rules.

  Obs: You are at (6, 1). You see dirt at (6, 0) and agent 2 at (6, 0).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 0).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 1), which is 4 units away. To reach it, I would need to move through several steps, and there is currently no indication that apples are spawning because the river is dirty.
- The dirt at (6, 0) is directly adjacent to me at (6, 1), and cleaning it would make the river cleaner, which is a prerequisite for apples to spawn. Without cleaning dirt, apples will not appear — even if they are nearby.
- The global scan shows that the nearest dirt is only 1 step away, meaning this is a low-effort, high-impact action.
- Eating an apple now is not feasible because the only apple visible is far away and not currently spawning due to the dirty river. There's no apple in my immediate vicinity.
- Agent 2 is currently at (6, 0), which suggests they may be trying to clean or interact with the dirt. However, since they are not moving, and there's no indication they are cleaning, it's likely that the dirt remains uncleaned and thus no apples are spawning.
- By cleaning the dirt, I enable the possibility of

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 0). You see dirt at (6, 0) and agent 1 at (6, 1).

There is no apple currently visible or accessible nearby, and the only dirt visible is at my current position (6, 0), which is at distance 0.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   — There is no apple at (6, 0). The nearest apple is at (1, 0), 5 units away. Since I’m currently on dirt, apples do not spawn here. Even if I move toward (1, 0), I must first clean the dirt along the way. Eating an apple is not possible right now, so this option is invalid.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   — Yes. Dirt at (6, 0) must be cleaned to allow apples to spawn in that area or nearby. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when there is less dirt), cleaning this dirt directly contributes to future apple availability. This is a necessary step for long-term

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 6). You see nothing of interest nearby.

Current position: (6, 6)  
Nearest Apple: (2, 5), distance = 5  
Nearest Dirt: (6, 0), distance = 6  

Key facts:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned).
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward but enables future apple spawning.
- Movement is only allowed in cardinal directions (up, down, left, right), no diagonals.

Now, evaluating the options:

1. **Eat an apple at (2, 5)**  
   - Distance is 5 — reachable in 5 steps.  
   - Immediate +1.0 point.  
   - However, if I eat this apple now, I’m using a resource (apple) that might not be sustainable long-term.  
   - But the apple is currently available — it only spawns when the river is clean. Since the river is currently dirty (dirt at (6,0)), apples *shouldn’t* be spawning.  
   → Wait — contradiction in the observation.

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 1). You see agent 2 at (6, 0).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

Current position: (6, 1)  
Agent 2 is at (6, 0) — directly below you, so they are in close proximity.  
Global scan shows:  
- Nearest apple is at (2, 1), distance = 4 units.  
- Nearest dirt: **None found**.

This is critical: **There is no dirt to clean**. That means cleaning dirt is not an option right now. Therefore, **option 2 (cleaning dirt to enable future apples)** cannot be pursued — there's nothing to clean.

Now, option 1: **Eat an apple for immediate reward**.  
The nearest apple is at (2, 1), which is 4 units away. To reach it, you'd need to move leftward (from column 6 to column 2), possibly going through rows 1 or 0, depending on path. Since movement is restricted to cardinal directions (no diagonals), the path would be:

(6,1) → (5,1) → (4,1) → (3,1) → (2,1)

That’s 4 moves. Assuming you can move one step per turn, and each

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 0). You see agent 1 at (6, 1).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

You are at (6, 0), and Agent 1 is at (6, 1). This suggests you're on the same vertical line, possibly in a narrow corridor or grid path. The nearest apple is at (1, 0), which is 5 units away — a significant distance. That means you can't reach it directly without moving left across the grid. 

Now, the global scan says: **"Nearest Dirt: None found."** This is critical. Dirt must be cleaned to enable apples to spawn. Since there is no dirt in the current scan, cleaning dirt is not currently possible — and therefore, **no apple spawning can occur** regardless of actions. This means the entire premise of "cleaning dirt to enable future apples" is currently inactive.

So, what does that mean for the trade-offs?

1. **Should you eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
Action: Eat the apple at
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 2, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'eat'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 8). You see agent 1 at (7, 7).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

Current position: (7, 8)  
Agent 1 is at (7, 7) — directly south, adjacent.  
Nearest apple is at (1, 8), which is 6 units away — far, but on the same horizontal line.  
Nearest dirt: **None found** in the global scan.

This is critical: **There is no dirt to clean.** Cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apples to spawn — apples only appear when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt has been removed). Since no dirt is visible or detectable, **there is currently no action that will enable future apple spawning**.

Therefore:

- **Option 1: Eat an apple?**  
  → There is no apple visible or accessible at (7,8) or nearby. The nearest apple is at (1,8), 6 steps away. We don’t know if it’s currently spawnable — and since no dirt exists, we can't assume apples will spawn there. Eating an apple now would require moving to (1,8), which is far and risky without knowing if it's reachable or safe. Also, since no dirt exists, cleaning is not needed — so the apple spawn

Moving from (8, 7) towards (13, 7).
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 7). You see agent 3 at (7, 8).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

You are currently at (8, 7).  
You see Agent 3 at (7, 8).  
The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 5 units away — that's a manageable distance.  
The global scan says "Nearest Dirt: None found." This is critical.

Key points:
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean.  
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but enables future apple spawning.  
- You cannot move diagonally, so movement is constrained to cardinal directions (up, down, left, right).  
- Your goal is to maximize points — apples give +1.0 each, cleaning dirt gives 0 immediate reward.

Now, the trade-off:

1. **Should you eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is an apple at (13, 7), 5 steps away. You can reach it. Eating it gives +1.0 immediately. But if you do that, you're consuming a resource that might have been available for future use — especially if cleaning dirt could enable more apples. However, since no dirt is currently visible (and the scan says "none found"), there's no dirt to
  Decision: {'action': 'move_to', 'args': {'coord_x': 13, 'coord_y': 7}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 1). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: Given the current situation:

- You are at (2, 1).
- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 4 units away — a reasonable distance, but not immediate.
- The global scan shows **no dirt** nearby. This is critical because apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when there is no dirt). Since there is no dirt currently, apples are not spawning — even if you move toward the apple at (2, 5), it won’t appear unless dirt is cleaned.

However, **dirt is not visible in the global scan**, which suggests it might be located elsewhere — perhaps off the immediate path or in a region not yet scanned. But since no dirt is reported, and apples are not spawning, the system implies that **apples are not currently available**.

Now, evaluating the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There is **no apple visible** in the current vicinity. The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 4 steps away and likely not accessible yet. Eating it would require movement and potentially waiting for it to spawn — which it won’t, because the river isn’t clean. So, **no
  Decision: {'action': 'random_explore', 'args': {}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 8). You see agent 1 at (8, 7).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

You are at (7, 8). Agent 1 is at (8, 7) — diagonally adjacent, but since you cannot move diagonally, you can only move up, down, left, or right. That means the closest direct path to agent 1 is via (7,7) or (8,8), which are adjacent.

However, the key point is this:

**Global Scan says: "Nearest Apple: at (1, 8), distance 6."**  
That means the apple at (1,8) is 6 steps away — a significant distance.  
Also, **"Nearest Dirt: None found."** — this is critical.

Rule: Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean.  
So, **no dirt = no apples can spawn**.  
Even if apples exist now, they cannot spawn in the future unless dirt is cleaned.

But the global scan says "Nearest Apple" is at (1,8). That implies apples *are* present — but only if the river is clean. Since there's no dirt listed, perhaps the river is already clean, or the dirt is far away and not visible.

But here’s the contradiction

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (9, 7). You see agent 3 at (8, 8).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

You are at (9, 7).  
You see Agent 3 at (8, 8).  
The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 4 units away — that’s a reasonable distance.  
The global scan says "Nearest Dirt: None found." This is critical.

### Key Observations:
- **Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean**.  
  → So, if there's *no dirt* currently, apples *cannot* spawn.  
  → Even if you're close to an apple, it won’t be there unless the river is clean.  
  → Therefore, **apples are not currently spawning**.

- The global scan says "Nearest Dirt: None found" — this likely means **no dirt is visible or detectable in the current scan**.  
  → This implies the river is clean (or at least, no dirt is present).  
  → But **apples require dirt to be cleaned** to spawn.  
  → So, **cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning**.

- You cannot move diagonally — so movement is limited to cardinal directions (up, down, left, right).

###
  Decision: {'action': 'random_explore', 'args': {}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (3, 1). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

You are currently at (3, 1).  
The global scan shows:
- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away.
- There is **no dirt** in the global scan — meaning there is currently no dirt to clean.

This is a critical point: **apples only spawn on land when the river is clean**. So, if there's no dirt to clean, there are no opportunities to clean, and therefore **no apples will spawn** — even if you move around.

Since there's **no dirt nearby**, the condition for apple spawning is not met. Therefore, **apples cannot spawn** in the current state, regardless of movement.

Now, consider the two options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward**  
   → But there are **no apples visible** near you. The nearest is 5 units away, and you currently see nothing of interest.  
   → Moreover, without dirt being cleaned, apples don't spawn. So, **no apple is available to eat** — not even in the immediate vicinity.  
   → This option is **not feasible** at this moment.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning**
  Decision: {'action': 'random_explore', 'args': {}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Moving from (8, 8) towards (13, 8).
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 8). You see agent 1 at (9, 7).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

You are currently at (8, 8). Agent 1 is at (9, 7), which is adjacent — possibly a potential coordination point, but not immediately relevant unless there's a threat or shared goal.

Global scan shows:
- The **nearest apple is at (13, 8)**, which is **5 units away**. That’s a reasonable distance, and since apples give +1.0 per eat, it's a direct, immediate reward.
- There is **no dirt visible** in the global scan. This is critical: **apples only spawn when the river is clean**, and cleaning dirt is required to enable apple spawning. But currently, there is no dirt to clean — so no immediate cleaning action is possible.

Now, evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple immediately**  
   → The apple at (13, 8) is reachable. You can move right to (9,8), then down to (10,8), (11,8), (12,8), (13,8) — a path of 5 steps.  
   → Eating it gives **+1.0 point immediately**.  
   This is a strategic move. Dirt prevents apple spawning. By cleaning it, we enable apples to spawn in that area (or nearby), which

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully and make a strategic decision based on the available information.

Current position: (7, 2)  
Agent 1 is at (7, 3) — directly above me, so we're in close proximity.  
Nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — quite far.  
Nearest dirt is at (7, 4), which is only 2 units away — very close.  

Key insight: Apples only spawn when the river is clean. Dirt removal enables apple spawning. There is no immediate reward for cleaning dirt — it’s purely a prerequisite for future apple generation. However, since apples are essential for scoring, and they don’t appear without clean river conditions, cleaning dirt is a necessary investment.

Right now, I am at (7,2). The dirt is at (7,4), directly above me. I can move up to (7,3) — but that’s where Agent 1 is. I must consider whether to:

- Eat an apple: There is no apple in immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (12,2), which requires moving 5 steps (right 5 units). That’s a long distance. No apple

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away. To reach it, I’d need to move through multiple tiles, possibly passing through or near dirt. However, there are no apples currently spawning because the river is not clean — specifically, dirt exists at (7, 4), which is directly adjacent to my current position.
- Cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apple spawning. Without cleaning, no apples will appear, even if I move toward the nearest apple. So, attempting to eat an apple now would be futile — there are no apples to eat in this state.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 tile away — a minimal cost to clean. This action directly enables future apple spawning, which benefits the group and increases long-term rewards.
- Eating an apple now is not possible because no apples are visible or accessible due to the dirty river condition. Even if I move toward (2, 5), the path is blocked by the absence of clean conditions.
- Therefore, the immediate reward (eating an apple) is zero due to the lack of spawnable apples. The only viable path to future rewards is cleaning

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — quite far. Eating it now would give only +1.0 point, but it's not immediately actionable due to distance and the need for a clean river to spawn apples.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 unit away — very close. Cleaning it will contribute directly to making the river cleaner, which enables apples to spawn in the future.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean. Therefore, cleaning dirt is not just a "future" action — it's a prerequisite for apple spawning. Without cleaning, no apples can appear, regardless of how far they are.
- Since agent 2 is at (7, 2), and we are at (7, 3), we can move to (7, 4) and clean it in one step. This is a simple, low-cost action with high strategic value.
- There's no immediate apple nearby to eat that would provide a greater reward than the long-term benefit of enabling future apple spawning. Moreover, the group's success depends on apples spawning, so cleaning dirt is a cooperative,

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision.

Current position: (7, 2)  
Agent 1 is at (7, 3) — directly above me, so we're in the same column.  
Nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — that's a fair distance, but reachable.  
Nearest dirt is at (7, 4), which is only 2 units away — very close.  

Key point: Apples only spawn when the river is clean. Dirt cleaning has no immediate reward, but enables future apple spawning. Since apples are the only source of points (+1.0 each), and we’re in a cooperative cleanup game, the long-term benefit of enabling future apple spawns (including for other agents) is significant.

Now, evaluating the options:

1. **Eat an apple immediately?**  
   The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which requires moving right 5 steps. That’s a long distance and may not be worth it if we can instead clean dirt to enable future apples. Since there’s no apple nearby (within 1 step), and the apple at (12,2) is far, eating it now would be

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away — a significant distance. Eating it would give a +1.0 immediate reward, but it's not nearby and likely not the most efficient use of movement.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 unit away — very close. Cleaning it directly contributes to making the river cleaner, which increases the chance of apple spawning in the future.
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. So, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple generation — a long-term, strategic investment.
- Since there's no immediate apple nearby, and the dirt is adjacent, the most impactful action is to clean it.
- Even though cleaning provides no immediate reward, it enables future apple spawns, which benefits the group and aligns with the core goal of maximizing points over time.
- Moving to clean the dirt is also a minimal-cost action (only one step), and it sets the stage for future apple access.

Therefore, I should clean the dirt at (7, 4) to enable future apple spawning. This is the optimal trade-off: no immediate reward, but essential for long

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision.

Current position: (7, 3)  
Agent 2 is at (7, 2) — directly above me, so we’re in the same column.  
There is dirt at (7, 4) — directly to my right (east).  
The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away (south-east direction).  
The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), only 1 unit away — very close.

Let’s evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple** — immediate +1.0 reward.  
   But there is no apple visible in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 steps away. Eating it would require moving through potentially dirty terrain, and since apples only spawn when the river is clean, we must first ensure the river is clean to even have apples available. Right now, there's dirt at (7,4), which likely affects the river's cleanliness. Without cleaning dirt, apples may not spawn at all — so eating an apple now is not possible, because no apple is present and the river is not clean.

2. **Clean the

I am at (7, 2), and I see Agent 1 at (7, 3) — directly above me. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away. The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), which is only 2 units away — directly above me. 

Key facts:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed).
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward but enables future apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.
- I cannot move diagonally, so movement is limited to cardinal directions.

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to make the best decision for maximizing points and supporting the group.

Current position: (7, 3)  
Agent 2 is at (7, 2) — directly above me.  
There is dirt at (7, 4) — directly to my right.  
The nearest apple is at (12, 2), 6 steps away.  
The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), just 1 step away.

Key rules:
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed).
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but enables future apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.
- You cannot move diagonally.

Now, evaluating the options:

1. **Eat an apple immediately?**  
   The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 steps away. I’m at (7, 3). To reach it, I’d need to go east to (7, 4) or (8, 3), then south or north to get to (12, 2). But there’s dirt at (7, 4) — which blocks access to land

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision for maximizing points and supporting the group.

I am at (7, 2), and I see Agent 1 at (7, 3). That means we are in the same column, just one step apart — a close proximity. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 steps away — quite a distance. The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), which is only 2 steps away from me. That means I can reach it quickly.

Now, evaluating the trade-offs:

1. **Eat an apple?**  
   The apple at (12, 2) is far away — I'd need to move 5 steps to get there. That’s inefficient, especially since I can't move diagonally. Even if I eat it, I’d be spending a lot of time and energy to get there. Also, there's no indication that apples are spawning now — apples only spawn when the river is clean. Since the river is currently dirty (dirt at (7,4)), apples aren't spawning. So eating an apple now would be impossible or unproductive — there's no apple at my current position or nearby.

2. **

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away — far enough that immediate consumption would not be efficient or practical.
- There is dirt directly adjacent at (7, 4), just one step away. Cleaning it is a low-effort, high-impact action that contributes to the river being clean.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple generation. Without cleaning, no apples will appear, even if we're close to them.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0, but it would be a wasted opportunity if we don’t ensure future apple spawns through cleaning.
- Since we are at (7, 5), moving to (7, 4) to clean is a single, valid move (no diagonal movement), and it directly advances the group's long-term goal.

Thus, the trade-off favors cleaning dirt over eating an apple. Cleaning enables future apple spawning, which supports both individual and group rewards. The immediate reward is small, but the long-term payoff is essential.

I am at (7, 3).  
Agent 2 is at (7, 2), directly above me.  
There is dirt at (7, 4), directly to my right.  
The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — a significant distance.  
The nearest dirt is only 1 unit away — very close and directly accessible.

Now, evaluating the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple visible in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which requires moving right and then up/down. There is no indication of any apple spawning nearby. Eating an apple would require first reaching it — which is far away and not immediately feasible. Also, since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), and we currently have dirt at (7, 4), there’s no apple spawning happening now. So, **eating an apple is not possible right now** and would be a wasted action.

2. **Clean dirt to ensure future apples spawn?**  
   This is critical. Dirt must be cleaned to

  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the current situation and make a strategic decision based on the trade-offs.

Current position: (7, 2)  
Agent 1 is at (7, 3) — directly above me, so we're in close proximity.  
Nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — on the same row, so moving right would reach it.  
Nearest dirt is at (7, 4), which is just one step above me — distance 2.  

Let’s evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple immediately?**  
   - The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 steps away.  
   - There are no apples visible nearby (e.g., at (7, 2) or (7, 3)).  
   - Eating an apple would give +1.0 point, but only if one is available and accessible.  
   - Since there’s no apple at (7, 2) or (7, 3), and the next apple is far away, **there is no immediate apple to eat**.  
   → So this option is not viable.

2. **Clean the dirt at (7,
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Reasoning:

- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Currently, there is dirt at (7, 4), which is directly adjacent to my current position (7, 5). This dirt is blocking the potential for apple spawning in that area.
- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away — quite far. Eating it would give +1.0 immediate reward, but it's not urgent or guaranteed to be available long-term.
- Cleaning dirt has no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning. Since apples are the only source of points and they depend on a clean river, clearing dirt is a prerequisite for future apple availability.
- The dirt is only one step away — a simple, low-effort action. I can move to (7, 4), clean it, and then proceed to explore further toward (2, 5) when apples become viable.
- If I skip cleaning now, the river remains dirty, and apples won’t spawn — even if I reach (2, 5), it may not be a valid apple location. This could result in a wasted trip and no points.

Therefore, the trade-off favors

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here’s the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — quite far. Eating it now would give +1.0 point, but it's not immediately accessible and would require significant movement.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 unit away — very close. Cleaning it will improve the river's cleanliness and enable apples to spawn in the future. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, this action directly enables future apple generation.
- There is no immediate reward for cleaning dirt, but it is a prerequisite for apple spawning. Without cleaning, even if apples exist elsewhere, they won’t appear.
- The agent at (7, 2) is nearby, but there's no indication they are blocking movement or threatening any immediate action. There’s no evidence of conflict or competition for resources.
- Given that apples are currently not spawning (due to dirt), and the only way to enable them is to clean the dirt, this is a necessary step for long-term progress.
   → So, **you cannot eat an apple now** — the apple at (2,5) is not accessible or present because the river
  Decision: {'action': 'random_explore', 'args': {}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 8). You see agent 1 at (8, 7).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

You are at (7, 8). Agent 1 is at (8, 7) — a diagonal position, but since you cannot move diagonally, you must move either horizontally or vertically. That means you can reach agent 1 via (7,7) or (8,8), then move to (8,7).

However, the key observation is in the **global scan**:

- **Nearest Apple**: at (1, 8), distance = 6. That's quite far.
- **Nearest Dirt**: None found.

This is critical. **Apples only spawn when the river is clean**, and cleaning dirt is required to enable apple spawning. But currently, there is **no dirt** in the global scan — meaning the river is already clean. Therefore, **apples are already spawning**, or at least, the condition for spawning is already met.

So, the question becomes:

> Should you eat an apple now (for +1.0), or should you clean dirt (which gives no immediate reward but enables future apples)?

But — **there is no dirt to clean**. Cleaning dirt is not needed because there is no dirt. Therefore, **the second option (cleaning dirt

Moving from (9, 7) towards (13, 7).
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (9, 7). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

You are at (9, 7).  
The nearest apple is at (13, 7) — a distance of 4 steps away.  
The global scan shows **no dirt nearby** — meaning there is no dirt to clean.  

Now, consider the two key options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward**  
   - Apples give +1.0 each.  
   - The apple at (13, 7) is within reach (4 steps), and you can walk to it.  
   - However, apples only spawn *when the river is clean*. The current state says "no dirt found" — which suggests the river is already clean.  
   - Therefore, apples are already available, so eating one is *possible* and *safe*.  

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning**  
   - Cleaning dirt gives *no immediate reward*.  
   - But it's necessary to enable more apples to spawn in the future.  
   - However, **there is no dirt to clean** — the global scan explicitly says "None found."  
   - So this action is **not feasible** right now.  

3. **Where should you explore?**
  Decision: {'action': 'move_to', 'args': {'coord_x': 13, 'coord_y': 7}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 0). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: Given the current situation:

- You are at position (2, 0).  
- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away — a significant distance.  
- The global scan shows **no dirt** nearby. This is critical because apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt has been removed).  
- There is **no immediate dirt** to clean, so there is no immediate action that would contribute to enabling apple spawning.  
- Eating an apple would give +1.0 point immediately, but there are no apples visible in the immediate vicinity — only one at (2, 5), which is far away.  
- Since no dirt exists, cleaning is not possible or necessary right now — it cannot contribute to apple spawning unless dirt is first discovered.

### Trade-off Analysis:

1. **Eat an apple?**  
   - No apple is visible nearby. The apple at (2, 5) is 5 steps away — you'd need to move there first.  
   - Without a nearby apple, eating one now would be inefficient.  
   - There’s no apple in range to consume immediately. So, **no immediate reward is available**.

2. **Clean
  Decision: {'action': 'random_explore', 'args': {}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Moving from (6, 8) towards (1, 8).
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 8). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: Given the current observation and global scan, let's analyze the situation carefully:

- You are at (6, 8).
- The nearest apple is at (1, 8), which is 5 units away — a significant distance.
- There is **no dirt** in the global scan, meaning there is currently no dirt to clean.
- Apples only spawn **when the river is clean**, and cleaning dirt enables future apple spawning. However, **no dirt exists currently**, so there is no immediate action to take to clean.
- Eating an apple gives **+1.0 point immediately**, which is a direct reward.
- Cleaning dirt gives **no immediate reward**, but enables future apple spawning — a long-term benefit.

### Key Trade-off Analysis:

1. **Eat an apple?**  
   - Immediate +1.0 point.  
   - The apple at (1, 8) is reachable (though 5 units away), and since you can move only in cardinal directions (up, down, left, right), you would need to move left from (6,8) to (1,8) — which is feasible.  
   - However, if there is **no dirt**, then cleaning is not possible, so the future apple spawning

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (10, 7). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: The current observation shows that I am at (10, 7), and the nearest apple is at (13, 7) — just 3 steps away. That means I can reach an apple in a short move, and eating it would give me an immediate +1.0 point. 

However, the nearest dirt is at (7, 0), which is 10 steps away. This suggests that cleaning dirt is not immediately feasible, and since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when there's less dirt), cleaning dirt would be a long-term investment with no immediate reward. 

But here’s the key trade-off:  
- Eating the apple at (13, 7) gives me a clear, immediate reward.  
- Cleaning dirt would enable future apple spawning, but it requires significant movement (10 steps) and no immediate benefit.  
- Since there’s no indication that the river is currently clean (and dirt is far away), apples are not currently spawning — so even if I clean dirt, it may take time to see results.  

Moreover, I see nothing of interest nearby — which suggests that there’s no urgent need to explore uncharted areas. The apple at (13, 7)
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 13, 'coord_y': 7}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 0). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to analyze the trade-off carefully.

Right now, I'm at (2, 0). The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away — directly upward along the same column. That means I can reach it in a straight line without any diagonal movement (which is not allowed). Eating an apple would give me +1.0 immediately.

However, the nearest dirt is at (7, 0), which is 5 units to the right. Cleaning dirt is essential because apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning that dirt must be removed to enable apple spawning. But cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward — it's a prerequisite for future apple generation.

The key question is: **Is there a benefit to cleaning dirt now, or should I prioritize immediate apple consumption?**

Let’s assess:

- If I eat the apple at (2,5), I get +1.0 immediately. That's a clear, tangible reward.
- But if I clean the dirt at (7,0), I’m enabling future apple spawns — which could benefit the group. However, there’s no guarantee that apples will spawn, and the river’s cleanliness depends on overall dirt levels, not just one spot.
- There is no apple
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 2, 'coord_y': 5}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (5, 8). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: Given the current situation, let's analyze the trade-offs carefully.

You are at (5, 8). The nearest apple is at (1, 8), which is exactly 4 units away — a straightforward path along the x-axis. Eating this apple would give you an immediate +1.0 reward. That seems appealing on the surface.

However, the global scan reveals that the nearest dirt is at (7, 0), which is 10 units away — quite distant. Dirt cleaning is necessary to enable apples to spawn, meaning that apples only appear when the river (or environment) is clean. But currently, there are no apples visible, and the dirt is far away. Cleaning dirt doesn’t give immediate reward — it's a long-term investment.

Now, consider the key point: **apples only spawn when the river is clean**. If we don’t clean the dirt, apples won’t spawn at all. But right now, there are no apples present — so even if we clean dirt, it will take time and effort to see results.

1. **Eat an apple
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 2, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 0). You see agent 1 at (6, 1).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

You are at (6, 0), and Agent 1 is at (6, 1). The global scan shows that the **nearest apple is at (1, 0)**, which is 5 units away — a considerable distance. There is **no dirt** listed in the global scan, meaning there is currently no dirt to clean. 

The rules state:
- Apples **only spawn on land when the river is clean** (i.e., less dirt = more apples).
- Cleaning dirt gives **no immediate reward**, but is **necessary** to enable future apple spawning.
- You **cannot move diagonally**, so movement is restricted to cardinal directions.

Now, consider the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward**  
   → There is no apple in immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (1, 0), which is 5 steps away.  
   → There is no apple visible or nearby to eat.  
   → Eating an apple is not feasible without movement and reaching it.  
   → **No immediate apple is available** — so this option is not viable right now.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning**  
   → The global scan says "No
  Decision: {'action': 'random_explore', 'args': {}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Moving from (6, 5) towards (2, 5).
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 5). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

You are currently at (6, 5).  
The global scan shows:
- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 4 units away (horizontally, since both are at y=5).  
- There is **no dirt** listed in the global scan — meaning no dirt is currently visible or detectable in the environment.

This is critical: **Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean**. Since there's no dirt to clean, there is no dirt to clean *now*, so the condition for apple spawning is already satisfied — or at least, not currently blocked.

But here’s the key: **The absence of dirt does not mean the river is clean**. It might mean dirt is far away or hidden, or that the system is in a state where apples can spawn even without visible dirt (but that contradicts the rule). Given the rule explicitly states that apples spawn *only when the river is clean (less dirt)*, and dirt must be cleaned to enable that, we must interpret that **dirt must exist** to be cleaned — and if there is no dirt reported, then either:
- The dirt is not in the current scan range, or
- The

--- Step 17 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (5, 1). You see agent 2 at (6, 1).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

You are at (5, 1). Agent 2 is at (6, 1), so you are adjacent to them. The nearest apple is at (2, 1), which is 3 units away — a reasonable distance, but not immediate. The global scan says **no dirt is found** — this is critical.

Now, consider the rules:
- Apples **only spawn on land when the river is clean** (i.e., less dirt = more apples).
- Cleaning dirt gives **no immediate reward** but is **necessary** for apples to spawn.
- You cannot move diagonally.
- Your goal is to **maximize points**, which come from eating apples (+1.0 each).

But here’s the key point: **There is no dirt to clean**. The global scan explicitly states "Nearest Dirt: None found." That means:
- There is currently no dirt in the environment.
- Therefore, **no cleaning action is possible or necessary**.
- Since apples are already spawning (as per the observation — an apple at (2,1) exists), the river is already clean.

So, the trade-off between:
1. Eating an apple now (immediate +1 point), or
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 2, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Moving from (6, 1) towards (2, 1).
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 1). You see agent 1 at (5, 1).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

You are at (6, 1), and Agent 1 is at (5, 1) — directly to your left. The nearest apple is at (2, 1), which is 4 units away in a straight line (since you can't move diagonally, it will take at least 4 steps to reach). That means you would need to move left along row 1 to get there.

However, the **global scan says there is no dirt nearby** — meaning there is no dirt to clean. Cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apples to spawn, but if there is no dirt in the environment, then cleaning is not possible. Therefore, **option 2 (cleaning dirt to enable future apples)** is not feasible right now.

Now, about **eating an apple**: the nearest apple is at (2, 1), which is 4 steps away. Eating it would give you +1.0 point immediately. But since you're at (6, 1), and the apple is at (2, 1), you would need to move left 4 steps to reach it. That requires a path that is currently unobstructed (assuming no obstacles are mentioned).

But here's the key
  Decision: {'action': 'move_to', 'args': {'coord_x': 2, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (5, 5). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: Given the current observation and global scan, let's analyze the situation carefully:

- You are at (5, 5).
- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 3 units away — directly to the left along the same row. This is a reachable apple with minimal movement cost.
- There is **no dirt** in the global scan, meaning there is currently no dirt to clean. This is a critical point: **apples only spawn when the river is clean**, and since there's no dirt reported, the condition for apple spawning is not currently met. Therefore, **no apples are currently spawning**, even if you were to clean dirt.

Now, evaluating the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward**:
   - The apple at (2, 5) is reachable and within range. Since there’s no dirt to clean, and apples only spawn when the river is clean, **this apple must be a pre-existing one** — it's already there, not dependent on cleaning.
   - Eating it gives +1.0 point immediately, which is a clear, tangible reward.
   - Since no dirt exists in the global scan, there’s no need to clean first — the apple is available now.

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (4, 1). You see an apple at (2, 1) and agent 2 at (5, 1).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (2, 1).

Reasoning:

- The apple at (2, 1) is within reach — only 2 steps away — and provides an immediate +1.0 point reward. This is a direct, actionable gain with no risk.
- The dirt at (7, 3) is far away (distance 5), and cleaning it would only enable future apple spawning. Since apples are already present and accessible, there's no immediate benefit to cleaning dirt now.
- There is no indication that the river is currently dirty or that apple spawning is disabled — the global scan confirms an apple is already present, meaning the system is already in a state where apples can spawn.
- Agent 2 is at (5, 1), which is on the same row as me and the apple. They may be a threat or competitor, but there's no evidence of conflict or blocking. Moving toward the apple does not put me in danger.
- Since apples spawn only when the river is clean, and we already have an apple, cleaning dirt is not urgent. It's a long-term investment with no immediate payoff.

Therefore, the optimal strategy is to maximize immediate reward. Eating the apple at (2, 1) gives me a
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 2, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (5, 1). You see agent 1 at (4, 1).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the trade-off between immediate reward and long-term group benefit.

Currently, I'm at (5, 1), and the nearest apple is at (2, 1) — a distance of 3 steps. That means I can reach it in 3 moves: (5,1) → (4,1) → (3,1) → (2,1). However, agent 1 is already at (4,1), which is directly adjacent to my path. This suggests they may already be on the path to the apple or might be blocking access.

But here's the key: apples only spawn when the river is clean — i.e., when dirt is removed. The nearest dirt is at (7,3), which is 4 steps away. Cleaning it would enable future apple spawning, but it requires movement and effort without immediate reward. Since apples are already available at (2,1), and the river is currently not clean (dirt is present), the apples may not be spawning yet — so the current apple at (2,1) might be a temporary or conditional spawn.

However, **apples only spawn when the river is clean**. Since no dirt exists, and we have no dirt to clean, **apples cannot spawn**. So, even if you

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (3, 8). You see an apple at (1, 8).
  Thinking: I am at (3, 8) and see an apple at (1, 8), which is 2 steps away horizontally. The global scan shows no nearby dirt — meaning there is no dirt to clean currently. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when there is dirt to clean), and no dirt is present, there is currently no mechanism to generate new apples.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat the apple at (1, 8)**:  
   - This gives +1.0 point immediately.  
   - The apple is within reach — only 2 steps left (move to (2,8), then (1,8)).  
   - Since no dirt exists, there is no future apple spawning benefit from cleaning.  
   - Eating the apple is safe and provides immediate reward with no risk.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apples**:  
   - There is no dirt to clean.  
   - Without dirt, cleaning is not possible.  
   - Therefore, this action is not feasible at this moment.  
   - Even if dirt existed, cleaning gives no immediate reward and requires time and movement.  
   - Since apples don’t spawn without clean river conditions, and no

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 0). You see agent 2 at (6, 1).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

You are at (6, 0), and Agent 2 is at (6, 1) — directly above you. This suggests a potential coordination opportunity, but only if movement is restricted or if agents need to work together.

The key facts from the global scan:
- **Nearest Apple**: at (1, 0), which is 5 units away. That's a long distance.
- **Nearest Dirt**: *None found* in the global scan.

This is critical. Apples only spawn on land **when the river is clean** — meaning, dirt must be cleaned *before* apples can appear. Since no dirt is currently visible in the global scan, it suggests that either:
- There is no dirt to clean (so no need to act), or
- The dirt is not yet detected (and may be hidden or far away), or
- The system is in a state where apples are not currently spawning because the river is not clean.

But here's the key point: **Apples only spawn when the river is clean**. If there's no dirt to clean, then the river is already clean, and apples can spawn — *but only if they are already present*. The nearest apple is

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 1). You see agent 1 at (6, 0).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

You are at (6, 1). Agent 1 is at (6, 0), directly below you — a close proximity that may imply coordination or competition, but currently, no direct interaction is required.

Global scan reveals:
- The **nearest apple is at (2, 1)**, which is 4 units away (horizontal distance). This is a reasonable distance, but not immediate.
- **No dirt is found in the global scan** — this is critical. Dirt is the only thing that needs to be cleaned to enable apples to spawn. Since no dirt is visible, it suggests that either:
  - Dirt is far away (and thus not worth immediate effort), or
  - Dirt is hidden in unexplored areas (and cleaning it would unlock future apple spawning).

Now, consider the two key decisions:

### Option 1: Eat an apple for immediate reward
- The nearest apple is at (2,1), which is 4 units away — you’d need to move left to reach it.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.
- But: **Apples only spawn when the river is clean**. If there's no dirt to clean, apples aren't spawning — so
  Decision: {'action': 'random_explore', 'args': {}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 8). You see an apple at (1, 8).
  Thinking: The current situation is straightforward and offers a clear trade-off between immediate gain and long-term benefit.

1. **Immediate Reward**: There is an apple directly adjacent at (1, 8), just one step away. Eating it would give +1.0 point immediately — a guaranteed, low-effort reward with no risk.

2. **Future Apple Spawning via Dirt Cleaning**: The global scan shows "No dirt found" near the current location. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), and there is currently no dirt to clean, this action is not applicable. There is no immediate benefit to cleaning dirt in this state — no dirt means no need for cleaning, and thus no future apple spawning to enable.

3. **Exploration**: Since there is no dirt to clean and no other apples or hazards indicated in the global scan, there is no compelling reason to explore further. The nearest apple is already within reach.

### Conclusion:
The only viable and immediate action is to eat the apple at (1, 8). There is no dirt to clean, so no long-term benefit from that action. The apple provides a direct, positive reward with no cost. 

Therefore, **the best decision is to eat the

Agent 2 is at (6, 0) — very close, possibly a threat or a potential ally depending on context.  
Nearest apple: (1, 0), distance = 4 units — far away.  
Nearest dirt: (6, 3), distance = 4 units — also far away.  

Key point: Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Cleaning dirt has no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning. So, the trade-off is between immediate gain (eating an apple) and long-term benefit (cleaning dirt to enable future apples).

However, **there are no apples in immediate range** — the nearest apple is 4 units away. The nearest dirt is also 4 units away. That means:
- Eating an apple now is not possible without moving to (1, 0), which is far and requires traversing potentially dirty terrain.
- Cleaning dirt at (6,3) would require moving to (6,3), which is adjacent to agent 2 at (6,0) — a potentially risky move
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 3}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 0). You see agent 1 at (5, 0).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to decide the best course of action.

Current position: (6, 0)  
Agent 1 is at (5, 0) — directly adjacent, so we’re on the same row, very close.  
Nearest apple is at (1, 0), which is 5 units away — quite far.  
Nearest dirt is at (6, 3), which is only 3 units away — very close.  

Important rule: Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. So, cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning. However, cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward — only long-term benefit. Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately.

But here’s the key: **There is no apple currently visible in the immediate vicinity**. The nearest apple is at (1,0), which is 5 units away — that’s a long way to go. Even if I move toward it, I’d have to traverse open terrain, and there’s no indication of any intermediate apples or clean zones.

Meanwhile, the dirt at (6,3) is just 3 units away — very accessible. Cleaning it would help the river become cleaner, which would allow apples to spawn on land
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 3}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (1, 8). You see an apple at (1, 8).
  Thinking: I am at (1, 8), and there is an apple directly at my current position — distance 0. This means I can immediately eat it and gain +1.0 point. 

Let’s evaluate the options:

1. **Eat the apple now**:  
   - Immediate reward: +1.0 point.  
   - This gives me a direct, tangible benefit.  
   - The apple is already present and accessible — no cost or delay.  
   - Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and we currently have no dirt nearby (the nearest dirt is at (6,3), 10 units away), there’s no immediate need to clean dirt to spawn apples.  
   - Eating now doesn’t harm future apple spawning — it only consumes one apple. The spawning condition (clean river) is not currently violated.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning**:  
   - Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward.  
   - The nearest dirt is far away (distance 10), meaning it would take many steps to reach and clean.  
- There is no immediate apple in range that justifies eating it now. The trade-off is clear: immediate +1.0 vs. enabling future +1.0+ apples through clean
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully.

I am at (7, 2), and I see Agent 1 at (7, 3) — directly above me. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away. The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), which is only 2 units away — directly above me. 

Key facts:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed).
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but enables future apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.
- I cannot move diagonally — so movement is restricted to up, down, left, right.

Now, evaluating the options:

1. **Eat an apple immediately?**  
   The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 steps away. I'm at (7, 2), so I'd need to move right 5 steps to reach it. That's a long distance. There's no apple at (7, 2) or nearby. The apple is not accessible without moving. So, I cannot eat an apple right now — there's no apple in immediate range.

2. **Clean
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away — quite far. Eating it would give a +1.0 reward, but it would be a small, isolated gain with no immediate benefit to the group.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 unit away — extremely close. Cleaning it directly addresses a key requirement: apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. This means cleaning dirt enables future apple spawning, which benefits the entire group.
- There is no immediate reward for cleaning dirt, but the long-term payoff is significant — more apples will become available as the environment improves.
- Since I cannot move diagonally, moving to (7, 4) is straightforward (one step south), and cleaning it is a simple, low-cost action that directly contributes to the system's health.
- The global scan shows no other dirt or apples nearby, so there's no alternative immediate target.

Therefore, the trade-off favors cleaning the dirt. While eating an apple gives immediate points, it doesn’t contribute to the system's sustainability. Cleaning dirt enables future apple spawns, which supports both individual and group goals. This align

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the current situation and the trade-offs involved.

Currently, I am at (7, 3). Agent 2 is at (7, 2), directly above me. There is dirt at (7, 4), which is immediately to my right — just one step away. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 steps away in a straight line (down-right direction), meaning it's not immediately accessible.

Key facts:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be removed to enable apple spawning.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but enables future apple spawns (which benefits the group).
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediate reward.
- I cannot move diagonally — so movement is restricted to cardinal directions (up, down, left, right).

Now, evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple** — There is no apple visible at my current position (7,3). The nearest apple is at (12,2), which is far away. I would need to travel there first, and even then, there’s no guarantee it will be available immediately. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and the current dirt at (

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision for maximizing points and contributing to the group's success.

Current position: (7, 2)  
Agent 1 is at (7, 3) — directly above me, so we’re in the same column, adjacent. This suggests possible coordination or competition, but since we're both agents, and the goal is to eat apples (which spawn only when the river is clean), cooperation might be beneficial.

Key facts:
- Nearest apple is at (12, 2), 5 steps away — quite far.
- Nearest dirt is at (7, 4), only 2 steps away — very close and directly above me.

Important rule: Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed). So, cleaning dirt is essential for future apple spawning — not immediately rewarding, but foundational.

Now, the trade-off:
1. **Eat an apple?**  
   The nearest apple is 5 steps away. I can’t reach it immediately. Even if I move toward it, I’d have to go through (7,3), (7,4), (7,5), (8,5), etc. But (7,

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away. That means I would need to move through multiple tiles to reach it — and since I can’t move diagonally, that’s at least 5 steps (e.g., left, then up/down as needed). Even if I could reach it, there’s no guarantee that apple will spawn or remain available — apples only spawn when the river is clean, which depends on dirt being cleaned.
  
- The dirt at (7, 4) is just one step away (distance 1). Cleaning it would improve the overall river cleanliness, which increases the chance of apples spawning in the future — including at (2, 5) and potentially other locations. This supports the group's long-term goals.

- Eating an apple now gives a +1.0 reward, but it’s only available if the river is clean. Since the river currently has dirt, apples likely won’t spawn — so the apple at (2, 5) may not even be accessible or sustainable. Therefore, eating an apple now would be a wasted action.

- Cleaning dirt has no immediate reward, but it is a necessary

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision.

Currently, I am at (7, 3). Agent 2 is at (7, 2), directly above me. There is dirt at (7, 4), which is directly to my right — just one step away. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 steps away in a straight line (right and down). 

Let’s evaluate each option:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward**  
   - Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned).  
   - Right now, there is dirt at (7, 4), so no apples are currently spawning.  
   - Therefore, **there is no apple available to eat** at this moment.  
   - Even if I were to move to (12, 2), I would still need the river to be clean for apples to spawn — which it isn't now.  
   → So, **eating an apple is not possible** and thus not a valid option.

2. **Clean the dirt at (7, 4)**  
   - This is a necessary step to enable future apple spawning.  
   - The dirt

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision.

Currently, I am at (7, 2), and I see Agent 1 at (7, 3) — directly above me. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 steps away. That’s a reasonable distance, but not immediate. The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), which is just one step above me — a very close and accessible target.

Now, consider the trade-offs:

1. **Eating an apple for immediate reward**:  
   The apple at (12, 2) is 5 steps away. I would need to move right to (8,2), then (9,2), (10,2), (11,2), (12,2) — a long path. There’s no apple nearby (within 1 step), so eating one would require significant travel and time. Moreover, since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), and we currently have dirt at (7,4), there’s no immediate apple spawning benefit unless we clean it.

2. **Cleaning dirt to enable future apple spawning**:  
   → There is no apple currently available for you to eat. The nearest apple is at (1, 0), which is 5 units away. You would need to move to that location to reach it. But since there is no dirt to clean, and no apples are spawning, the apple at (1,
  Decision: {'action': 'random_explore', 'args': {}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 5). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: Given the current observation and global scan, let's analyze the situation carefully.

You are at (6, 5).  
The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 4 units away — a reasonable distance, but not immediate.  
Crucially, the global scan states: **"Nearest Dirt: None found."** This is a key point.  

Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning, dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning. Since there is **no dirt currently visible**, there is no dirt to clean, so **no immediate cleaning action is needed**.  

Now, evaluating the three options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   The apple at (2, 5) is 4 units away — you can reach it via movement (only horizontal/vertical, no diagonals). But you currently see nothing of interest nearby, and there's no indication that apples are spawning or that the apple is accessible without clearing dirt. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and there's no dirt, the apple may not even be *available* or *stable*. In other words, the apple at (2,5) might not be real or might be temporary

Moving from (5, 1) towards (2, 1).
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (5, 1). You see agent 2 at (6, 1).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

You are at (5, 1), and Agent 2 is at (6, 1) — directly to your right. The nearest apple is at (2, 1), which is 3 units away (along the x-axis). That means you can reach it by moving left, which is straightforward and within your movement constraints (no diagonal movement).

However, the global scan says: **"Nearest Dirt: None found."** This is critical.

- Apples only spawn **when the river is clean**, and cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning.
- Right now, there is **no dirt** in the scan — meaning the river is already clean.
- Therefore, **apples are already spawning**, and there is no need to clean dirt to enable future apple spawns.

So, the trade-off between:
1. Eating an apple for immediate reward (1 point),
2. Cleaning dirt for future apple spawning (no immediate reward, but enables apples),

— **does not apply**, because apples are already spawning due to the river being clean.

Moreover, since the nearest apple is at (2, 1), and you can reach it in 3 steps (left-left-left), and there's no danger or
  Decision: {'action': 'move_to', 'args': {'coord_x': 2, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 1). You see agent 1 at (5, 1).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

You are at (6, 1), and you see Agent 1 at (5, 1). This means you are directly adjacent horizontally — a shared edge — so communication or coordination might be possible, though no explicit interaction is mentioned.

**Global Scan:**
- Nearest Apple: (2, 1), distance = 4 units (4 steps to reach).
- Nearest Dirt: *None found*.

This is critical. **There is no dirt currently in the environment.** That means:
- Apples do not spawn when the river is dirty — they only spawn when the river is clean.
- Since there's *no dirt*, the river is already clean — so apples *can* spawn *now*, even without cleaning.
- Therefore, **cleaning dirt is not necessary** — it's not needed to enable apple spawning because the system is already clean.

So, the trade-off question becomes:

> Should you eat an apple now (immediate +1.0 reward), or should you clean dirt (which gives no immediate reward but enables future apples)?

But: **There is no dirt to clean.** Cleaning dirt is a futile action here — there's nothing to clean.

Therefore, **option

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (5, 5). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: The current observation shows that you are at (5, 5), and there is an apple at (2, 5) — a distance of 3 units away. However, the global scan indicates that **no dirt is found nearby**, which is critical because:

- Apples **only spawn on land when the river is clean** (i.e., when there is less dirt).
- **Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward**, but it is **necessary** to enable future apple spawning.
- There is **no dirt to clean**, so no cleaning action is possible right now.

Given this:
- **Eating the apple at (2, 5)** is feasible and provides an immediate +1.0 reward.
- There is **no dirt to clean**, so the "future apples" benefit from cleaning is not actionable — the condition for apple spawning is already not met due to lack of dirt, or rather, the dirt is absent, which may mean the river is already clean.

But here’s the key insight: **If there is no dirt, the river is clean**. That means apples *can* spawn — they are already enabled. Therefore, the condition for apple spawning is satisfied, and the apple at (2, 5) is accessible.

Thus

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (4, 1). You see an apple at (2, 1) and agent 2 at (5, 1).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (2, 1).

Reasoning:

- The apple at (2, 1) is within reach — only 2 steps away (moving left to (3,1), then (2,1)). This is a direct, immediate reward of +1.0 point, which is valuable and achievable without risk.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 3), which is 5 steps away. Cleaning it would require a significant effort and provides no immediate benefit. Moreover, apples only spawn when the river is clean, which means the dirt must be cleaned *before* apples appear. Since apples are already visible at (2,1), the river is currently clean enough to support spawning — meaning we don’t need to clean dirt *now* to enable apple growth.
- Agent 2 is at (5,1), which is on the same row as the apple and the dirt. They may be planning to act on the dirt or the apple. However, there is no indication that agent 2 is currently taking action — so the risk of conflict or interference is low.
- There is no nearby dirt to clean, and the apple is already present. Therefore, cleaning dirt is not a necessary or urgent action.
- Since

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (5, 1). You see agent 1 at (4, 1).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision for maximizing points and contributing to the group's success.

Currently, I am at (5, 1), and I see Agent 1 at (4, 1). The nearest apple is at (2, 1), which is 3 steps away — a reachable distance. Eating an apple would give me +1.0 immediately, which is a clear short-term reward.

However, the nearest dirt is at (7, 3), which is 4 steps away. Cleaning dirt is essential because only when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is removed) do apples spawn. So, cleaning dirt enables future apple spawning — a long-term benefit for the group. But cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, and it requires movement.

Right now, there are no apples nearby that are spawnable because the river is not clean. So, even though the apple at (2, 1) is within reach, it will not spawn unless the dirt is cleaned. Wait — this is critical.

The observation says: "Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (less dirt = more apples)." That means apples don’t exist unless the river is clean. So, if the dirt at (

Moving from (8, 7) towards (9, 7).
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 7). You see agent 3 at (9, 8).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to determine the best course of action.

Current position: (8, 7)  
Agent 3 is at (9, 8) — relatively close, but not directly in my path.  
Nearest apple is at (13, 7), 5 steps away.  
Nearest dirt is at (7, 0), 8 steps away.  

Key rules:  
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.  
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned).  
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward but enables future apple spawning.  
- Movement is only allowed in cardinal directions (up, down, left, right).  
- No diagonal movement.  

Now, the trade-off:

1. **Eat an apple immediately?**  
   The apple at (13, 7) is within reach (5 steps). That’s a clear path: move right to (9,7), then to (10,7), (11,7), (12,7), (13,7). This is feasible and gives immediate +1.0 reward.

Agent 2 (High-Level):

  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision for maximizing points and supporting the group.

Current position: (4, 1)  
Nearest Apple: (2, 5) — distance 6  
Nearest Dirt: (7, 0) — distance 4  

Key facts:
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned).
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but enables future apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.
- I cannot move diagonally — so movement is constrained to cardinal directions (up, down, left, right).

Let’s assess the options:

1. **Eat an apple at (2, 5)?**  
   - Distance is 6 — that’s quite far.  
   - To reach it, I’d have to travel through potentially dirty terrain.  
   - There’s no indication that any apple is nearby or accessible.  
   - Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and there's no clean river currently, it's likely that the apple at (2,5) is not spawning yet — it may be inactive or not even present.  
   - Therefore, eating it might not be possible or

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (9, 8). You see agent 1 at (8, 7).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision as Agent 3.

Current position: (9, 8)  
Agent 1 is at (8, 7) — relatively close, but not directly in the way of immediate action.  
Nearest apple is at (13, 8), which is 4 steps away — reachable via a straight path (right to (10,8), (11,8), (12,8), (13,8)).  
Nearest dirt is at (7, 0), distance 10 — very far away.  

Key point: Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed). So, cleaning dirt enables future apple spawning — but it takes time and effort.  

Now, evaluating the trade-offs:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   - Yes, the nearest apple is within reach (4 steps).  
   - Eating it gives +1.0 point immediately.  
   - No other immediate benefit is available.  
   - Since apples are only available when the river is clean, and the river is currently dirty (as dirt is present), we must ask: is the river currently clean?

Moving from (9, 7) towards (13, 7).
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (9, 7). You see agent 3 at (10, 8).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the trade-off between immediate reward and long-term benefits.

Currently, I'm at (9, 7). The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 4 units away — a manageable distance. Eating an apple would give me +1.0 immediately, which is a clear, tangible reward.

However, the nearest dirt is at (7, 0), which is 9 units away. Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning, but it provides no immediate reward. The key point is that apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt cleanup is a prerequisite for future apple availability. Since apples are not currently spawning (as the river is not clean), cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future rewards, not a standalone action.

Given that:
- I'm currently at (9,7), which is close to the apple at (13,7),
- There's no immediate dirt nearby (the nearest is 9 units away),
- The apple is within reach and will spawn only if the river is clean (which it isn’t now),
- I cannot move diagonally, so movement is constrained to cardinal directions,

I must ask: can I reach the apple without first cleaning dirt? The answer is yes —

- There are no apples visible in immediate range. The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 7 units away — far beyond a practical reach in a single mission, especially since movement is restricted to cardinal directions and no diagonal movement is allowed.
- The dirt at (7, 0) is only 3 units away from my current position (5, 1). This is a very close and accessible target.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning that cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apple generation. Without cleaning, no apples will appear, regardless of how far they are.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0, but there are no apples currently available in the vicinity. The global scan confirms no apples are near, so immediate consumption is not viable.
- Cleaning dirt provides no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning. This is a long-term strategy that benefits the group — and since the goal is to maximize points *over time* through sustainable gameplay, this is the optimal choice.
- Even though the apple at (2, 5) is far away, cleaning the dirt at (7, 0) will

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (10, 8). You see agent 1 at (9, 7).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the trade-off between immediate reward and long-term benefit.

Currently, I'm at (10, 8). The nearest apple is at (13, 8), which is only 3 steps away — a short and accessible path. Eating that apple would give me +1.0 immediately, which is a clear, tangible reward with no risk.

However, the nearest dirt is at (7, 0), which is 11 steps away — far from my current position. Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning, but it requires significant effort and time. Since the apple at (13, 8) is within reach, and there's no indication that apples are currently spawning (because the river isn't clean), I must ask: is it worth investing time in cleaning dirt now, when I can get an apple immediately?

The key point is that apples only spawn when the river is clean. Right now, the river is not clean (since dirt exists at (7,0)), so no apples are spawning. Therefore, even if I clean dirt, I can't get apples until the river is clean. But if I don't clean dirt, apples won't spawn at all — so cleaning is essential for future apple spawns

   The apple at (12, 2) is 5 steps away — not immediately accessible. I would have to move to (7, 3), then (7, 4), then (7, 5), etc., to get to (12, 2). That’s a long path, and I don’t have any apple in immediate range. There’s no apple visible at (7, 2) or nearby. So, I

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away — quite far. Eating it would give a +1.0 reward, but it's not immediately accessible and would require a long path.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 unit away — directly below me at (7, 5). Cleaning it is a low-effort, high-impact action that directly contributes to improving the environment.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when there is less dirt). By cleaning this dirt, I’m enabling the possibility of apples spawning in the future — potentially in nearby areas, including closer to my current position or along the river.
- Since apples spawn based on cleanliness, cleaning dirt is not just a side task — it’s a prerequisite for future rewards. Without cleaning, even if apples exist, they won’t spawn.
- There is no immediate benefit to eating an apple now, given that it's far away and would require significant movement. Moreover, the group benefits from a cleaner environment — which supports long-term apple generation.
- There’s no indication of other dirt or apples nearby that would offer

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision for maximizing points and contributing to the group's success.

**Current Position**: (7, 3)  
**Agent 2's Position**: (7, 2) — directly above me  
**Dirt at**: (7, 4) — directly to my right  
**Nearest Apple**: (12, 2) — 6 units away (horizontal distance)  
**Nearest Dirt**: (7, 4) — only 1 unit away  

**Key Observations**:
- There is **no apple currently visible** in immediate proximity. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is far away and requires significant movement.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is **very close** — only one step away. Cleaning it would allow apples to spawn on land *in that area* or nearby, which could eventually lead to apple availability.
- Eating an apple now would give **+1.0**, but there are **no apples at (7, 3)** or nearby. There is no immediate apple spawn in my current position.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is the only actionable element within range. Cleaning it

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4) to ensure future apple spawning.

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — that's a significant distance, and we currently have no immediate access to it.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), just one step away from my current position (7, 2). That means I can reach it in a single move (up one square).
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apple generation. Without cleaning, no apples will appear, regardless of how far they are.
- Eating an apple now would give a +1.0 reward, but there are no apples currently visible or reachable. The global scan shows no apples in proximity — the nearest is 5 steps away, and without cleaning, no apples will spawn at all.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning — which benefits the group and increases long-term points. Since apples are the only source of points, this action directly supports the group's ability to earn points in the future.
- There is no immediate danger or obstacle, and the path to the dirt is straightforward (move

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: Given the current situation, I must analyze the trade-off carefully.

I am at (7, 5), and I see dirt at (7, 4) — just one step away. The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 steps away. That means I can't reach it without moving through potentially dirty terrain. Importantly, apples only spawn when the river is clean — that is, when dirt has been removed. Right now, there is dirt at (7, 4), and since apples require a clean river (i.e., no dirt), the presence of dirt suppresses apple spawning.

However, I do not currently see any apple nearby — the nearest is 5 steps away. That means even if I were to eat an apple, it would require a long journey, and I have no immediate access to one. Eating an apple now would give me +1.0 point, but only if there's an apple available. Since there is no apple visible at (7, 5) or nearby, and the only apple is far away at (2, 5), I cannot eat one immediately.

Cleaning the dirt at (7, 4) would not give me immediate points, but it would improve the environment —

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here's my reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — quite far. There's no immediate apple nearby at (7, 3), so eating one now would give only +1.0 point with no strategic benefit.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 unit away — extremely close. Cleaning it will improve the river's cleanliness, which directly enables apples to spawn in the future. This is a prerequisite for long-term apple availability.
- Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, cleaning dirt is not just a "future" action — it's a necessary condition for apple spawning. Without cleaning, no apples can appear in that area.
- There's no immediate benefit to eating an apple now (no nearby apple), and doing so would waste a valuable opportunity to improve the environment for future apple generation.
- Agent 2 is at (7, 2), which is directly above me — but there's no indication of conflict or cooperation needed. No evidence suggests a need to avoid or engage with them.
- Exploring further is not necessary — the dirt is adjacent and the goal is to maximize long-term points
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the trade-off between immediate rewards and long-term benefits.

Currently, I am at (7, 2), and the nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away. That means I would need to move right along the row to reach it. However, there's a dirt patch at (7, 4), just one step up from my current position — that’s only 2 units away. Cleaning that dirt would be a very efficient action, as it directly contributes to making the river clean and enabling apple spawning in the future.

Now, let's break down the options:

1. **Eat an apple immediately**: There are no apples nearby — the nearest is 5 steps away. I can’t eat one without moving. So, no immediate apple is available. Even if I go to (12, 2), I would have to walk 5 steps, and there’s no indication that an apple is already present at that location. The global scan says "nearest apple at (12, 2)", which implies it's not currently visible or accessible. So, eating an apple now is not feasible.

2. **Clean dirt at (7, 4)**: This is very close —

Agent 3 (High-Level):

--- Step 19 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (11, 7). You see an apple at (13, 6), an apple at (13, 7) and an apple at (13, 8).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 0) — even though it's far away and doesn't offer immediate reward.

Here's the reasoning:

- Apples only spawn when the river is clean. Right now, there are apples at (13,6), (13,7), and (13,8), which suggests the river is already relatively clean — but the global scan shows dirt at (7,0) with a distance of 11. That means the system is not fully clean, and apples may not spawn reliably in the long term unless dirt is removed.

- Eating an apple now (e.g., at (13,7)) gives +1.0 point immediately, which is tempting. However, since apples are already present, they may be temporary or conditional on ongoing cleanliness. If we don’t clean the dirt, future apple spawns may be blocked, and the group’s ability to earn points over time will be limited.

- The trade-off is between immediate reward and long-term sustainability. While eating now gives a short-term gain, cleaning dirt ensures that more apples can spawn in the future — potentially leading to higher total points over time.

- The dirt at (7,0) is the only known source of dirt,
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 1). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: Given the current situation, let's analyze the trade-offs carefully:

1. **Immediate apple reward?**  
   The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 4 units away. Since you are at (2, 1), you can move directly upward to reach it in 4 steps (no diagonal movement allowed). Eating an apple would give you +1.0 point immediately — a clear, tangible reward. However, this action does not contribute to long-term sustainability or future apple spawning.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apples?**  
   The nearest dirt is at (7, 0), which is 6 units away. Cleaning dirt has no immediate reward, but it's essential for enabling apples to spawn in the future. This means that if we don’t clean dirt, apples may not appear at all — or may be absent in key areas. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt), cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple availability. Without this, the group’s long-term goal of maximizing apple intake is unattainable.

3. **Where to explore?**  
   There’s no immediate interest nearby — the observation says "you see nothing of interest." However, the global

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (4, 8). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: Given the current situation, let's analyze the trade-offs carefully:

- You are at (4, 8).  
- The nearest apple is at (1, 8), which is only 3 steps away — a very short distance.  
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 0), which is 11 steps away — far from your current position.  
- Apples only spawn *when the river is clean*, meaning cleaning dirt is necessary to enable future apple spawning.  
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately, which is a clear reward.  
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward but is essential for long-term apple availability.  

### Key Observations:
1. **Immediate Reward vs. Long-Term Benefit**:  
   - Eating the apple at (1, 8) provides a direct, tangible point.  
   - Cleaning dirt at (7, 0) would require significant movement and time, and since apples currently exist (and are reachable), the group likely already has a path to apples.  
   - Since apples are already spawning (implied by their presence), cleaning dirt may not be *necessary* right now — the system may already be in a state where apples are available.

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (10, 7). You see dirt at (8, 7).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (8, 7).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 3 units away — reachable, but not immediately close.
- The nearest dirt is at (8, 7), just 2 units away from my current position (10, 7). This means I can reach it in two moves (left to (9,7), then to (8,7)) — a very short and efficient action.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 point, but there are no apples visible in the immediate vicinity. The apple at (13,7) is distant and may not spawn unless the river is clean.
- Crucially, the rule states: *Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (less dirt = more apples)*. This means cleaning dirt is not just a maintenance task — it's a prerequisite for apple spawning. Without cleaning, future apple opportunities are blocked.
- Since we are in a cleanup game where long-term success depends on enabling apple spawns, and the dirt is very close and easily accessible, cleaning it now is a strategic investment in future rewards.
- There’s no immediate apple available to eat, and moving
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 7}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (3, 1). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I am at (3, 1). The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away — a significant distance. The nearest dirt is at (7, 0), also 5 units away. There is no immediate apple in sight, and no visible dirt to clean nearby.

Now, evaluating the trade-offs:

1. **Eat an apple?**  
   There is no apple visible at my current location. The nearest apple is far away, and I have no way of knowing if it will spawn or if I can reach it without first cleaning the river. Eating an apple would require movement to (2,5), which is not feasible without first ensuring the river is clean — because apples only spawn when the river is clean. Since the river is currently dirty (dirt at (7,0)), apples are not spawning. Therefore, **I cannot eat an apple now**, and attempting to go to (2,5) without cleaning would be futile — the apple may not even exist.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   This is a critical point. Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apple spawning. The dirt at (7,0)
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (3, 8). You see an apple at (1, 8).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 8).

Reasoning:

- The apple at (1, 8) is within reach — only 2 steps away (one step left to (2,8), then one more to (1,8)). This is a short, immediate action that gives me +1.0 point directly.
- The nearest dirt is at (8, 7), which is 6 steps away. Cleaning it would require significant movement and time, and there’s no immediate benefit or reward from cleaning dirt — it only enables future apple spawning, which is a long-term, uncertain gain.
- Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, the dirt cleaning is necessary for future apple generation, but it doesn’t help *now*. In a game where immediate rewards are scored directly (and apples are the only source of points), maximizing short-term gains is optimal unless we have a clear, high-impact long-term strategy.
- There is no indication that the dirt at (8,7) is critical or that future apples are guaranteed — just that they spawn when the river is clean. Without knowing the probability or timing of future apple spawns, it’s risky to invest effort in cleaning something so far away.
- The current situation gives a
- Since the dirt is adjacent and cleaning it is a low-cost, high-impact action, it makes sense to prioritize it over eating an apple that

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4) — the nearest dirt patch, which is only 2 steps away.

Here’s the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 steps away — quite far. Eating it would give a +1.0 reward, but it requires traversing a long path and likely passing through areas that may not be clean yet.
- However, apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning. If we don’t clean dirt, no apples will appear, regardless of how far we go. This is a critical dependency.
- Right now, there is dirt at (7, 4), just 2 steps from my current position (7, 2). I can move to (7, 3) — which is where agent 1 is — then to (7, 4), clean it, and then proceed.
- Agent 1 is at (7, 3), so I can either coordinate or move past them. Since I’m not told that agent 1 is blocking or hostile, and no rules prohibit movement, I can safely move to (7, 4) to clean.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away. To reach it, I’d need to move through several cells, and there’s currently no indication that any apples are spawning due to clean land. Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning when dirt is removed. Since dirt exists at (7, 4), the environment is not yet conducive to apple spawning.
- Cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple generation. Even though cleaning provides no immediate reward, it enables future apple spawning, which directly increases the group’s total points. This aligns with the long-term goal of maximizing points through sustainable resource access.
- The dirt is only 1 unit away (directly above at (7, 4)), making it extremely easy to clean. This is a low-effort, high-impact action that improves the environment for future apple access.
- Eating an apple now would give a +1.0 immediate reward, but if the dirt remains, no apples will spawn in the future — and the nearest apple (at (2,5)) may be inaccessible or unspawning due to the polluted environment. Thus, the apple at

--- Step 19 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am at (7, 3). Agent 2 is at (7, 2), directly above me. There is dirt at (7, 4), directly to my right. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 steps away. The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 step away — very close.

Key points:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean. Dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning — which benefits the group.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately, which is a direct point gain.
- I cannot move diagonally — so movement is restricted to up/down/left/right.

Right now, there is no apple visible in my immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is 6 steps away, and there’s no indication that apple spawning has already started. The dirt at (7, 4) is the only obstacle preventing apple spawning — and it’s only 1 step away.

So, should I eat an apple now?  
No. There is no apple at (7, 3) or nearby. I

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision as Agent 2.

Current position: (7, 2)  
Agent 1 is at (7, 3) — directly above me, so we're in close proximity.  
Nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 steps away.  
Nearest dirt is at (7, 4), just one step above me — distance 1 (since (7,4) is adjacent).  

Wait — the global scan says "Nearest Dirt: at (7, 4), distance 2". That seems inconsistent. From (7,2) to (7,4) is only two steps vertically — so distance 2 is correct. So dirt is at (7,4), two steps away.  

Now, key trade-offs:

1. **Eat an apple?**  
   - The nearest apple is at (12,2), 5 steps away. That’s far.  
   - There's no apple at (7,2) or nearby.  
   - Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately, but only if it's available.  
   - Since no apple is visible at current position, and the nearest is

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away — a significant distance. Given that apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), and currently there is dirt at (7, 4), we are not yet in a state where apples can spawn.
- Eating an apple now would give a +1.0 reward, but since no apples are currently spawning due to the presence of dirt, there is no apple available to eat at this moment. The observation says "you see dirt at (7, 4)" — this implies the apple is not currently accessible.
- Cleaning the dirt at (7, 4) is a necessary step to enable future apple spawning. Once dirt is removed, the environment becomes cleaner, and apples can appear. This action, while not giving immediate reward, is essential for long-term progress and group success.
- There is no immediate apple available to eat, and the nearest apple is far away (distance 5), meaning it won’t spawn unless the river is clean.
- Therefore, the only logical and beneficial action is to clean the dirt at (7, 4), which will eventually

  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to make the best decision for maximizing points while considering both immediate and long-term gains.

Current position: (7, 3)  
Agent 2 is at (7, 2) — directly above me, so we're in the same vertical column.  
Dirt is at (7, 4) — directly to my right (east).  
Nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away (distance = 6).  
Nearest dirt is at (7, 4), distance = 1 — very close.

Key points:
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning — which is essential for long-term point accumulation.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately, but only if an apple is present and accessible.
- There is no apple visible in the current vicinity — the nearest is far at (12, 2), and it's not guaranteed to be spawnable unless the river is clean.

But here's the crucial detail: **There is no apple currently visible or accessible near me.** The nearest apple is at
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the current situation to make the best decision.

I am at (7, 2), and I see Agent 1 at (7, 3) — directly above me. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away. That means I would need to move right to reach it. The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), just one step above me — a distance of only 2 units.

Key points:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed).
- Currently, there is dirt at (7, 4), which is very close — only 2 steps away.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately, but only if it's already present.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward but enables future apple spawning — crucial for long-term group success.
- The apple at (12, 2) is far away, and there's no indication it will spawn unless the river is clean.

Important trade-off:
Wait — the global scan says "Nearest Apple: at (2,1)" — this implies it's already there. So if

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (4, 5). You see an apple at (2, 5).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (2, 5).

Reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only 2 steps away — a short, direct path (moving left twice: (4,5) → (3,5) → (2,5)).
- There is no immediate dirt to clean nearby. The nearest dirt is at (7,3), which is 5 steps away — far from the current position and not accessible without significant travel.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward and requires effort without any current benefit. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and we currently have an apple already available, there's no urgent need to clean dirt now.
- The immediate reward of +1.0 for eating the apple is valuable and achievable with minimal cost. It also increases my score without delaying progress or risking missed opportunities.
- There is no indication that future apple spawning depends on immediate action. The global scan shows apples are not currently sparse — one is already visible and reachable.

Therefore, the best trade-off is to eat the apple now. This maximizes immediate score and does not sacrifice any necessary long-term goals. Cleaning dirt can be considered later when more apples are needed or when the dirt is closer. For now, prioritize available, accessible

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (3, 1). You see an apple at (1, 0), an apple at (2, 1) and agent 2 at (4, 1).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (2, 1).

Reasoning:

- The apple at (2, 1) is directly adjacent to my current position (3, 1), meaning I can reach it in one move. This provides an immediate +1.0 point, which is a direct and valuable reward.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 3), which is 6 units away. Cleaning it would require a significant amount of movement and time, and there is no immediate benefit to doing so—apples only spawn when the river is clean, but we don’t currently have a spawn point or known apple location tied to the dirt. Without a clear path or immediate need to clean, this action is not urgent or efficient.
- Agent 2 is at (4, 1), which is just one step away from me. While they may be a potential threat or competitor, there’s no indication they are blocking access to the apple or that they are actively trying to prevent me from eating it. In the absence of conflict or threat, I can safely move toward the apple.
- There is no indication that cleaning dirt will yield immediate or meaningful rewards in the short term, and since apples are already visible and accessible, the immediate reward of eating
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 2, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Moving from (4, 1) towards (3, 1).
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (4, 1). You see an apple at (2, 1) and agent 1 at (3, 1).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (2, 1).

Reasoning:

- The apple at (2, 1) is directly within reach — only 2 steps away (moving left to (3,1), then to (2,1)). Since I'm currently at (4,1), I can move to (3,1) and then to (2,1) in two moves. This is a very short path and provides an immediate +1.0 point.
  
- The dirt at (7,3) is far away (distance 5), and cleaning it would require a significant time investment. There's no immediate benefit to cleaning it — apples only spawn when the river is clean, but the current apple at (2,1) is already present and accessible. Cleaning dirt is a long-term, indirect action with no immediate reward, and it doesn't address the current need for points.

- There is no immediate threat or obstacle from Agent 1 at (3,1). They are at a position adjacent to the apple, but they don’t appear to be blocking movement — I can move to (3,1) and then to (2,1) safely. If Agent 1 is not already eating the apple, I can act
  Decision: {'action': 'move_to', 'args': {'coord_x': 3, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (3, 5). You see an apple at (2, 5).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (2, 5).

Reasoning:

- The apple is directly adjacent (distance 1), making it immediately accessible and within my current position at (3, 5). Eating it gives a clear, immediate +1.0 reward with no risk or cost.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 3), which is 6 units away — far from current position and not a near-term priority. Cleaning dirt would require a significant movement cost and does not yield immediate benefit. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and we currently have an apple already available, there's no urgent need to clean dirt now.
- There's no indication of other nearby resources or threats. The apple is the only actionable item in the immediate vicinity.
- In a cleanup game, while long-term environmental improvement (cleaning dirt) is important, the primary goal is to maximize points. Since we already have a nearby apple, and the dirt is far away, acting immediately to gain points is the most efficient strategy.

Therefore, I should eat the apple at (2, 5) to gain immediate points, and later plan a route to clean dirt when necessary, once I have a better understanding of the environment and resource distribution. This balances

--- Step 20 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 1). You see an apple at (1, 0), an apple at (2, 1) and agent 2 at (3, 1).
  Thinking: I am at (2, 1), and I can immediately see an apple at (2, 1) — that’s right next to me. This means I can eat it for a +1.0 reward with no cost or risk. 

Let’s evaluate the options:

1. **Eat the apple at (2, 1)**  
   - Immediate reward: +1.0 point.  
   - No risk — it's directly available.  
   - The apple is already spawning because the river is currently clean (as per global scan, no dirt is blocking apple spawning).  
   - Eating it doesn’t harm anything; it just consumes a resource.  

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning**  
   - The nearest dirt is at (7, 3), which is 7 units away.  
   - Cleaning dirt requires movement and time.  
   - There is no immediate benefit — apples only spawn when the river is clean, and currently, the river *is* clean (implied by the presence of apples).  
   - Since apples are already spawning, and I’m already at a spawn point, cleaning dirt is not urgent.  
   - Additionally, the global scan indicates that the nearest dirt is far away —
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 2, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'eat'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (3, 1). You see an apple at (1, 0), an apple at (2, 1) and agent 1 at (2, 1).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (2, 1).

Reasoning:

- The apple at (2, 1) is directly adjacent (distance 1), meaning I can reach it immediately without any movement cost.
- There is an agent (Agent 1) already at (2, 1), which means the apple is already occupied. This suggests that eating it would be impossible or that the apple may be in use — possibly blocked or already claimed.
- Since I cannot move diagonally and the only available apple is at (2, 1), which is occupied, I cannot safely eat it without risk of conflict or losing the apple.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 3), which is far away (distance 6), so cleaning it will not provide immediate benefit and requires significant movement.
- There is no other apple visible in the current observation, and no indication that dirt cleaning will spawn apples in the near term.
- In a cleanup game where apples only spawn when the river is clean, cleaning dirt is a long-term strategy. However, without any immediate need or access to dirt, and with no other apples available, the immediate reward from an apple is not possible due to occupation.
  Obs: You are at (4, 5). You see an apple at (2, 5).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (2, 5).

Here's the reasoning:

- The apple is at (2, 5), which is only 2 steps away — a very short distance. Since I can only move in cardinal directions (up, down, left, right), reaching it is straightforward and requires minimal effort.
- Eating an apple gives me +1.0 point immediately, which is a direct and tangible reward. This is valuable in a game where immediate gains are important for scoring.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 3), which is 5 steps away — far from my current position. Cleaning it would require significant movement and time, and since there are no apples currently spawning (due to the river being dirty), the future benefit of cleaning is uncertain and delayed.
- There is no indication that apple spawning is imminent or that the dirt is critical to the current environment. Without a clear need to clean for immediate apple generation, the long-term benefit is speculative.
- In a cleanup game where immediate rewards are possible and future rewards are uncertain, it's rational to prioritize what is available now.

Therefore, eating the apple now maximizes immediate points and aligns with the goal of maximizing points. Cleaning dirt should be considered only if apples are

--- Step 19 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (3, 1). You see an apple at (1, 0) and an apple at (2, 1).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (2, 1).

Reasoning:

- The apple at (2, 1) is directly adjacent to my current position (3, 1), meaning I can reach it in one move. This gives me an immediate +1.0 reward with no risk or cost.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 3), which is 6 units away. Cleaning it would require multiple moves and no immediate reward. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, this is a long-term strategy that does not provide any benefit in the current state.
- There are no other nearby apples or dirt to consider. The apple at (1, 0) is farther away (distance 2), and would require a longer path without any immediate benefit.
- In a cleanup game where immediate rewards are available and future rewards depend on conditions (like clean rivers), it is optimal to prioritize immediate gains when they are accessible and feasible.
- Since the dirt is far away and cleaning it does not currently enable any apple spawning (apples only spawn *when* the river is clean), and we have a nearby apple, acting now maximizes immediate utility and aligns with the goal of maximizing points.

Therefore, I should eat the apple at
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 2, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 1). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision.

Currently, I'm at (6, 1). The nearest apple is at (2, 1), which is 4 units away — a considerable distance. Eating that apple would give me +1.0 immediate reward. However, apples only spawn when the river is clean, meaning that dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning. Right now, there is dirt at (7, 3), which is only 3 units away — much closer than the apple.

This suggests a critical trade-off:

- **Option 1: Eat the apple at (2, 1)**  
  → Immediate +1.0 point.  
  → But this apple may not be sustainable — if the river is still dirty, it might not spawn again, or future apples may not appear.  
  → Also, I’m far from the dirt, so I can't clean it to improve future apple availability.

- **Option 2: Clean the dirt at (7, 3)**  
  → No immediate reward.  
  → But this action makes the river cleaner, which enables future apple spawning.  
  → Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for long
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 3}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (3, 5). You see an apple at (2, 5).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (2, 5).

Reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available at distance 1 — this is a direct, low-effort opportunity for +1.0 point, which contributes directly to my score.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 3), which is 6 units away. Cleaning it would require a significant journey and provides no immediate reward. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, cleaning dirt is a long-term strategy, but it doesn’t guarantee apple spawning — and even if it does, the benefit is delayed.
- There is no indication that the dirt is currently blocking apple spawning or that the river is in a state where cleaning is urgent. The current environment already has an apple visible and reachable.
- In a cleanup game where immediate rewards are possible and future rewards are uncertain and far off, prioritizing immediate action (eating the apple) is more efficient and aligns with maximizing points in the short term.
- There’s no risk in eating the apple — it’s safe, it’s within reach, and it gives a clear point.

Therefore, the optimal choice is to eat the apple at (2, 5) now, and later — if possible — plan a route to clean dirt when more

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 1). You see an apple at (1, 0) and an apple at (2, 1).
  Thinking: I am at (2, 1), and I immediately see an apple at (2, 1) — that’s a distance of 0. This means I can eat it right now for a +1.0 reward with no cost.

Let’s analyze the trade-off:

1. **Eat the apple at (2, 1)**  
   - Immediate reward: +1.0  
   - No risk — it's right where I am.  
   - The apple is already present, so it doesn’t require any prior cleaning.  
   - This action gives me a clear, instant benefit.

2. **Clean dirt at (7, 3)**  
   - Distance is 7 — a significant journey.  
   - Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward.  
   - The benefit is future: more apples may spawn when the river is clean.  
   - However, since there are already apples available now, and no indication that future apple spawning is currently blocked, the long-term benefit is uncertain.  
   - Moreover, the group's benefit is only relevant if apples are not spawning now — but we already have apples visible.

3. **Explore elsewhere**  
   - There are no other apples or dirt nearby.  
   - The nearest

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 1). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision.

Current position: (7, 1)  
Nearest apple: (2, 1) — distance 5  
Nearest dirt: (7, 3) — distance 2  

Key facts:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned).
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward but enables future apple spawning.
- I cannot move diagonally — only up, down, left, right.

Observation: There is no visible apple nearby. The nearest apple is 5 steps away, and I’m at (7,1). The nearest dirt is only 2 steps away — at (7,3). That means I can reach the dirt quickly and clean it, which would eventually allow apples to spawn.

But should I eat an apple now? The apple at (2,1) is far away — 5 steps. I’d need to move to (2,1), which requires a path through possibly dirty terrain. However, if the river is not clean, no apples spawn at all. So unless the river is clean, there are no apples to eat.

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 0). You see agent 2 at (6, 1).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 3), even though it doesn't give immediate reward.

Here's why:

- The nearest apple is at (1, 0), which is 5 units away — far from where I am at (6, 0). Eating it would require significant movement and likely would not be efficient given the distance.
- The nearest dirt is at (6, 3), only 3 units away — very close and directly in my line of sight.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed). So, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple spawning.
- Since I'm already at (6, 0), moving to (6, 1) to (6, 2) to (6, 3) is a straight, diagonal-free path (no diagonal movement allowed, but vertical/horizontal only — so this is valid).
- Cleaning dirt enables future apple spawns, which benefits the group (including me), as apples are the only source of points.
- There is no immediate benefit to eating an apple now — it's far away and requires a long journey.
- If I don't clean the dirt, future apple spawning is blocked, and the group may not

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 1). You see agent 1 at (6, 0).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision.

Currently, I am at (6, 1), and I see Agent 1 at (6, 0). The nearest apple is at (2, 1), which is 4 units away — that’s a significant distance. The nearest dirt is at (6, 3), just 2 units away. 

Now, let’s break down the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward**:  
   The apple at (2,1) is far away — I would need to move left to (5,1), then (4,1), (3,1), (2,1). That’s 4 steps. There’s no apple nearby (within 1 or 2 steps) that I can reach immediately. Eating one would give +1.0 point, but it would require a long path, and I don’t know if there are more apples nearby or if the river will remain clean. Also, since apples only spawn when the river is clean, if I don’t clean dirt, future apples may not appear — so this action could be short-sighted.

2. **Clean the dirt at (6,3)**:  
   This is only
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 3}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Moving from (1, 8) towards (2, 5).
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (1, 8). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the trade-off between immediate reward and long-term benefits.

Right now, I'm at (1, 8). The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 4 units away — that's a reasonable distance, but not close. I can reach it by moving down to (2, 5) via (1,7), (1,6), (1,5), (2,5). However, the nearest dirt is at (6, 3), which is 10 units away — quite far.

The key rule is: **Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (less dirt = more apples).** So cleaning dirt enables future apple spawning, which benefits the group. But cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward — only indirect benefit.

Now, let's consider the options:

1. **Eat an apple immediately?**  
   The nearest apple is 4 units away — I can reach it in a few steps. Eating it gives +1.0 point immediately. But if I don’t clean dirt, future apples may not spawn — and the group may not have access to apples at all. So while this gives immediate reward, it’s a short-term gain with long-term risk.

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 1). You see agent 2 at (6, 2).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am at (6, 1), and I see Agent 2 at (6, 2). This means we are adjacent vertically — a potential coordination or conflict point. The nearest apple is at (2, 1), which is 4 units away. That’s a significant distance, and since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), I can’t just eat an apple now unless it's already available.

But here's the key: the nearest dirt is at (6, 3), which is only 2 units away from me. That means I can clean it in two moves: (6,1) → (6,2) → (6,3). After cleaning that dirt, the river becomes cleaner, which increases the chance of apples spawning in the future — especially at (2,1) or nearby.

Right now, there are no apples visible in the immediate vicinity. So, eating an apple now would be impossible — no apple is at my current location or reachable in one move. Therefore, option 1 (eating an apple for immediate reward) is not viable.

Option 2 (cleaning dirt to enable future apple

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 2). You see agent 1 at (6, 1) and dirt at (6, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully.

I am at (6, 2). Agent 1 is at (6, 1), directly above me. There is dirt at (6, 3), directly to my right — a distance of 1 step away. The nearest apple is at (2, 1), which is 5 steps away (a long distance). 

Key facts:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned).
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but enables future apple spawning.
- I can only move in cardinal directions (up, down, left, right), not diagonally.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.

Right now, there is dirt at (6, 3), which is just one step away. This is the only dirt in the global scan. If I clean it, I will remove a dirt block, making the river cleaner — which increases the chance of apples spawning in the future.

However, there are no apples currently visible nearby — the nearest apple is at (2, 1), which is 5 steps away. That means I cannot eat an apple immediately unless I move there and find one. But since apples only spawn when

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 8). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to analyze the trade-off carefully given the current situation.

I am at (2, 8). The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is only 3 units away — a very short distance. That means I can reach it in a few moves (moving down 3 units to (2, 5)) without any obstacles or risks. Eating an apple gives me +1.0 immediately, which is a direct and valuable reward.

However, the nearest dirt is at (6, 3), which is 9 units away — far from my current position. Cleaning dirt would require a long journey and no immediate benefit. Moreover, apples only spawn when the river is clean, which implies that dirt cleaning is a prerequisite for apple availability — but only in the long term. Since the apple at (2, 5) is already present and reachable, and the dirt is far away, cleaning it now would not immediately enable any apple spawning, and would delay access to the current apple.

Also, the observation says "you see nothing of interest nearby" — suggesting no immediate threats or rewards. So there's no urgent need to explore new areas. The apple at (2, 5) is both visible and accessible.

Therefore, the immediate

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 2). You see dirt at (6, 3), agent 2 at (6, 3) and dirt at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 3).

Here’s the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 1), which is 5 units away. That means it's not immediately accessible — I’d need to move through several tiles to reach it. There’s no apple currently visible in my immediate vicinity, and the only apple spawn condition is when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is removed).
- The dirt at (6, 3) is directly adjacent to me at (6, 2), and agent 2 is also at (6, 3). This suggests that (6, 3) is a critical point — it's both a dirt location and currently occupied by another agent. Cleaning it would not only improve the river's cleanliness (enabling future apple spawning) but also potentially free up space or create a path for movement or cooperation.
- Eating an apple now is not feasible because there is no apple in sight — the nearest one is far away. Even if I could reach it, I’d need to first clean dirt to allow apples to spawn in the first place. Without clean river segments, apples won’t appear at all.
   The dirt at (7

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here’s the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away. That’s a significant distance, and we don’t have any immediate access to apples nearby. Eating it would give +1.0 point, but it would be a long journey with no guarantee of success — and more importantly, apples only spawn *when the river is clean*. This means that apples are not guaranteed to be present unless we clean the dirt.

- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 unit away — very close. Cleaning it would make the environment cleaner, which directly enables future apple spawning. This action has no immediate reward, but it's essential for long-term success. Without cleaning dirt, apples won’t spawn, meaning we’ll be stuck in a loop of not being able to earn points.

- The trade-off between immediate reward and long-term sustainability is clear: eating an apple now would give a small, temporary gain, but if we don’t clean the dirt, future apple spawns are blocked entirely. Since apples are the only source of points, and they depend on clean conditions, this is a strategic investment in enabling future rewards.

- There’s no nearby

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here's my reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — quite far. Eating it immediately would give only +1.0 point, but the path to it would require navigating through or around the dirt at (7, 4), which is currently blocking clean land access.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is very close — only 1 unit away — and cleaning it is a prerequisite for apples to spawn on that land. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt), removing this dirt enables future apple spawning, which benefits the entire group.
- There is no immediate apple nearby that I can eat without first addressing the dirt. Eating an apple now would be inefficient and would not contribute to long-term apple availability.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it enables future rewards. In a cleanup game where cooperation and sustainability matter, this is a strategic investment.
- Since I am at (7, 3) and agent 2 is at (7, 2), I can move to (7, 4) to clean it without conflict — it's adjacent and directly reachable in one move
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am at (7, 2), and I see Agent 1 at (7, 3) — directly above me. That means we are aligned vertically, and the river is likely in this area. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — a moderate distance. However, the nearest dirt is at (7, 4), just one step above me, at a distance of only 2. That means I can reach it in two moves: move up to (7, 3), then to (7, 4).

Crucially, the rules state that **apples only spawn on land when the river is clean** — meaning cleaning dirt is necessary to enable future apple spawning. While eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately, cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward but enables future apple growth, which benefits the group.

Right now, there is no apple at my current position or nearby. The apple at (12, 2) is far away and likely won't spawn unless the river is clean. Since the dirt is very close (only 2 steps away), I can clean it quickly — in two moves —

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here’s the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away — a significant distance. Eating it would give +1.0 point immediately, but it's not a nearby or urgent reward.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 unit away — the closest dirt to me. This means it's within immediate reach.
- The core rule states: *Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (less dirt = more apples)*. So, cleaning dirt is not just a passive action — it enables future apple spawning. This directly supports the group's long-term goal of maximizing apple consumption.
- There is no immediate benefit to eating an apple now, especially since it's far away and the path to it requires navigating through potentially dirty terrain. Moreover, the dirt at (7, 4) is directly adjacent, making it a low-effort, high-impact action.
- Since I cannot move diagonally, I can only move up/down/left/right. Cleaning the dirt at (7, 4) requires just one move (up or down? Wait — (7,5) to (7,4) is

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — far enough that immediate consumption would not be efficient.
- There is dirt at (7, 4), just one step away from my current position (7, 3). Cleaning this dirt is a low-effort, high-impact action that enables future apple spawning.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned to allow apples to appear. Without cleaning, no apples will spawn, regardless of how far I go.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 reward, but that apple may not exist at all if the river remains dirty. Since apples are not currently spawning, the chance of finding one is zero — so eating one now is not possible or meaningful.
- Cleaning the dirt at (7, 4) is a necessary step to enable future apple spawning. This action supports the group’s long-term goal and increases the probability of future rewards.
- I cannot move diagonally, so I can only move up, down, left, or right. Moving to (7, 4) to clean it is a simple, direct action
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to determine the best course of action.

Current position: (7, 2)  
Agent 1 is at (7, 3) — directly above me, so we're in close proximity.  
Nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — that's a decent distance, but reachable.  
Nearest dirt is at (7, 4), just one step up from me — distance 2.  

Key insight: Apples only spawn when the river is clean. Dirt removal is not rewarding immediately, but it enables future apple spawning. Since apples are essential for point accumulation and the group's success, the long-term benefit of cleaning dirt must be weighed against immediate gains.

Let’s evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple immediately?**  
   There is no apple at my current location. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 steps away. I cannot eat an apple unless I reach it. So, eating an apple is not possible right now. This option is invalid.

2. **Clean the dirt at (7, 4)?**  
   This is only 2 steps away — very accessible. Cleaning dirt is
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away. That means it's not immediately accessible and requires a path through potentially dirty terrain.
- The only dirt currently visible is at (7, 4), just one step away from my current position (7, 5). This is a very short and feasible action.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be removed to enable apple spawning. Since apples are currently not spawning (as no apples are visible in the global scan), cleaning dirt is a necessary precondition for future apple generation.
- Eating an apple now would give a +1.0 immediate reward, but if we don’t clean the dirt, future apple spawns will be blocked, and the group will miss opportunities for long-term gains.
- Since we are in a cleanup game, the primary goal is not just immediate reward but enabling sustainable apple generation. Cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for that.
- There is no nearby apple visible, and the nearest apple is far away. Without cleaning dirt, we may never be able to access apples at all, especially if dirt blocks paths or prevents spawning.


--- Step 20 ---
Moving from (10, 7) towards (9, 7).
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (10, 7). You see agent 3 at (9, 8).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 8), even though it offers no immediate reward.

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 3 units away — reachable, but not immediately adjacent. Eating it would give +1.0 point, but only if I can reach it safely and efficiently.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 8), which is 4 units away. Cleaning it is not immediate, but it's essential for enabling future apple spawning. Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed). This means that without cleaning dirt, apples won’t appear — so the long-term reward (more apples for the group) is blocked.
- I am currently at (10, 7), and agent 3 is at (9, 8). That position is close to the dirt at (7, 8), but not directly adjacent. I need to move toward it to clean it.
- Moving to clean dirt requires a path: from (10,7) → (9,7) → (8,7) → (7,7) → (7,8). This path is valid and avoids diagonal movement.
-
  Decision: {'action': 'move_to', 'args': {'coord_x': 9, 'coord_y': 7}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 1). You see dirt at (7, 0).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully.

I am at (6, 1). The nearest dirt is at (7, 0), which is only one step away — a very short distance. This dirt is directly adjacent, so cleaning it would be a quick, low-effort action. 

Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning that dirt must be removed to enable apples to appear. Right now, there's no apple visible in immediate range (the nearest is at (12, 2), 7 steps away), and no indication that apples are currently spawning. So, without cleaning dirt, there will be no apples to eat.

Eating an apple now would give +1.0 point, but if I eat one now, I’m essentially ignoring the fact that apples depend on clean land. If I don’t clean the dirt at (7, 0), then no apples will spawn — including the one at (12, 2) — which could mean long-term failure to earn points.

Moreover, since I’m at (6, 1), and the dirt is at (7, 0), I can move to (7, 0) in one step (down-right is not allowed, but moving to (

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (9, 8). You see agent 1 at (10, 7) and dirt at (7, 8).
  Thinking: I am Agent 3, currently at (9, 8). I observe that:

- There is a dirt patch at (7, 8), which is only 2 units away — very close and directly accessible.
- The nearest apple is at (13, 8), 4 units away — not immediately reachable without first addressing the dirt.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean, meaning dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning. This is a prerequisite for future apple availability.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately, but only if an apple is present.
- Currently, there are no visible apples in the immediate vicinity. The apple at (13, 8) is not spawnable unless the river is clean.

**Key Insight:**  
There is no apple currently available for immediate consumption. The apple at (13, 8) cannot spawn unless the dirt at (7, 8) is cleaned. Since the dirt is only 2 units away, it is within easy reach.

**Trade-off Analysis:**
- Option 1 (Eat an apple): Not feasible — no apple is present at (9, 8) or nearby. No immediate reward.
- Option 2 (Clean dirt): This

--- Step 21 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (9, 7). You see dirt at (7, 8) and agent 3 at (8, 8).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am currently at (9, 7). The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 4 steps away — reachable in a straight line (moving right). However, the nearest dirt is at (7, 8), which is only 3 steps away (left and up), and that dirt is currently blocking apple spawning. Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning that cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple growth.

Right now, I can see agent 3 at (8, 8), which is adjacent to the dirt at (7,8). That suggests agent 3 may be trying to clean or interact with the dirt. But since I’m not told that agent 3 has cleaned it, and no information about dirt status or cleaning success is provided, I must assume that dirt remains uncleaned unless actively cleaned by an agent.

Key trade-offs:
- **Option 1: Eat an apple** → Immediate +1.0 reward. But the nearest apple is 4 steps away. I can reach it, but only if I don’t block progress toward cleaning dirt. However, eating an apple doesn’t help with cleaning dirt or future

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 1). You see dirt at (7, 0).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 0).

Here's the reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 steps away — quite distant.
- The dirt at (7, 0) is directly adjacent and only 1 step away. Cleaning it will improve the river's cleanliness, which increases the chance of apples spawning in the future.
- Eating an apple now would give a +1.0 reward, but there are no apples nearby to eat. The apple at (12, 2) is far away and likely won't spawn until the river is clean — so no immediate benefit from eating now.
- Cleaning dirt has no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning, which is essential for long-term point accumulation and group success.
- Since I cannot move diagonally, the only efficient path is to move to (7, 0) and clean it. This is a small, low-risk action with high strategic value.

Therefore, the optimal choice is to clean the dirt at (7, 0) — it supports future apple spawning and aligns with the goal of maximizing points over time, rather than risking a wasted move to an unreachable

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 8). You see agent 1 at (9, 7) and dirt at (7, 8).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am at (8, 8). The nearest apple is at (13, 8), which is 5 units away — a reasonable distance but not immediate. There is dirt at (7, 8), just one step away, and I can reach it directly. 

Now, let's evaluate the options:

1. **Eating an apple for immediate reward**:  
   There is no apple visible in my immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is 5 steps away, and I have no information about whether apples are currently spawning. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is removed), and currently there is dirt at (7,8), no apples are spawning — so I cannot eat an apple now. Therefore, eating an apple is not possible right now. This option is invalid.

2. **Cleaning dirt to enable future apple spawning**:  
   The dirt at (7,8) is directly adjacent to me (I am at (8,8), so it's one step left). Cleaning this dirt would make the river cleaner, which would allow apples to spawn in the future — especially since the nearest apple is at (13,8), which

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 7). You see dirt at (7, 8) and agent 3 at (7, 8).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am at (8, 7).  
There is dirt at (7, 8), which is just one step away (distance 1), and agent 3 is currently standing there.  
The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 5 steps away.  
The dirt at (7, 8) is the nearest dirt available — it's within reach, and cleaning it would allow apples to spawn in the future, which benefits the group.

Now, evaluating the options:

1. **Eat an apple immediately** — There is no apple nearby. The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 5 steps away. I cannot eat an apple without first moving to it. Since I’m currently at (8, 7), and no apple is in immediate vicinity, eating one now is not possible. So this option is not viable.

  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away — quite far and not immediately accessible. Eating it now would give only a +1.0 reward, but it's not a strategic or urgent choice given the current state.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 unit away — extremely close. Cleaning it will improve the river's cleanliness, which directly enables future apple spawning. This is a critical prerequisite for apples to appear at all.
- The game's mechanics state that apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. So, without cleaning dirt, no apples will appear — even if we move toward them. This makes cleaning a prerequisite for long-term success.
- There is no immediate benefit to eating an apple now, because even if we eat it, the river remains dirty, and future apple spawns are still blocked. This would be a short-term gain with no long-term payoff.
- Cleaning dirt is a necessary investment with no immediate reward, but it enables future rewards. This aligns with the goal of maximizing points over time, not just immediate gratification.

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am at (7, 3). Agent 2 is at (7, 2), directly above me. There is dirt at (7, 4), directly to my right. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 steps away. The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 step away — very close.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple** — There's no apple visible at my current location. The nearest apple is 6 steps away, and I don't see any apples in the immediate vicinity. Eating an apple would require moving to it, which means I'd have to walk through potentially dirty terrain or risk missing the opportunity to clean dirt that could spawn apples. Since there's no apple nearby, eating one now would be inefficient and not optimal.

2. **Clean the dirt at (7, 4)** — This is a critical action. Dirt removal is necessary to enable apple spawning. Right now, the river is dirty at (7, 4), which likely prevents apples from spawning in that area or nearby. Cleaning this dirt would improve the environment for future apple growth. Since

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am at (7, 2), and I see Agent 1 at (7, 3) — directly above me. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away. That means I would need to move right along the row to reach it. The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), just one step above me — distance 2. Cleaning dirt is essential because only when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt) do apples spawn. So cleaning dirt enables future apple spawning, which benefits the group.

Now, the trade-off:

1. **Eating an apple for immediate reward**: The apple at (12, 2) is 5 steps away — a significant distance. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and the dirt is nearby (just 2 steps away), I could clean the dirt first and then potentially spawn more apples in the future. Eating an apple now would give me +1.0, but if I don’t clean the dirt, future apple spawning is blocked. That means I might miss out on more apples later.

2. **Cleaning dirt to enable future apple spawning**: The

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away. That means it's not immediately accessible, and even if I could reach it, there's no guarantee it will be there long-term — apples only spawn when the river is clean. 
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 unit away — extremely close. Cleaning it would make the river cleaner, which increases the likelihood of apples spawning in the future, especially at locations like (2, 5) or nearby.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 point, but apples only spawn when the river is clean. Since the river currently has dirt, apples are not spawning — so there's no apple to eat at this moment. The apple at (2, 5) is not currently available because the environment isn't clean enough.
- The group's long-term success depends on cleaning dirt to enable apple spawning. This is a foundational action — without cleaning, apples won’t appear, and the game becomes unproductive.
- Since I am at (7, 5) and dirt is at (7, 4), I can move one step north

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here’s the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away. To reach it, I’d need to move through several tiles, and currently, there’s no apple spawning because the river is dirty (dirt at (7,4) is blocking apple generation).
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning, dirt must be removed to enable apple spawning. Since there’s dirt at (7,4) and it's only 1 unit away from my current position (7,3), cleaning it is both feasible and efficient.
- Eating an apple now is not possible because no apple is visible in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is far away and currently not spawning due to the dirty river.
- Cleaning the dirt gives no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning — which is essential for long-term point accumulation and group success.
- Since I cannot move diagonally, the path to clean the dirt is straightforward: move to (7,4) and clean it. This action is low-cost and high-impact for enabling future apple generation.
- Once the dirt is cleaned, apples may spawn in the area, and eventually,

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4), which is only 2 steps away.

Here's why:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 steps away — a significant distance. Even if I could reach it, there's no guarantee it will spawn unless the river is clean.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is very close — only 1 step from my current position (7, 2). Cleaning it will improve the river's cleanliness, enabling future apple spawning.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean. Without cleaning dirt, no apples will appear, regardless of how far I walk.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 reward, but if the river remains dirty, no future apples will appear — meaning the immediate reward is wasted.
- Cleaning dirt has no immediate reward, but it enables future apple generation for the group. Since the goal is to maximize points *over time*, and apples are the only source of points, cleaning is a necessary investment.
- The dirt is directly adjacent (one step south), so it's trivial to clean — no risk or delay.

Therefore, the optimal action is to clean the dirt at (7, 4). This ensures
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away. To reach it, I’d need to move through several tiles, potentially including more dirt. However, apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned to enable apple generation. Right now, there is dirt at (7, 4), and no apple is spawning because of it.
- Eating an apple now would give a +1.0 immediate reward, but since there are no apples currently spawning (due to dirt), the apple at (2, 5) is not accessible or viable — it's not even guaranteed to exist in the current state. In fact, the global scan implies that apple spawning is contingent on cleanliness.
- Cleaning dirt at (7, 4) is a necessary step to enable future apple spawning. Even though it gives no immediate reward, it directly improves the long-term viability of the environment for apple generation. This aligns with the goal of maximizing points over time by enabling more apples to spawn.

--- Step 21 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (9, 7). You see dirt at (8, 7).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (8, 7).

Here’s the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 4 units away — quite distant. Eating it would give +1.0 point, but it's not immediately accessible, and there’s no indication that apples are spawning now due to clean land.
- The dirt at (8, 7) is only 1 unit away — very close. Cleaning it is a low-cost, high-impact action for enabling future apple spawning.
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. So, by cleaning the dirt, I’m directly contributing to the condition that allows apples to appear in the future — which benefits the group and increases long-term apple availability.
- There is no immediate reward for cleaning, but the long-term payoff is significant: once the dirt is cleaned, apples may spawn in nearby areas (like (9,7) or (10,7)), potentially making future apple collection easier and more frequent.
- Since I’m at (9,7) and dirt is at (8,7), I can move left to (8,7) and clean it in one step. This is a simple, efficient action with clear strategic value
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 7}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (4, 1). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: Given the current situation, I must carefully analyze the trade-off between immediate reward and long-term benefit.

I am at position (4, 1). The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 units away — a significant distance. There is no visible apple nearby, and the nearest dirt is at (7, 0), 4 units away. This suggests that apples are not currently spawning because the river is not clean. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), **apples are not available for immediate consumption** — even if I were to move toward them, they won’t appear unless the dirt is cleaned first.

Therefore, **eating an apple is not possible right now**, because no apple is within reach or in spawning range due to the dirty river.

The second option — cleaning dirt — is critical. Removing dirt at (7, 0) will improve the river's cleanliness, which in turn enables apple spawning. This is a **necessary prerequisite** for future apple availability. Since apples are currently not spawning, cleaning the dirt is not just a good idea — it's a prerequisite for any long-term progress.

Additionally, the global scan shows no immediate apples nearby, and movement is restricted to
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 8). You see an apple at (1, 8).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 8).

Reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only one step away — a direct, low-effort action that gives +1.0 point immediately.
- The nearest dirt is at (8, 7), which is 7 units away. Cleaning it would require significant movement and time, and there is no immediate benefit from doing so — apples only spawn when the river is clean, but we don’t know if that condition has been met yet. Since apples are already present, the system is already allowing spawning.
- There’s no indication that the dirt cleaning is urgent or that future apple spawns are at risk. The presence of an apple suggests the environment is already in a state where spawning is possible.
- In a cleanup game, while long-term cooperation (like cleaning dirt) may benefit the group, individual rewards must be maximized first, especially when immediate, accessible rewards exist.
- Moving to clean dirt would delay my ability to earn points, and with no current apple spawn risk, it's not a necessary action.

Therefore, the optimal trade-off is to eat the apple now — it provides immediate reward with no risk, and the long-term cleanup action is not currently required. I will move to (1

--- Step 22 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 7). You see dirt at (8, 7).
  Thinking: I am at (8, 7), and I see dirt at that exact location. The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 5 units away — a considerable distance. There is no apple currently visible or reachable in the immediate vicinity, and the only dirt is right where I am standing.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There is no apple at (8, 7). I cannot eat an apple here. The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which requires moving 5 steps east. Since I'm not currently at an apple, eating one is not possible right now. So, this option is not viable.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   → Yes, this is critical. Dirt must be cleaned to allow apples to spawn. The current dirt at (8, 7) is blocking apple generation in that area. Cleaning it will remove the dirt and potentially allow apples to spawn in the future — especially since the nearest apple is at (13, 7), which lies on the same row (y=7). If the path from (8,7) to (13,7) is cleaned
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 7}} -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (5, 1). You see dirt at (7, 0).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am at position (5, 1). The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 7 units away — quite far. The nearest dirt is at (7, 0), which is only 3 units away. That means I can reach the dirt in a few moves, and cleaning it would allow apples to spawn in the future.

Currently, there are no apples visible in the immediate vicinity. The only apple on the map is far away, and there's no indication that it's spawning now — apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned). Since dirt is present, and apples require a clean river to spawn, cleaning the dirt is a necessary step to enable future apple generation.

Eating an apple now would give me +1.0 point, but there's no apple in my immediate vicinity — I would have to walk to (2, 5), which is a long distance and would take multiple steps. Given that the apple is 7 steps away, and I don't know if it's even available now (since it depends on river cleanliness), it's not a viable option at this moment.

Cleaning the dirt at (
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (1, 8). You see an apple at (1, 8).
  Thinking: I am at (1, 8), and there is an apple directly at my position — distance 0. This means I can immediately eat it and gain +1.0 point. 

Looking at the global scan: the nearest dirt is at (8, 7), which is 8 units away. That implies that cleaning dirt is not immediately accessible and would require a significant movement effort. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is reduced), cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple spawning — but it does not yield any immediate reward.

Right now, there is no apple elsewhere nearby, and no immediate dirt to clean. The apple at (1, 8) is both available and accessible. 

Trade-off analysis:
- Eating the apple now gives me an immediate +1.0 point — a clear, tangible reward.
- Cleaning dirt would require moving to (8, 7), which is 8 steps away, and would not yield any immediate benefit. Moreover, since apples only spawn *after* the river is clean, and we don’t have any apples elsewhere, the future benefit is uncertain and delayed.
- There is no urgent need to clean dirt because no apples are currently spawning — and the apple at (1
- Since I cannot eat the apple at (2,
  Decision: {'action': 'random_explore', 'args': {}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 5). You see an apple at (2, 5).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (2, 5).

Reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available at my current position (2, 5), with a distance of 0. This provides a direct +1.0 point reward with no risk or cost.
- There is no immediate benefit to cleaning dirt at (7, 3) — it’s 7 units away and far from the current location. Cleaning dirt is only beneficial in the long term when apples are not spawning, but since an apple is already present and accessible, there’s no need to delay action.
- The rules state that apples only spawn when the river is clean, meaning dirt removal enables future apple spawns. However, in this scenario, apples are already spawning (one is present), so the system is already functioning. Cleaning dirt would only be beneficial if no apples were available — which is not the case here.
- There is no mention of any danger, obstacle, or time constraint. The immediate action of eating the apple maximizes current points.
- Since I cannot move diagonally, and the apple is already at my current location, there is no need to move or explore.

Therefore, the optimal action is to eat the apple at (2, 5) for an immediate +1

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 1). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 2 at (3, 0).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Here's the reasoning:

- The apple at (1, 0) is within reach — only 2 steps away (up to (2,0), then left to (1,0)). This is a direct, immediate action that gives +1.0 point, which is valuable and achievable right now.
- The nearest dirt is at (8, 1), which is 6 steps away. Cleaning it would require significant movement and time, with no immediate reward. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, this is a long-term strategy that doesn't benefit us now.
- There is no immediate threat or urgent need to clean dirt — agent 2 is at (3,0), which is not in a position to interfere or block access to the apple. We don’t have any information suggesting agent 2 is a threat or that they’re trying to prevent apple collection.
- The trade-off between immediate reward and future potential is unfavorable here: the apple is close, accessible, and provides a clear, positive point. Delaying it for a distant dirt cleanup would waste valuable time and opportunity.
- In a cleanup game, while cleaning dirt is necessary for long-term apple spawning, it is not

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (3, 0). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 1 at (2, 1).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Here’s the reasoning:

- The apple at (1, 0) is only 2 steps away — a very short distance. Since apples give +1.0 points each and there's no immediate reward for cleaning dirt, the immediate benefit of eating the apple is clear and accessible.
- The nearest dirt is at (8, 1), which is 6 steps away — far beyond the current reach. Cleaning it would require significant effort with no immediate benefit, and since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is reduced), the future apple spawn is not guaranteed and not imminent.
- Agent 1 is at (2, 1), which is adjacent to the apple at (1, 0). This suggests that the apple might be in a contested or shared zone. However, there's no indication that agent 1 is blocking or guarding it — only that they are present. Eating the apple now gives me a point, and I can still move later to clean dirt if needed.
- There’s no immediate threat or necessity to clean dirt. The goal is to maximize points, and since apples spawn *only* when the river is clean, cleaning dirt is a long-term investment
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 1, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 5). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 3), even though it offers no immediate reward.

Here's the reasoning:

- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Right now, there is dirt at (7, 3), which is 7 units away. This dirt is blocking apple spawning — meaning apples are not currently available anywhere, even though one is at (1, 8). The presence of dirt prevents the apple from spawning at (1, 8), or any other location, because the river is not clean.
- The nearest apple is at (1, 8), but it's only visible because it's already there — it may not be sustainable. Without cleaning the dirt, future apple spawns will not occur, and the group will be unable to gain apples long-term.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0, but if the river remains dirty, no more apples will spawn — the game state becomes stagnant and unproductive.
- Cleaning dirt is a necessary prerequisite for future apple spawns. Even though it takes time and effort (7 steps), it enables long-term rewards.
- Since we're in a cleanup game where the goal is to maximize points through sustainable apple harvesting, immediate gains must be balanced against enabling future

--- Step 22 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (1, 1). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 2 at (2, 0).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available at distance 1, providing a direct +1.0 reward with no risk or cost.
- There is no visible dirt nearby that I can clean right now — the nearest dirt is at (8, 1), which is 7 units away. Cleaning it would require significant movement and time, and since apples only spawn *when the river is clean*, the benefit of future apples is speculative and delayed.
- Agent 2 is at (2, 0), which is adjacent to the apple. This suggests that agent 2 may also be able to access the apple, meaning the apple might be a shared opportunity. However, since I can act now and gain immediate points, and there's no indication that agent 2 will eat it before me, I have a first-mover advantage.
- The rule states that cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward — so there's no incentive to delay action for long-term benefits when immediate rewards are available.
- There is no evidence of dirt near me that would enable apple spawning in the near term. Thus, the "future apples" benefit is not actionable now.

Therefore, the optimal decision is to eat the apple at (1
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 1, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 0). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 1 at (1, 1).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only 1 step away — this is a direct, low-effort opportunity for a +1.0 reward.
- The nearest dirt is at (8, 1), which is 7 steps away — this is far off, and cleaning it would not provide any apples for a significant time. There is no immediate benefit to cleaning dirt at this stage.
- Agent 1 is at (1, 1), which is adjacent to the apple. If I don’t act now, that agent might eat the apple before me. Since apples are limited and spawn only when the river is clean, and we don’t have confirmation that cleaning dirt will produce apples in a timely manner, the immediate action is more valuable.
- There is no indication that the dirt at (8,1) is critical or that future apple spawns depend on it in the short term. Without a clear path or necessity to clean, the risk of delay outweighs the benefit of a delayed reward.
- Since I cannot move diagonally, the only viable path to the apple is via (2,0) → (1,0). That movement is simple and safe.

- If I eat an apple now, I get +1.0 immediately — but the apple may not be spawnable unless the river is clean. Since the river is currently dirty (dirt at (

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away — far from my current position at (7, 5). Eating it would require a long journey and would only provide +1.0 point immediately, with no guarantee of future apples.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 unit away — extremely close. Cleaning it will improve the river's cleanliness, which directly enables apple spawning on land. This is a prerequisite for future apple generation.
- There is no immediate apple nearby, and the current apple at (2, 5) is out of reach without a significant movement cost.
- The rule states that apples only spawn when the river is clean. Therefore, cleaning dirt is not just beneficial — it's necessary for apples to appear at all in the long run.
- Since I cannot move diagonally, the path to (7, 4) is straightforward (one step south), and cleaning it is efficient and low-cost.

Even though cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, it creates a foundation for future apple spawns, which could lead to higher cumulative points over time. This aligns with the group’s long-term goal

--- Step 21 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — far enough that immediate consumption would not be efficient, especially since apples only spawn *when the river is clean*. This means apples are not currently available due to dirt on the river.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 unit away — very close and directly reachable from my current position (7, 3). Cleaning it would be a minimal effort with high strategic value.
- Cleaning dirt does not give immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning. Since apples are the only source of points (+1.0 each), and they don’t spawn when dirt exists, cleaning this dirt is essential to unlock future apple access.
- Agent 2 is at (7, 2), directly above me — they may be acting independently. If they are also trying to eat apples, the group benefit from cleaning shared river dirt is amplified. Since we are in a cooperative cleanup game, enabling apple spawning for the group is a shared goal.
- There is no immediate apple nearby, so eating one now would be a waste of opportunity. The trade-off is between short-term reward and long
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to make the best decision as Agent 2.

Current position: (7, 2)  
Agent 1 is at (7, 3) — directly above me, so we're in close proximity.  
Nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — not immediately reachable.  
Nearest dirt is at (7, 4), just one step above me — distance 1 (not 2 as listed in the global scan; likely a typo). That makes it extremely close.

Key points:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning (which benefits the group).
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.
- I cannot move diagonally — so movement is restricted to cardinal directions.

Now, the trade-off:
1. **Eat an apple?**  
   The nearest apple is 5 units away — I’d need to walk to (12, 2), which is far. There's no apple nearby. The nearest apple is not in range for immediate access. So eating one now is not feasible — I can

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here’s the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away. To reach it, I’d need to move through several tiles, possibly encountering more dirt or obstacles. However, eating an apple now would give me +1.0 point immediately — a clear reward.
- But apples only spawn *when the river is clean*, meaning dirt must be removed to enable apple generation. The dirt at (7, 4) is very close — only 1 unit away — and is the nearest dirt in the entire map. This suggests it's a key obstacle preventing apple spawning in that area.
- Since apples are the only source of points and they require clean land to appear, cleaning this dirt is a strategic investment. It doesn’t give immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawns — potentially leading to more points in the long run.
- There is no immediate apple nearby that can be eaten without risk or delay. Moreover, the dirt at (7, 4) is directly adjacent, so cleaning it is a low-effort, high-impact action that supports the system's sustainability.
- If I eat an apple now, I’m missing the chance to remove

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision.

Current position: (7, 3)  
Agent 2 is at (7, 2) — directly above me, so they're close.  
There is dirt at (7, 4) — directly to my right, just one step away.  
Nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 steps away.  
The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 step from me — very close.  

Now, evaluating the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple currently visible at my position. The nearest apple is 6 steps away, and I don’t see any apples in my immediate vicinity. Eating an apple would require moving to where one is. Since no apple is available now, this option gives no immediate benefit and delays progress.

2. **Clean the dirt at (7,4)?**  
   This is a critical action. Dirt removal is necessary to enable apple spawning. The dirt is only one step away — very accessible. Cleaning it would allow apples to spawn on land in that area (or nearby), which could lead to future apple availability. Since apples spawn only when

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to make the best decision for maximizing points and contributing to the group's long-term success.

Current position: (7, 2)  
Agent 1 is at (7, 3) — directly above me, so we're in the same column.  
Nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — on the same row, so I can reach it via a straight path.  
Nearest dirt is at (7, 4), which is only 2 units away — directly above me.  

Key insight: Apples only spawn when the river is clean. Dirt cleaning is not rewarding immediately, but it enables future apple spawning. Since apples are the only source of points (+1.0 each), and we have a nearby apple (distance 5), I must weigh immediate gain against long-term sustainability.

Let’s break down the options:

1. **Eat an apple at (12, 2)**  
   - Immediate reward: +1.0  
   - But the apple is 5 steps away — I’d need to move to (12, 2), which is far.  
   - Meanwhile, cleaning dirt at (7, 4) is

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away — quite far. Eating it would give +1.0 point, but it's not immediately accessible or likely to be the only apple available.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 unit away — very close. Cleaning it is a small, low-effort action that directly improves the river's cleanliness.
- The rule states that apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. So, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple spawning. Without cleaning, no apples can appear — even if we're close to one now.
- There's no immediate reward from cleaning, but it enables future rewards. Since apples are the only source of points, and they don't spawn unless the river is clean, cleaning is a necessary investment.
- Moving diagonally is not allowed, so movement is constrained to cardinal directions. From (7,5), moving to (7,4) to clean is straightforward and efficient.

- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning — which

There is no apple currently visible or nearby, and the only dirt is at (6, 3) and (7, 3), both of which are adjacent to my current position.

Let’s evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There is no apple visible at my current location. The nearest apple is 6 steps away, and I have no information about whether it's spawnable now. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), and there’s currently dirt at (6, 3), the apple at (2, 1) is not currently accessible. Eating an apple is not possible now, so this option is invalid.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   → This is a strategic move. The dirt at (6, 3) and (7, 3) must be cleaned to allow apples to spawn in the future

  Obs: You are at (2, 7). You see nothing of interest nearby.

This means I can reach an apple immediately without any significant risk or cost. Eating an apple would give me +1.0 point immediately, which is a clear, tangible reward.

However, the nearest dirt is at (6, 3), which is 8 steps away — quite far. Cleaning dirt would enable future apple spawning, which benefits the group, but it would require a significant investment of movement and time with no immediate return. Given that apples only spawn when the river is clean, and that the current apple is already within reach, there is no immediate need to clean dirt *now* — especially since we are not told that the river is currently dirty or that apples are not spawning.

Moreover, the global scan indicates that apples are already available at (2, 5), which is adjacent to my current position. Since apples spawn *only when the river is clean*, and we don’t have any indication that the river is currently dirty or that cleaning is required for apple availability, the presence of an apple suggests the river is already clean — meaning no cleaning action is necessary *right

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 2). You see agent 2 at (6, 3) and dirt at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the current situation and make a strategic decision based on the rules and goals.

Current position: (6, 2)  
Agent 2 is at (6, 3) — directly above me, so we're in close proximity.  
There is dirt at (7, 3), which is immediately to my right.  
The nearest apple is at (2, 1), which is 5 steps away — quite far.  
The nearest dirt is at (7, 3), only 2 steps away (from (6,2) to (7,3)).

Key point: Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Cleaning dirt enables future apple spawning. However, eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately. Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward but is necessary for future apple generation.

Trade-off:
- Eating an apple now would give immediate +1.0, but that apple is far away (distance 5), and we don't have access to it yet.
- The dirt at (7,3) is only 1 step away — very close. Cleaning it would make land more fertile and enable future apple spawning.
- There is no apple nearby (within 1 or 2 steps),
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 3}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 3). You see agent 1 at (6, 2) and dirt at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 3).

Here's why:

- There are no apples currently visible nearby — the nearest apple is at (2, 1), which is 6 units away. Eating an apple now would give a +1.0 reward, but it would be a very distant and inefficient action given the current state.
- The dirt at (7, 3) is only 1 unit away — very close and directly accessible. Cleaning it is a small, immediate action that contributes to the long-term goal of enabling apple spawning.
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed). So, cleaning this dirt directly enables future apple spawning — possibly at (7, 3) or nearby land points — which could benefit the entire group.
- Since I am Agent 2 and the goal is to maximize points through collective success (apples spawning), the long-term value of enabling future apple growth outweighs the short-term gain of eating a distant apple.
- There's no immediate threat or urgent need to move toward the apple at (2, 1) — it's far away and requires a long path through potentially dirty or unproductive terrain.

Therefore, cleaning the dirt at (7
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 3}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 6). You see an apple at (2, 5).
  Thinking: Given the current situation, I should **eat the apple at (2, 5)**.

Here's the reasoning:

- The apple is directly adjacent (distance 1), so it's immediately accessible and provides a clear +1.0 reward with no risk or cost.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 3), which is 8 units away — far from the current position. Cleaning it would require significant movement and time, and since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), it's a long-term investment with no immediate payoff.
- There is no indication that cleaning dirt would yield any apples in the near term, and since we are already at a position with an apple within reach, acting on immediate available rewards is optimal under the goal of maximizing points.
- The rule says apples only spawn when the river is clean — this implies that cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple generation, not a standalone action. Therefore, unless we have a clear path to dirt and a guaranteed future apple spawn, it's not efficient to sacrifice immediate gains.

Thus, the trade-off favors immediate action: **eat the apple at (2, 5)**. This gives a direct point, and the group can later address dirt cleaning

--- Step 23 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see dirt at (7, 3) and agent 2 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 3).

Here's the reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible in immediate proximity (the nearest apple is at (12, 2), 5 units away), and I am at (7, 2). Eating an apple now would not be possible without first reaching it — which requires moving through or past the dirt at (7, 3).
- The dirt at (7, 3) is directly adjacent and blocking movement. Since I cannot move diagonally, I must go around it or clean it to proceed.
- Cleaning dirt is essential for apple spawning — the rule states apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. This means that if I leave the dirt uncleaned, no apples will appear in the area, and future apple spawns are blocked.
- Agent 2 is currently at (7, 3), which suggests they may be trying to clean or interact with it too. If I don’t act now, they might clean it, but I don’t know their intentions. If I wait, I risk missing an opportunity to contribute to a clean environment that enables future apple spawns.
- There is no immediate apple reward available now — I can’t eat one without moving to a spot
  Obs: You are at (2, 5). You see an apple at (2, 5).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (2, 5).

Reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available at my current position (2, 5), with a distance of 0. This means I can consume it instantly and gain +1.0 point — a direct, immediate reward with no risk or cost.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 3), which is 7 units away. Cleaning it would require movement and time, and there's no immediate benefit from doing so — apples only spawn when the river is clean, which is a long-term, conditional outcome. Since no apples are currently spawning (and we have one right now), cleaning dirt is not urgent.
- There's no indication that future apple spawns depend on immediate actions. The current apple is already present and accessible, so skipping it to clean dirt would be a waste of a valuable opportunity.
- The rules state that apples only spawn when the river is clean — but that doesn't mean they *must* spawn now or that we need to clean dirt before eating an existing apple. We are not required to clean dirt to eat apples; we only need clean conditions to *enable* future spawning.

Therefore, the optimal action is to eat the apple at (2, 5) for

--- Step 21 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 1). You see an apple at (1, 0).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Here's the reasoning:

- The apple is at (1, 0), which is only 2 steps away — a very short distance. This means I can reach it quickly and gain +1.0 point immediately.
- The nearest dirt is at (8, 2), which is 7 units away. Cleaning that dirt would require a significant amount of movement and time, and there’s no immediate benefit to doing so — apples only spawn *when the river is clean*, but we don’t know if the river is currently polluted or if cleaning will result in apples appearing soon. Without a clear timeline or guarantee that cleaning leads to apple spawning, this action is speculative and delayed.
- There is no immediate reward for cleaning dirt, and since we are already in a position where an apple is visible and reachable, acting on immediate, tangible opportunity is optimal.
- In a cleanup game, while long-term environmental health (like cleaning dirt) is important for future apple spawning, the goal is to *maximize points*. Since we are at a point where we can gain a point now with minimal effort, and future gains are uncertain and require significant effort, the immediate reward is more efficient.

Therefore, the best action
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 1, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see dirt at (8, 2) and dirt at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am at (7, 2).  
I see dirt at (8, 2) and (7, 3).  
The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away.  
The nearest dirt is at (8, 2), just 1 unit away — that means I can clean it immediately.  

Key points:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned to allow apples to appear.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately, which is a direct reward.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but enables future apple spawning — which benefits the group and long-term goals.

Right now, there is **no apple in immediate range** — the nearest is 5 steps away.  
However, cleaning dirt at (8,2) is only one step away.  

If I eat an apple now, I get +1.0, but there is **no apple visible or reachable** in the current state. I cannot eat an apple unless one is present and accessible. Since no apple is visible at (8,2) or (7,3), and the nearest is at (
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 2}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 5). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully.

Currently, I am at (2, 5). The nearest apple is at (1, 8), which is 4 units away — a reasonable distance, but not immediate. The nearest dirt is at (7, 3), 7 units away. 

Key point: Apples only spawn when the river is clean — that is, when dirt is removed. So, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple spawning. There is no immediate reward for cleaning dirt, but without it, apples won’t appear at all.

Right now, there are no visible apples nearby — the nearest is 4 steps away, and I don’t see anything of interest. If I eat the apple at (1,8), I get +1.0 point immediately. But if I don’t clean the dirt at (7,3), future apple spawns (which are necessary for long-term points) will not happen. Since apples are the only source of points, and they depend on cleaning dirt, I must consider whether I should prioritize cleaning dirt to enable future apple spawns — even if it means forgoing an immediate apple.

However, I must also consider the efficiency and feasibility. Moving to (7,3) to clean dirt is

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (1, 1). You see an apple at (1, 0).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Here's the reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available at distance 1 — that means I can reach it in one move. Since eating an apple gives a direct +1.0 reward, and there's no cost to eating it, this is a clear, immediate gain.
- The nearest dirt is at (8, 2), which is 8 units away. Cleaning it would require a significant amount of movement and time, and there's no guarantee that cleaning it will result in apples appearing soon — especially since the global scan only shows one apple currently, and no indication of when or how dirt cleaning triggers apple spawning.
- There is no other nearby apple or dirt to consider. The current apple is the only one visible, and it's within reach.
- The rule says apples only spawn when the river is clean — but that's a future condition. Right now, we are in a state where an apple is already present and accessible. Delaying action to clean dirt would mean missing a direct reward that could be used to improve my score immediately.
- Since I cannot move diagonally, the path to (8, 2) would require at least 7 moves in one direction (e.g., right
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 1, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 2). You see dirt at (8, 2) and dirt at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I am at (8, 2), which is currently covered in dirt. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), located 4 steps away — a manageable distance. However, apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, meaning dirt must be cleaned before apples can appear. Right now, there is dirt at (8, 2) and (7, 3), and since apples don’t spawn on dirt, we must first clean the dirt to enable apple growth.

Currently, I cannot eat an apple because I’m standing on dirt. Eating requires being on land. Therefore, **option 1 (eating an apple for immediate reward) is not possible** at this moment — it’s a misstep in reasoning.

Now, evaluating **option 2 (cleaning dirt to enable future apples)**: This is essential. Cleaning dirt removes the obstacle that prevents apple spawning. The dirt at (8, 2) is directly where I am. Cleaning it would allow land to form, which could eventually spawn an apple at (12, 2) or nearby. Since apples are the only source of points, and they don’t spawn on dirt, **cleaning is a necessary prerequisite** for any future apple harvest.

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here's the reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible in immediate proximity (the nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away), and I am at (7, 3). Eating an apple now would give +1.0, but there's no apple spawnable in the current state — apples only spawn *when the river is clean*, meaning dirt must be cleaned first.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 unit away — very close and directly adjacent. Cleaning it will make the river clean in that area, enabling apple spawning in the future.
- The apple at (12, 2) is far away, and to reach it, I would need to traverse a path that may currently be blocked by dirt. Without cleaning, no apples will spawn, so even if I move toward the apple, I won’t be able to eat it.
- The group benefit is critical: cleaning dirt enables future apple spawning, which increases the total points available to all agents. This is a long-term strategy that supports the collective goal.
- Since I cannot move diagonally, my movement is constrained to cardinal directions. From (7,
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision.

Currently, I am at (7, 2), and I see Agent 1 at (7, 3) — directly above me. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 steps away. That’s a significant distance. The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), just one step above me — distance 1 (since I’m at (7, 2), and (7, 4) is two steps up, so distance is 2). So, cleaning dirt at (7, 4) is very close and requires only 2 steps.

Now, let’s evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple immediately?**  
   The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 steps away. There’s no apple at my current position (7, 2). I cannot eat an apple without moving to it. So, there’s no immediate apple available to eat. This option is not viable.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   Dirt cleaning is essential — apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt). Cleaning dirt at (7,

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Reasoning:

- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. This means that dirt must be removed to enable apple spawning. Currently, there is dirt at (7, 4), which is just one step away — very accessible.
- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 steps away. That means I would need to travel through potentially dirty areas or across open land, but without first cleaning the dirt at (7, 4), there is no guarantee that apples will spawn in the future, even if I reach the apple.
- Eating an apple now would give me +1.0, but if I don’t clean the dirt, future apple spawns are blocked. Since apples are the only source of points, and they are dependent on clean land, I must prioritize enabling future rewards.
- Cleaning the dirt is a necessary precondition for apple spawning. It doesn't give immediate reward, but it enables the system to function — which is essential for long-term point accumulation.
- Since the dirt is only one step away and I am already at (7, 5), I can move to (7, 4) efficiently and clean it. This action will improve

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision.

Current position: (7, 3)  
Agent 2 is at (7, 2) — directly above me, so they're in close proximity.  
There is dirt at (7, 4) — directly to my right, just one step away.  
Nearest apple is at (12, 2), 6 steps away.  
The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 step away — very close.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple at my current location (7, 3). The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 steps away. Eating an apple requires being at an apple location. Since no apple is currently visible or accessible immediately, I cannot eat one right now. So this option is not viable.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   This is a key point. Dirt cleaning is not rewarding immediately, but it enables apples to spawn when the river is clean. Right now, there is dirt at (7, 4), which is just one step from me. Cleaning it

  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to make the best decision for maximizing points and contributing to the group's long-term success.

Current position: (7, 2)  
Agent 1 is at (7, 3) — directly above me, so we're in the same column.  
Nearest apple is at (12, 2), 5 units away — that's a reasonable distance, but not immediate.  
Nearest dirt is at (7, 4), only 2 units away — very close.  

Now, the key trade-off:

1. **Eating an apple for immediate reward**:  
   - Apples give +1.0 each, which is valuable.  
   - However, apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is removed).  
   - The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 steps away. If I eat it now, I get 1 point, but that apple may not be available in the future unless the river is clean.  
   - More importantly, if I don’t clean the dirt at (7,4), no new apples will spawn — meaning future apple spawns are blocked.  
   - Since apples only spawn when the river

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away. To reach it, I would need to move through several tiles, possibly including dirt or other obstacles. However, apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning that dirt must be removed to enable apple generation. Right now, there is dirt at (7, 4), which is just one step away from my current position (7, 5). This dirt is directly adjacent and thus a clear, immediate opportunity to clean.

- Eating an apple now would give me a +1.0 reward, but there are no apples visible nearby — the nearest one is 5 steps away. Even if I could reach it, there’s no guarantee it will spawn unless the environment is clean. Since apples spawn only when the river is clean, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple generation.

- Cleaning the dirt at (7, 4) doesn't give immediate points, but it enables future apple spawning — which benefits the group and increases the long-term potential for rewards. Since I'm an agent in a cooperative cleanup game, maximizing future apple availability is a key strategic goal.

- There is no

Current position: (7, 3)  
Agent 2 is at (7, 2) — directly above me.  
Dirt is at (7, 4) — directly to my right.

- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but enables future apple spawning.
- I can only move in cardinal directions (up, down, left, right) — no diagonals.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.

Immediate options:
1. Eat an apple → +1 point now, but apples only spawn when the river is clean. If I eat now, I'm not helping clean the river, and if the river remains dirty, future apples (including the one at (12,2)) may not spawn.

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation and make a strategic decision based on the game rules and current state.

Current position: (7, 3)  
Agent 2 is at (7, 2) — directly above me, so we're adjacent vertically.  
There is dirt at (7, 4) — directly to my right (east), distance 1.  
Nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — far but reachable.  
The key rule: apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is removed). So cleaning dirt enables apple spawning.

Let’s break down the options:

1. **Eat an apple immediately**  
   - Immediate +1.0 reward.  
   - But there is no apple in immediate range. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 steps away — not reachable in a single move.  
   - There is no apple visible at (7, 3) or nearby.  
   → So, no apple is available to eat now. This option is invalid.

2. **Clean the dirt at (7, 4)**  
   - Distance: 1 step (from (7,3

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the trade-off carefully given the current situation.

I am at (7, 2), and I see Agent 1 at (7, 3) — directly above me, so we are in close proximity. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — that's a significant distance. The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), just one step above me, at distance 2. 

Key facts:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned).
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but enables future apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.
- I cannot move diagonally — so movement is restricted to up/down/left/right.

**Option 1: Eat an apple?**  
There is no apple currently visible at my position. The nearest apple is 5 steps away, and I don't know if it will spawn soon. Since apples only spawn when dirt is cleaned, and the dirt is nearby (at (7,4)), I cannot eat an apple *now* — it’s not available. So this option is not viable.

**Option 2: Clean the dirt at (7,4
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4) and dirt at (7, 6).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away. That means it's not immediately accessible — I would need to move through multiple tiles to reach it. Eating it now would give me +1.0 point, but it's not a short-term or high-value opportunity given the distance.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 unit away from my current position (7, 5). This is the nearest dirt, and cleaning it would directly improve the river's cleanliness.
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. So, by cleaning dirt, I'm enabling future apple spawning — which benefits the group and increases the overall potential for rewards.
- There's no immediate apple available nearby. The apple at (2, 5) is far away, and there's no indication that it will spawn unless the river is clean. Since the river is currently dirty, no apples can spawn — regardless of where I am.
- Moving to clean dirt doesn't cost me anything in terms of points; it's a necessary precondition for future rewards. It's a long-term investment with no immediate payoff, but without

--- Step 24 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to determine the best course of action.

Currently, I am at (7, 3). Agent 2 is at (7, 2), directly above me. There is dirt at (7, 4), directly to my right. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — a significant distance. The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 unit away, meaning it's very close and accessible.

Key points:
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately, but apples only spawn *when the river is clean* — meaning cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple generation.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning, which benefits the group (and potentially me in the long run).
- I can't move diagonally, so movement is limited to cardinal directions.
- There's no apple nearby — the nearest is 6 units away — so eating one now would be a missed opportunity if I can't get to it soon.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 step away — very easy to reach and clean.

Now, the trade-off:
- Option 1: Eat an apple
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am at (7, 2), and I see Agent 1 at (7, 3) — directly above me. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away. That’s a significant distance. The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), which is only 2 units away — directly above me. Cleaning this dirt would be very efficient and would enable apples to spawn in the future, especially since apples only appear when the river is clean.

Right now, there are no apples visible in immediate proximity. The apple at (12, 2) is far away, and there's no indication that it will spawn unless the river is clean. Since apples spawn only when the river is clean, cleaning the dirt at (7, 4) is a necessary precondition for future apple spawning — and it's within reach.

Eating an apple now would give me +1.0 immediately, but since no apple is near, and the only apple is 5 steps away, the immediate benefit is minimal. Moreover, if I eat an apple now, I’m not making progress toward enabling future apple spawns — which is critical for the group
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4) and dirt at (7, 6).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here's the reasoning:

- There is no apple currently in immediate range (the nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away). Eating an apple now would not provide a meaningful immediate reward given the distance and lack of nearby apples.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is directly adjacent to my current position (7, 5), making it the closest and most accessible dirt patch. Cleaning it would improve the river’s cleanliness, which in turn increases the likelihood of apple spawning in the future — especially since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean.
- Cleaning dirt has no direct reward, but it is a necessary prerequisite for apple spawning. Since apples are the only source of points, and they only appear when the river is clean, this action is strategically vital for long-term success.
- Moving to clean the dirt is a low-risk, high-impact action. It doesn’t require leaving my current position or making a long journey, and it directly supports the group's ability to eventually harvest apples.

Therefore, I should clean the dirt at (7, 4) to enable future apple spawning. This aligns with the goal of maximizing points over time, even

2. **Clean the dirt at (7, 8)** — This is a high-value action. Dirt cleaning is not rewarding immediately, but it enables future apple spawning. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt), removing dirt at (7, 8)
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 8}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 0). You see dirt at (7, 0).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 0), and there is dirt at this location. The nearest apple is at (13, 0), 6 units away — which means I would need to move right along the x-axis to reach it. However, there are no apples currently spawning because the river is not clean (dirt exists). Apples only spawn when the river is clean, which means I must first clean the dirt at (7, 0) before apples can appear.

Let’s evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward**  
   → There is no apple at (7, 0). The nearest apple is 6 units away, and no apples are visible in the current state. Therefore, I cannot eat an apple immediately. This option is not viable.

2. **Clean the dirt at (7, 0)**  
   → This is necessary to enable apple spawning. Since apples only appear when the river is clean, cleaning this dirt will eventually allow apples to spawn at (13, 0) or elsewhere downstream. This action has no immediate reward, but it is a prerequisite for future apple access. Given that the nearest apple is 6 units away, and no apples are currently present, cleaning the dirt
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 8). You see agent 1 at (8, 7) and dirt at (7, 8).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 8), which is directly where the dirt is located. The global scan shows that the nearest apple is at (1, 8), which is 6 units away — a significant distance. There is no apple in immediate proximity, and the only dirt visible is at my current position.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple at (7, 8) — only dirt. So, I cannot eat an apple here. The nearest apple is at (1, 8), which requires moving left across the map. Since there's no apple spawn at (7, 8), eating one now is not possible. This option is invalid.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   This is critical. Dirt must be cleaned to allow apples to spawn. Currently, there is dirt at (7, 8), and the river is not clean — meaning apples cannot spawn here. By cleaning this dirt, I enable the possibility of apples appearing in the future, especially since the nearest apple is at (1, 8), which is far from here. Cleaning this dirt contributes to the group’s long-term goal of enabling apple spawning. Since

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 7). You see dirt at (8, 7) and agent 3 at (7, 8).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (8, 7).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 6 units away — quite far. Eating it would give +1.0 point, but it's not immediately accessible and requires a long path.
- The dirt at (8, 7) is only 1 unit away — very close. Cleaning it is a minimal action with no immediate reward, but it directly contributes to making the river cleaner, which increases the chance of apples spawning in the future.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean. So, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple generation. Without cleaning, even if apples exist, they won't appear.
- There's an agent (agent 3) at (7, 8), which is adjacent to me. While this might suggest cooperation or competition, there's no indication of conflict or shared goals — and no evidence that agent 3 is blocking or interfering.
- Since apples are not currently spawning (because the river is dirty), and the only way to enable them is by cleaning dirt, the strategic priority is to enable future rewards.
- Moving to clean the dirt at (8, 7) is a simple, low
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 7}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 0). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: The current observation shows that I am at (7, 0), and there is a nearby apple at (13, 0), which is only 6 units away — a short distance. However, the nearest dirt is at (8, 7), which is 8 units away. This means that while I can reach the apple relatively quickly, I must first consider whether cleaning dirt is necessary to enable future apple spawning.

Let’s analyze the trade-off:

1. **Eating an apple for immediate reward**:  
   - Apples give +1.0 each, which is a direct and immediate point gain.  
   - The apple at (13, 0) is reachable in 6 moves (moving right along the x-axis), and since I’m at (7, 0), I can reach it in 6 steps.  
   - There is no indication that the apple is blocked or inaccessible.  
   - Eating it now provides a clear, tangible reward with no risk.

2. **Cleaning dirt to enable future apple spawning**:  
   - Dirt cleaning has no immediate reward.  
   - However, it enables apples to spawn on land when the river is clean.  
   - The dirt at (8, 7) is
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 13, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 8). You see agent 1 at (7, 7) and dirt at (8, 7).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am at (7, 8). Agent 1 is at (7, 7), and there is dirt at (8, 7). The nearest apple is at (1, 8), which is 6 steps away — quite far. The nearest dirt is at (8, 7), just one step away (to the east). 

Let’s break down the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple visible nearby. The nearest apple is at (1,8), which requires moving left to (6,8), then up/down to reach it — a long journey. Eating an apple now would require a significant effort with no immediate benefit. Also, apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning cleaning dirt is a prerequisite. So, unless there’s an apple immediately available, eating one now would be inefficient and not aligned with the goal of enabling future apple spawning.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   The dirt at (8,7) is very close — just one step east from my current position (7,8). Cleaning it would take only one move and one action. This

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 7). You see dirt at (8, 7) and agent 3 at (8, 8).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (8, 7).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 5 units away — not immediately accessible, and there are no apples currently visible in the immediate vicinity.
- The dirt at (8, 7) is directly where I am, and cleaning it will improve the river's cleanliness, which is a prerequisite for apples to spawn. Without clean land, apples won’t appear — even if they’re nearby.
- Eating an apple now is not possible because there is no apple at (8, 7); the only apple is far away at (13, 7), and I would need to travel to reach it.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning. Since apples are essential for scoring, and we are in a situation where apples are not currently spawning due to dirt, this action is a necessary investment in long-term gains.
- Agent 3 is at (8, 8), which is adjacent to me — possibly a coordination point. If we clean the dirt together, we might create a shared clean zone, increasing the chance of apple spawns in that area.
- There is no immediate benefit to exploring further without first cleaning

--- Step 23 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 7). You see dirt at (6, 6).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the trade-off between immediate reward and long-term benefits.

Currently, I am at (8, 7). The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 5 units away — reachable via a straight path along row 7. However, there's dirt at (6, 6), which is only 3 units away (distance = √(2² + 1²) = √5 ≈ 2.24, so actually closer than 3). That dirt is at (6,6), which is adjacent to (6,7) and (7,6), so it's within reach.

The key insight: **apples only spawn on land when the river is clean**. This means that cleaning dirt is not just a standalone action — it enables future apple spawning. Since apples are currently not spawning (no visible apples nearby), the system is likely in a "pre-spawn" state. Cleaning dirt will eventually allow apples to appear, which is essential for long-term point accumulation.

Now, evaluating the options:

1. **Eat an apple immediately?**  
   - The nearest apple is at (13,7), 5 units away.  
   - There are no apples
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 6}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 1). You see dirt at (7, 0).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 0).

Reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 7 units away — far out of immediate reach. There are no apples visible in the immediate vicinity, and no apples are currently spawning because the river is not clean.
- The dirt at (7, 0) is only 2 units away from my current position (6, 1), making it very accessible.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple generation. Even though there's no immediate reward from cleaning, this action enables future apple spawning, which directly supports the group's goal of maximizing points.
- Eating an apple now would provide a +1.0 reward, but there are no apples available at this moment. Without cleaning dirt, no apples will spawn at all, regardless of how far I go.
- Since I cannot move diagonally, the path to (7, 0) is straightforward: move right to (7, 1), then down to (7, 0) — a simple two-step action.

Therefore, the optimal strategy is to clean the dirt at (7, 0) to enable future apple spawning. This
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (1, 8). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to determine the best course of action.

Currently, I am at (1, 8). The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 4 steps away — a manageable distance. However, apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Right now, the nearest dirt is at (6, 6), which is 7 steps away. This means that cleaning that dirt would be necessary to enable future apple spawning — a long-term benefit for the group.

But here’s the key trade-off:
- Eating an apple gives me +1.0 immediately — a direct reward.
- Cleaning dirt has no immediate reward, but enables future apple spawning — a long-term benefit for the group.

Since I am at (1, 8), and the apple at (2, 5) is only 4 steps away, I can reach it in a few moves. However, if I eat that apple now, I gain a point, but I don’t address the dirt issue — which is essential for future apple generation.

Moreover, if I don’t clean the dirt at (6, 6), apples will not spawn on land, and the group will eventually run out of food. So, while eating now

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 7). You see dirt at (6, 6).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 6).

Here’s the reasoning:

- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. This means that cleaning dirt is not just a passive action—it's a prerequisite for future apple spawning. Without cleaning dirt, no apples can appear, regardless of how far away they are.
- The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 6 steps away. However, there is currently dirt at (6, 6), just 2 steps away from my current position (7, 7). This is a very close, actionable dirt patch.
- Eating an apple now would give a +1.0 reward, but it would be a short-term gain with no long-term benefit—since apples won’t spawn unless the river is clean.
- Cleaning the dirt at (6,6) will improve the environment, enabling future apple spawns. Since the nearest apple is far away (6 steps), and there's no immediate apple nearby, the long-term benefit of enabling future apple generation outweighs the immediate reward.
- There is no indication that any other dirt or apple is nearby, so focusing on this one dirt patch is both efficient and strategic.
- Movement is restricted to cardinal directions (no diagonals
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 6}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 1). You see dirt at (6, 0) and dirt at (7, 0).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 1). The current observation shows dirt at (6, 0) and (7, 0). The nearest dirt is at (7, 0), which is only 1 step away — very close. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 steps away, meaning it's not immediately accessible.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple visible in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), requiring a path through potentially dirty areas. Eating an apple now would require moving to that location, which is far and would likely require first cleaning dirt along the way. Since no apple is present at (7,1) or nearby, there's no immediate apple to eat. So, this option is not viable.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   This is critical. Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be removed. Dirt at (6,0) and (7,0) are directly adjacent to the current position. Cleaning (7,0) is just one step away. Cleaning dirt is not rewarding in itself, but
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 8). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to determine the best course of action.

Current position: (2, 8)  
Nearest apple: (2, 5) — distance = 3 steps (directly downward)  
Nearest dirt: (6, 6) — distance = 6 steps (requires moving right and down)  

The key trade-off is between:
- Immediate reward: eating an apple at (2,5) gives +1.0 point immediately.
- Long-term benefit: cleaning dirt at (6,6) enables future apple spawning (which benefits the group and may lead to more apples over time).

But here’s the critical point: **Apples only spawn when the river is clean**. That means dirt must be cleaned to allow apples to appear. However, right now, there is an apple *already* at (2,5), and it's within reach — just 3 steps away.

Since I can move only in cardinal directions (up, down, left, right), and no diagonal movement is allowed, I can reach the apple in 3 moves. That is a very short path.

Now, cleaning dirt at (6,6) is 6 steps away — much farther, and it would only enable

--- Step 25 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 7). You see dirt at (6, 6).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 6).

Here's the reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible in immediate proximity. The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 steps away — far out of reach for immediate consumption.
- The dirt at (6, 6) is only 1 step away — extremely close and directly accessible.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed). So, cleaning this dirt is not just a passive action — it's a necessary step to enable future apple spawning. Without cleaning, no apples will appear in the area, and the group will not gain any apple rewards.
- Eating an apple now is not feasible because no apple is within reach. Even if one existed nearby, it would be a waste of time and movement if we don’t first enable spawning.
- The goal is to maximize points *over time*, not just in the short term. Cleaning dirt enables future apple spawns, which directly increases long-term rewards.

Therefore, the optimal
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 1, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (3, 5). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: Given the current situation, let's analyze the trade-off carefully.

You are at (3, 5). The nearest apple is at (1, 8), which is 5 units away — a moderate distance, but not too far. However, apples only spawn when the river is clean, meaning that **apples do not appear unless dirt is cleaned**. Right now, the nearest dirt is at (7, 3), which is 6 units away — a similar distance to the apple. 

Key insight: **Apples don't spawn on their own**. They only appear when the river is clean. So, if there is no dirt cleaned, no apples will appear — even if you're close to one. Therefore, **eating an apple now would be impossible**, because the apple at (1, 8) will not spawn unless the dirt is cleaned first.

That means:
- **Option 1 (eat an apple)**: Not feasible. No apple can be eaten unless the river is clean. So this option is invalid.
- **Option 2 (clean dirt to enable future apples)**: This is essential. Cleaning dirt is the prerequisite for apples to spawn. Since the nearest dirt is at (7, 3), moving toward it

--- Step 23 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (1, 1). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 2 at (2, 0).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only 1 step away — this gives me a direct +1.0 reward with no risk or delay.
- The nearest dirt is at (8, 1), which is 7 steps away — cleaning it would require significant movement and time, and there is no immediate benefit from doing so.
- There is no indication that apple spawning depends on dirt being cleaned in a way that would be triggered by proximity or urgency. The rule states apples only spawn when the river is clean (less dirt), but this is a long-term, systemic effect — not something that provides immediate benefit or is worth sacrificing a direct, available reward for.
- Agent 2 is at (2, 0), which is adjacent to the apple. If agent 2 is also trying to eat it, there could be a conflict. However, since no rule specifies that agents can't share or that there's a priority system, and since I can reach the apple before agent 2, I should act first.
- Eating the apple now maximizes my immediate points and gives me a tangible reward with minimal effort.

There is no trade-off that justifies delaying this action. Cleaning dirt is

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 0). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 1 at (1, 1).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Here's the reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only 1 step away — this is a direct, actionable opportunity for a +1.0 reward with no risk.
- The nearest dirt is at (8, 1), which is 7 steps away. Cleaning it would require a significant time and movement investment, and there is no immediate benefit from doing so — especially since apples only spawn *when the river is clean*, meaning the dirt must be cleaned *before* apples appear. Since we already have an apple in range, there is no need to delay action for future spawns.
- There is no indication that the dirt at (8,1) is currently affecting the apple spawn rate or that the river is dirty in a way that would prevent spawning. The global scan shows only that dirt exists far away — no current issue.
- Agent 1 is at (1,1), which is adjacent to the apple at (1,0). This suggests that agent 1 might also be able to reach the apple, so there is a potential for competition. However, since the apple is at (1,0), and we are at (2,0), we have a direct path to it

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (4, 5). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: Given the current situation, let's analyze the trade-off carefully.

You are at (4, 5). The nearest apple is at (1, 8), which is 6 units away — a significant distance. The nearest dirt is at (7, 3), 5 units away. 

Key facts:
- Apples only spawn **when the river is clean**, meaning cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apple generation.
- Eating an apple gives **+1.0 point immediately**.
- Cleaning dirt gives **no immediate reward**, but enables future apple spawning — which benefits the group and supports long-term goals.

However, **you see nothing of interest nearby**. This suggests that no apple or dirt is in immediate visual range. The nearest apple is far away, and the nearest dirt is also not close.

So, evaluating the options:

1. **Eat an apple?**  
   → There is no apple visible at (4, 5). You cannot eat an apple unless it's present. Since no apple is in sight and the nearest is at (1, 8), you cannot immediately eat one. Therefore, this option is **not feasible**.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   → The dirt at (

--- Step 24 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (1, 1). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 2 at (2, 0).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available at distance 1 — a direct, positive reward of +1.0 point with no risk or cost.
- There is no visible immediate benefit to cleaning dirt at (8, 1), which is 7 units away. Cleaning dirt is a long-term investment that enables future apple spawning, but there is no current apple spawn or group coordination signal indicating that future apples depend on this action.
- Agent 2 is at (2, 0), adjacent to the apple. If I don’t act now, I risk missing the apple while agent 2 might also eat it (though the rules don’t specify if multiple agents can eat the same apple or if apples are one-time). Since apples are likely single-use (implied by the reward structure), acting now maximizes my immediate gain.
- There is no indication that the river is currently dirty or that cleaning is required for apple spawning — the global scan says apples only spawn when the river is clean, but currently, an apple *is* present, suggesting the river is already clean enough. Therefore, the need for cleaning is not urgent.

Thus, the optimal action is to eat the apple at (1,
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 1, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 0). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 1 at (1, 1).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only 1 step away — this is a direct, positive action with a clear +1.0 reward. There is no risk or cost to eating it.
- The nearest dirt is at (8, 1), which is 7 steps away. Cleaning it would require significant movement and time, and there is no immediate benefit to doing so. Moreover, since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and we currently have an apple already present, the future spawning of apples is not currently at risk — the system is already producing apples.
- Agent 1 is at (1, 1), which is adjacent to the apple at (1, 0). If Agent 1 is also trying to eat the apple, there could be a conflict. However, since I am at (2, 0), I can move to (1, 0) in one step, and agent 1 is at (1,1), meaning they would need to move down to reach it. Given the proximity, it's likely that either agent will claim the apple — but since I can reach it faster and it's not blocked, I have a first-mover
  Obs: You are at (3, 5). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: Given the current situation, I need to carefully analyze the trade-off between immediate reward and long-term benefit.

Currently, I am at (3, 5). The nearest apple is at (1, 8), which is 5 units away — a moderate distance. The nearest dirt is at (7, 3), 6 units away. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt provides no immediate reward, the decision hinges on whether the future benefit of enabling apple spawning outweighs the immediate reward of eating an apple.

However, there is a critical observation: **there are no apples visible nearby**, and the nearest apple is quite far away. Eating an apple now would give +1.0 point, but since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and no apples are currently spawning, it's likely that the apple at (1, 8) will not appear unless the river is cleaned first. Therefore, eating an apple now would be **a wasted action** — it would not contribute to enabling future apple spawns.

Moreover, cleaning dirt is necessary to enable future apple spawning. The dirt at (7, 3) is 6 units away — reachable, but requires movement. Since I currently

--- Step 23 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (1, 0). You see an apple at (1, 0).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available at my current position (1, 0), with a distance of 0. This gives me a direct +1.0 reward with no risk or cost.
- There is no immediate benefit to cleaning dirt at (7, 3), which is 9 units away — that action would take time and movement without any immediate payoff.
- The global scan shows no nearby dirt, and the nearest dirt is far away. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple spawns, but it is not currently necessary because apples are already present.
- In a cleanup game where immediate rewards are available and future rewards depend on long-term actions, prioritizing immediate gains (like eating an apple) aligns with maximizing points in the current state.
- There is no indication that the apple at (1, 0) is temporary or will disappear — so it is safe to consume.

Therefore, eating the apple now maximizes immediate points and provides a clear, safe action. Cleaning dirt should be deferred until future states where apples are not spawning or when the group has a strategic need for a cleaner river.

Final decision: Eat the apple at
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 1, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'eat'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 2). You see dirt at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to determine the best course of action.

Current position: (8, 2)  
Visible dirt: (7, 3) — distance = 1 step (directly north-west)  
Nearest apple: (12, 2) — distance = 4 steps (to the east)  
Global scan shows the dirt at (7,3) is the nearest dirt, and cleaning it would help enable apple spawning in the future.

Key considerations:

1. **Immediate reward vs. long-term benefit**:
   - Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately — a clear and direct reward.
   - However, apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed). Right now, there is dirt at (7,3), which is very close. If I don't clean it, apples may not spawn at all, or spawn later when the river is dirtier — reducing future opportunities.
   - Since the nearest apple is 4 steps away and the dirt is only 1 step away, cleaning the dirt is both feasible and strategically important.

2. **Is there a trade-off?**:
   - I could eat an apple now, but that would be a short-term gain
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 3}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (4, 5). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 3) to enable future apple spawning.

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (1, 8), which is 6 units away — far beyond immediate reach and likely not worth eating now, especially since there's no visible apple nearby and the observation says "you see nothing of interest."
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 3), only 5 units away — a manageable distance to reach.
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed). This means cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple generation, which directly supports the group's goal of maximizing points.
- Eating an apple now gives +1.0, but that reward is temporary and doesn't contribute to long-term sustainability. Without cleaning dirt, future apple spawns won't occur, which would limit the group's ability to earn points over time.
- There's no immediate benefit to eating an apple when none are visible, and the global scan shows that the nearest apple is far away and not accessible without first cleaning the river.
- Cleaning dirt is a necessary investment with no immediate reward, but it enables future rewards. In a cleanup game where long-term success depends on environmental conditions,

--- Step 24 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (1, 0). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully.

Currently, I'm at (1, 0). The nearest apple is at (1, 8), which is 8 units away — directly upward along the same column. The nearest dirt is at (8, 0), which is 7 units away to the right.

Key observations:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned). So, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apples to appear.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately, but apples only exist when the river is clean.
- Right now, there are no apples visible, and the nearest dirt is at (8, 0) — 7 units away.
- The apple at (1, 8) cannot spawn unless the river is clean. Since we currently have dirt present, no apples are available.

Therefore:
- **I cannot eat an apple right now**, because no apples are spawning due to uncleaned dirt.
- **Cleaning dirt is necessary** to enable future apple spawning. Without cleaning dirt, apples won’t appear, and I will be stuck in a state where I can't gain points.
- The dirt at (8, 0) is only 7 units away
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see dirt at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 3).

Reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — a significant distance. There are no nearby apples (within 1-2 units) that I can reach immediately. Eating an apple now would give +1.0 point, but since no apple is in immediate range, this would be a missed opportunity for future rewards.
- The dirt at (7, 3) is only 1 unit away — very close. Cleaning it is a low-effort, high-impact action that improves the river's cleanliness, which directly increases the chance of apples spawning in the future. This is a foundational step for long-term success.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean. Without cleaning dirt, no apples will appear — even if I move toward the nearest apple, it won’t spawn. Thus, cleaning is a prerequisite for apple availability.
- There is no immediate alternative action that offers both reward and progress. Moving toward the apple without cleaning dirt is futile — the apple won’t spawn, and I’ll waste time and energy.
- The group benefit (future apple spawns) outweighs the immediate +1.0 point from eating an apple, especially
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 3}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 1 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 3), and I see agent 1 at (7, 2). There is dirt at (7, 3), which means the river is currently dirty and apples are not spawning. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 steps away. The dirt at (7, 3) is the nearest dirt, so cleaning it would be the first step to enable apple spawning.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple** — There is no apple at (7, 3), and the nearest apple is 6 steps away. Eating an apple would require movement to reach it, and since no apple is currently visible or reachable immediately, this would be a non-actionable option at this moment. Moreover, apples only spawn when the river is clean — so without cleaning dirt, apples won’t appear. Therefore, eating an apple now is not possible.

2. **Clean the dirt at (7, 3)** — This is a necessary action. Cleaning dirt improves the river's cleanliness, which enables apples to spawn in the future. Since apples are currently not spawning (due to dirt), cleaning is the only way to enable future apple availability. This action has no immediate reward,
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 3}} -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 5). You see an apple at (2, 5).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (2, 5).

Reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available at my current position (2, 5), with a distance of 0. This gives me a direct, immediate reward of +1.0 point — a clear and accessible gain with no risk or cost.
- There is no dirt nearby to clean (the nearest dirt is at (7, 3), which is 7 units away), so cleaning is not feasible or urgent. The rule states that apples only spawn when the river is clean, but since no dirt is currently near, there is no immediate need to clean to enable apple spawning.
- There is no indication that future apple spawns are dependent on my current actions — the global scan shows the nearest apple is already present and reachable.
- Since I cannot move diagonally, and no immediate threat or opportunity exists elsewhere, the optimal action is to maximize immediate reward while preserving future options.

Therefore, eating the apple is the most rational and beneficial choice given the current state. It provides immediate value, and since there's no dirt nearby to clean, no future apple spawning is at risk or blocked. The group may benefit later from cleaning, but that is not currently actionable or necessary.

--- Step 24 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see dirt at (7, 1) and agent 2 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 1).

Here’s the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — quite far. Eating it now would give only +1.0 point, but it’s not immediately actionable due to distance and lack of nearby apple availability.
- The dirt at (7, 1) is only 1 unit away — very close. Cleaning it is a low-effort, high-impact action that directly contributes to making the river cleaner, which increases the chance of apples spawning in the future.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean. So, cleaning dirt is not a reward in itself, but it is a necessary prerequisite for future apple generation. This supports the group’s long-term goal of maximizing apple harvests.
- Agent 2 is at (7, 3), which is just one step away from the dirt at (7, 1) — suggesting they may also be aware of or interested in cleaning. However, since the dirt is adjacent and only one step away, I can act immediately to clean it and contribute to the shared goal.
- There is no nearby apple to eat immediately, and moving to the apple at (12,
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 1 at (7, 2) and dirt at (8, 4).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to determine the best course of action.

Current position: (7, 3)  
Agent 1 is at (7, 2) — directly above me, so they're in close proximity.  
Dirt is at (8, 4) — not immediately adjacent, but reachable.  
Nearest dirt globally is at (7, 1), which is just one step up from me.  
Nearest apple is at (12, 2), 6 steps away — far off, so immediate apple consumption isn't feasible.

Let’s evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple?**  
   There’s no apple visible in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which requires moving 6 steps — a significant distance. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is removed), and we currently have dirt at (7, 1) and (8, 4), apples are not currently spawning. Therefore, eating an apple is not possible right now. So, **no immediate apple reward is available**.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   This is critical. Dirt removal is necessary to allow apples
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 5). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: Given the current situation, let's analyze the trade-off carefully.

You are at (2, 5). The nearest apple is at (2, 1), which is 4 units away — directly upward along the same column. That means you can reach it in a straightforward vertical path (no diagonal movement required). Eating that apple would give you +1.0 point immediately.

However, the nearest dirt is at (8, 4), which is 7 units away. Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apples to spawn — meaning, without cleaning dirt, apples won’t appear at all, or will be rare. But cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward; it's a long-term investment in future apple availability.

Now, the key question: **Is there a balance between immediate reward and future benefit?**

- Immediate reward: Eating the apple at (2, 1) gives +1.0 point right now. This is a guaranteed, tangible gain.
- Future benefit: Cleaning dirt at (8, 4) would allow more apples to spawn later — but it requires moving 7 steps, and there's no guarantee that apples will appear immediately after cleaning, nor is there any indication that apples are currently missing due to dirt.

Moreover, the global scan shows

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 1). You see dirt at (7, 1) and agent 2 at (7, 2).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 1).

Here's the reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible in my immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (2, 1), which is 5 steps away — far beyond immediate reach.
- The dirt at (7, 1) is directly where I am, and cleaning it will contribute to making the river cleaner, which increases the chance of apples spawning in the future.
- Eating an apple now is not possible because there are no apples at my current position. The apple at (2, 1) is too far away and requires a path through potentially dirty or uncleaned terrain.
- The rule states that apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning dirt removal is a prerequisite for apple generation. Without cleaning dirt, apples won’t appear, even if they are nearby.
- Since I am already at the dirt location, cleaning it is both efficient and necessary. It doesn't cost anything in terms of movement or time and directly enables future apple spawns.
Therefore, cleaning the dirt at (7,4) is the optimal first action. It doesn't give immediate points, but it ensures that apples can spawn in

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — quite far. There are no apples visible in immediate proximity (like at (7, 3) or nearby), and the only dirt is at (7, 4), just one step away.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 point, but there are no apples visible nearby. The apple at (12, 2) is not accessible without first cleaning the dirt that blocks the path or prevents apple spawning.
- The rule states: *Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (less dirt = more apples)*. This means dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning. If we don’t clean the dirt at (7, 4), no apples will appear in that region — and since the nearest apple is far away, we may never get to it.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only one step away — it's very close and directly adjacent to my current position at (7, 3). I can move to (7, 4) and clean it in one action.
- Cleaning this dirt will improve
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the trade-off carefully given the current situation.

I am at (7, 2), and I see Agent 1 at (7, 3) — directly above me. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away. The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), just one step above me — a distance of only 2 units. This dirt is very close and directly accessible.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward**:  
   The apple at (12, 2) is 5 steps away. To reach it, I’d have to move right to (8,2), then (9,2), (10,2), (11,2), (12,2). That’s a long path. More importantly, apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning, dirt must be cleaned. Right now, there's dirt at (7,4), and without cleaning it, no apples will spawn. So, even if I go to (12,2), I won’t get an apple unless the river is clean. Therefore, **eating an apple now is not possible** — because the apple

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4) and dirt at (7, 6).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here's why:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away — a significant distance. Eating it would give +1.0 point immediately, but it's not close or guaranteed to be available in the long term.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 unit away — very close — and cleaning it is a minimal effort (one move) with high strategic value.
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Since dirt is blocking apple spawning, removing it enables future apple generation. This directly supports the group's long-term goal.
- There is no immediate benefit to eating an apple here — it's far away and not in immediate reach. The immediate reward is low and not worth the opportunity cost of not cleaning dirt that could enable future apple spawns.
- Cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apple spawning, so skipping it would mean future apple availability is limited or blocked.

Even though there's no immediate reward, the long-term benefit of enabling apple spawning outweighs the short-term gain of eating a distant apple.

Therefore, the optimal action is to clean the dirt at (7, 4). This sets the foundation for future

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here's my reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — quite far. Eating it would give a +1.0 reward, but it's not immediately accessible or likely to spawn without first cleaning dirt.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 unit away — extremely close. Cleaning it is a low-effort, high-impact action that directly improves the environment for future apple spawning.
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Since dirt is currently blocking apple generation, cleaning it enables future apple growth. This is a necessary prerequisite for long-term rewards.
- There is no immediate benefit to eating an apple now — it's far away and not guaranteed to be available in the current state. Moreover, eating an apple now would not help the group’s overall goal of creating a clean river and enabling apple spawning.
- Since I cannot move diagonally, I can only move up, down, left, or right. From (7, 3), I can move to (7, 4) to clean the dirt in one step — a simple, efficient action.

Therefore, cleaning the dirt at (
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to determine the best course of action.

Current position: (7, 2)  
Agent 1 is at (7, 3) — directly above me, so we're in close proximity.  
Nearest apple is at (12, 2), 5 units away — that's on the same row, so moving right would reach it.  
Nearest dirt is at (7, 4), just one step above me — distance 2.  

Key facts:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is removed).
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward but enables future apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.
- I cannot move diagonally — so movement is strictly horizontal or vertical.

Now, the trade-off:

Option 1: Eat an apple immediately  
- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 steps away.  
- I can’t eat an apple unless I reach it.  
- There is no apple visible at my current location (7,2).  
- So, I cannot eat an apple right now.  
→ This option is not viable.

Option 2: Clean the dirt at
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4) and dirt at (7, 6).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4) to enable future apple spawning.

Here’s the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away. To reach it, I’d need to move through multiple tiles — currently, I’m at (7, 5), and the only immediate dirt is at (7, 4) and (7, 6). Eating an apple now would give +1.0, but there are no apples visible nearby — the nearest is far away. So, immediate apple consumption offers little practical benefit in this moment.

- Cleaning dirt is not rewarding in itself, but it's essential for enabling apple spawning. The global scan shows that the nearest dirt is at (7, 4), just one step away. By cleaning it, I’m directly contributing to the system’s ability to spawn apples in the future — which benefits the group and increases long-term rewards.

- The rule states that apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt). Since dirt is currently blocking apple generation, removing it is a necessary prerequisite for future apple availability. This action, though not immediate, sets the stage for more apples to appear later, which could be harvested efficiently

2. Clean the dirt at (7,4) → takes 1 step (move to (7
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision for maximizing points and contributing to the group's long-term success.

**Current Position**: (7, 2)  
**Agent 1 Position**: (7, 3) — directly above me, so we're in the same column.  
**Nearest Apple**: (12, 2) — 5 steps away, on the same row.  
**Nearest Dirt**: (7, 4) — only 2 steps away, directly above me.  

Now, evaluating the options:

1. **Eat an apple at (12, 2)**?  
   - Immediate reward: +1.0 point.  
   - But the apple is 5 steps away — a long distance.  
   - The river is currently dirty (dirt exists), so apples may not spawn at all unless the dirt is cleaned.  
   - Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), and there's dirt at (7,4), we *must* clean it to enable apples to appear.  
   - If we don’t clean the dirt, apples will not spawn — even if we walk to (12,2), there
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4) and dirt at (7, 6).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to make the best decision as Agent 3.

Current position: (7, 5)  
Dirt at: (7, 4) and (7, 6)  
Nearest apple: (2, 5), distance = 5  
Nearest dirt: (7, 4), distance = 1  

Let’s break down the options:

1. **Eat an apple at (2, 5)?**  
   - Distance is 5 — that’s quite far.  
   - To reach it, I’d need to move through potentially dirty areas.  
   - There’s no apple currently visible nearby (only at (2,5)), and no indication that apples are spawning near me.  
   - Eating an apple now gives +1.0 point, but it’s a long journey and may not be worth it if I can't reach it efficiently.  
   - Also, apples only spawn when the river is clean — currently, there's dirt at (7,4) and (7,6), so the river is not clean.  
   - Therefore, no apple can spawn *now*, and the apple at (2,5) might not be accessible unless the environment is cleaned

--- Step 24 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the current situation and make a strategic decision based on the rules and goals.

Current position: (7, 3)  
Agent 2 is at (7, 2) — directly above me.  
There is dirt at (7, 4) — directly to my right.  
The nearest apple is at (12, 2), 6 steps away.  
The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), just 1 step away.

Let’s evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward**  
   - Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned).  
   - There is currently no apple visible in the immediate vicinity.  
   - The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 steps away — far from any dirt.  
   - Without cleaning dirt first, apples won’t spawn at all.  
   → Eating an apple is not possible right now because no apple is available (apples only spawn when dirt is cleaned).  
   → So, this option is invalid.

2. **Clean the dirt at (7, 4)**  
   - This is the only dirt visible and is only 1 step
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am at (7, 2), and I see Agent 1 at (7, 3) — directly above me. That means we are aligned vertically, and we're both on the same column. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — that's quite far. The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), which is only 2 units away — very close.

Now, consider the rules:
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed).
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward but enables future apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.
- I cannot move diagonally — so movement is only up, down, left, right.

Important trade-off:
- If I eat an apple now, I get +1.0 point immediately, but I'm not near any apples — the nearest is 5 steps away. So I can't eat one now.
- There are no apples visible or accessible in my immediate vicinity. I am at (7,2), and the nearest apple is at (12,2), which is 5
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4) and dirt at (7, 6).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Reasoning:

- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Right now, there is dirt at (7, 4) and (7, 6), which blocks apple spawning. Even though the nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away, it is currently unreachable because the terrain is blocked by dirt.
- Eating an apple now would give a +1.0 reward, but if the dirt remains, no apples will spawn in the future — meaning long-term rewards are lost.
- Cleaning dirt (e.g., at (7, 4)) takes no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning. Since apples are the primary source of points and the only reward mechanism, enabling their spawning is essential for long-term success.
- There is no nearby apple that can be eaten immediately due to dirt blocking access. The apple at (2, 5) is far away and requires a clean path — which starts with removing dirt.
- Moving to (7, 4) to clean it is only one step away (distance 1), making it an efficient and low-risk action.
- Cleaning dirt improves the overall environment for the group, supporting future apple

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here’s the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — quite far. Eating it would give +1.0 immediately, but it’s not close enough to be a practical short-term gain.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 unit away — very close. Cleaning it is a small effort (one move) and directly contributes to making the river clean, which increases the chance of apples spawning in the future.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean. So, cleaning dirt is not just a maintenance action — it enables future apple generation, which benefits the group and increases long-term rewards.
- There’s no immediate apple nearby (the nearest is far away), so eating one now gives no strategic advantage.
- Since I cannot move diagonally, moving to (7, 4) to clean it is straightforward and efficient.
- The trade-off between immediate reward and long-term benefit favors the latter. A single apple is a small reward compared to enabling a cleaner environment where more apples can spawn later.

Therefore, cleaning the dirt at (7, 4) is the optimal action — it advances the group’s
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am at (7, 2), and I see Agent 1 at (7, 3) — directly above me. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away. That means I would need to move right to reach it, likely passing through (8,2), (9,2), (10,2), (11,2), and then (12,2). That's a 5-step path — not immediate, but feasible.

The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), which is only 2 units away — directly above me. That means I can clean it in just two moves: up to (7, 3), then to (7, 4). Cleaning dirt doesn't give immediate points, but it's essential for future apple spawning. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt), cleaning dirt enables future apple generation — which benefits the entire group.

Now, the trade-off:
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately, but only if an apple is available and accessible.
- Cleaning dirt has no immediate reward but enables future apples.
  Obs: You are at (8, 0). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 2), even though there's no immediate reward.

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 5 units away. To reach it, I'd need to move through the terrain, likely passing through or near the dirt at (6, 2). 
- The dirt at (6, 2) is only 4 units away — a short path from my current position (8, 0). This means cleaning it is both feasible and efficient.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt removal is a prerequisite for apple spawning. If I don't clean this dirt, apples will not appear in that area, and the group will miss out on future rewards.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0, but that apple may not be available in the long term if the river remains dirty. Moreover, the apple at (13, 0) may not spawn at all unless the river is clean.
- Since the dirt is nearby and cleaning it enables future apple spawns, it's a strategic investment in long-term rewards rather than a short-term gain.
- There's no indication of other dirt or apple locations that are closer
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 2}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 8). You see dirt at (8, 7) and agent 1 at (8, 7).
  Thinking: I am at (8, 8), and I observe dirt at (8, 7) — directly south of me — with Agent 1 also present there. The nearest apple is at (13, 8), 5 units away. There is no apple currently visible near me, and the dirt at (8, 7) is the nearest dirt patch, only 1 unit away.

Let’s analyze the trade-offs:

1. **Should I eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There is no apple within reach. The nearest apple is 5 steps away, and I currently see no apple at (8, 8) or nearby. Eating an apple would require movement and would not be possible without first reaching it. So, *no immediate apple is available to eat*. Therefore, this option is not viable now.

2. **Should I clean the dirt at (8, 7) to enable future apple spawning?**  
   → This is a critical decision. Dirt removal is necessary for apples to spawn. Since apples only appear when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt), cleaning dirt enables future apple generation.  
   → The dirt is *right next to me*, only 1 step away. This is

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 7). You see agent 3 at (8, 8).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am at (8, 7). The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 5 units away — a manageable distance. Eating that apple would give me +1.0 point immediately. However, apples only spawn when the river is clean, meaning that cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple generation. The nearest dirt is at (6, 2), which is 7 units away — quite distant.

Currently, there are no apples spawning because the river is not clean. So, if I eat an apple now, I'm getting a reward, but only because one already exists — not because I've enabled future spawning. That means I'm not contributing to the long-term goal of enabling more apples.

Cleaning dirt is not rewarding in the short term, but it's essential for future apple spawning. Since the nearest dirt is at (6, 2), I would need to move toward it to clean it. That path would take me from (8,7) to (6,2): moving left to (6,7), then up or down to reach (6,2). This would take at least 5 steps (e.g., (8,
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 7}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 0). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to determine the best course of action.

Currently, I am at (7, 0). The nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 6 units away — a significant distance. There is no visible apple nearby, and I see nothing of interest in the immediate vicinity. The nearest dirt is at (6, 2), which is only 3 units away. Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning, which in turn benefits the group by increasing apple availability in the long term.

Let’s evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward**: There is no apple in range at this moment. The nearest apple is 6 units away, and I don’t see any apples nearby. Eating an apple would require movement and would only be worthwhile if one were immediately available. Since there is none, this option is not viable right now.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning**: This is a critical action. Dirt must be cleaned to allow apples to spawn. The nearest dirt is at (6, 2), just 3 units away. This is within reach and would directly contribute to enabling apple spawning in the future. Even though cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, it is a
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 2}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 8). You see agent 1 at (8, 7).
  Thinking: I am at (8, 8), and I see Agent 1 at (8, 7) — directly south of me. The nearest apple is at (13, 8), which is 5 steps away, meaning I can reach it in a straight line east. That’s a short, feasible path.

The nearest dirt is at (6, 2), which is 8 steps away — quite far. Cleaning that dirt would require a significant journey and would not yield immediate reward, but it would improve the river’s cleanliness and enable apples to spawn in the future, which benefits the group.

Now, let's evaluate the trade-offs:

1. **Eat an apple now?**  
   Yes — the apple at (13, 8) is within reach (5 steps). Eating it gives me +1.0 point immediately, which increases my score and provides a tangible reward. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt is a long-term, indirect action, the immediate benefit of eating a nearby apple is valuable and strategic.

2. **Clean dirt to help the group?**  
   This is a long-term strategy. However, cleaning dirt requires moving to (6, 2), which is 8 steps

--- Step 26 ---
Moving from (7, 7) towards (6, 2).
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 7). You see agent 3 at (9, 8).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the trade-off between immediate reward and long-term benefit.

Currently, I'm at (7,7). The nearest apple is at (13,7), which is 6 steps away. That’s a reasonable distance — I can reach it with a straight path (moving east). However, I must consider whether there's a dirt patch nearby that I should clean first.

The nearest dirt is at (6,2), which is 6 steps away (distance = √((7-6)² + (7-2)²) = √(1 + 25) = √26 ≈ 5.1). So, it’s actually quite close — only about 5.1 units away. That’s not far, and cleaning it would make apples more likely to spawn in the future, especially since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is reduced).

But here’s the key point: **apples only spawn when the river is clean**. The dirt at (6,2) is not on the river — it’s in a grid cell that may be land. So, cleaning dirt doesn’t directly clean the river unless that dirt is in a river cell. But
  Decision: {'action': 'move_to', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 2}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 0). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 2), even though it provides no immediate reward.

Here's why:

- The nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 7 units away — a significant distance. There are no apples visible nearby, and we have no indication that apples will spawn in the immediate vicinity without first cleaning dirt.
- The dirt at (6, 2) is only 2 units away — very close and directly accessible from my current position (6, 0). This means I can clean it efficiently with minimal movement.
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Since the river is currently dirty, no apples can appear. Cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apple spawning — without it, the group will not be able to gain apples at all.
- Eating an apple now would be pointless because there are no apples visible or accessible near me, and even if there were, they would not spawn unless the river is clean.
- The goal is to maximize points over time. Immediate reward (eating an apple) is not sustainable if no apples are available. Cleaning dirt enables future apple spawning, which leads to long-term point gains.


--- Step 25 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here's my reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — a significant distance. Given that apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), and there's currently dirt at (7, 4) just one step away, this dirt is blocking apple spawning in that region.
- Eating an apple immediately would give +1.0 point, but apples only spawn when the river is clean. Since the dirt is currently present, no apples are spawning — so there's no apple available for me to eat at this moment. The observation says "you see dirt at (7, 4)" — this implies that no apple is currently available for consumption in the immediate vicinity.
- Cleaning the dirt at (7, 4) is a necessary step to enable future apple spawning. Once cleaned, apples may spawn in the area, including potentially near (12, 2), which is the nearest apple. This action supports long-term group goals and enables future rewards.
- There is no immediate apple available for consumption, so choosing to "eat an apple" is not viable.
- Moving to clean the dirt is the only
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to determine the best course of action.

Currently, I am at (7, 2), and I see Agent 1 at (7, 3). The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — a moderate distance. The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), just one step away. That dirt is directly above me, and cleaning it would be a very low-effort action (one move up to (7, 4), then clean).

Now, let's evaluate the trade-offs:

1. **Eating an apple for immediate reward**:  
   - Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.  
   - However, apples only spawn when the river is clean — i.e., when dirt is removed.  
   - Currently, there is dirt at (7, 4), which means apples are not spawning at all.  
   - Therefore, *no apple is available to eat right now*, because the environment is not clean.  
   - Even if I were to eat an apple, it wouldn’t be possible unless the dirt is cleaned first.  
   → So, **I cannot eat an apple immediately**. This option is invalid.

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4) and dirt at (7, 6).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision as Agent 3.

Current position: (7, 5)  
Visible dirt: (7, 4) and (7, 6)  
Nearest apple: (2, 5), distance = 5  
Nearest dirt: (7, 4), distance = 1  

Key observations:
- There is **no apple currently visible** at my position. The nearest apple is 5 steps away — not immediately accessible.
- There is **dirt at (7, 4)**, just one step away. This is the closest dirt, and cleaning it would help the river become cleaner, enabling future apple spawning.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apple generation, even if it doesn't give immediate reward.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0, but there are no apples in immediate range. I cannot eat anything at (7, 5) or adjacent spots because no apple is present.

Therefore:
- **Option 1 (eat an apple)**: Not feasible — no apple is at or adjacent to me.
- **Option 2 (clean dirt)**: Highly beneficial in the long term

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision.

Currently, I am at (7, 3). Agent 2 is at (7, 2), directly above me. There is dirt at (7, 4), which is one step to the right — very close. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 steps away, so it's not immediately accessible. 

Key facts:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawns (which benefit the group).
- I can only move in cardinal directions (up, down, left, right), not diagonally.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately, but only if an apple is present.

Right now, there are no visible apples in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is 6 steps away, and there's no indication that apples are currently spawning. Therefore, I cannot eat an apple *now* — there's no apple in the current field of view or in the immediate area.

The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 step away — very accessible. Cleaning it would:

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision for maximizing points and contributing to the group's success.

Current position: (7, 2)  
Agent 1 is at (7, 3) — directly above me, so we're in the same column, adjacent.  
Nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — that's a fair distance, but reachable.  
Nearest dirt is at (7, 4), which is only 2 units away — very close.

Key trade-off:
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately.  
- Cleaning dirt enables future apple spawning, which benefits the group long-term.  
- However, apples only spawn *when the river is clean*, meaning cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apple generation.

Important observation:  
There are no apples currently visible or nearby (the nearest is 5 units away), and the dirt is right next to me at (7, 4). Since apples don’t spawn on dirty land, cleaning the dirt at (7, 4) is essential to enable apples to appear in the future — especially since the nearest apple is on the same row (row 2), which might be accessible only after the river

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4) and dirt at (7, 6).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away — far from my current position at (7, 5). Eating it would give +1.0 point, but it would not be an immediate or practical gain given the distance and the lack of nearby apple spawns.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 unit away — very close and directly adjacent. Cleaning it will improve the river's cleanliness at that location.
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. By cleaning this dirt, I enable the potential for apples to spawn in the area around (7, 4), which could lead to future apple spawns in the vicinity — possibly even closer to my position or along the path to (2, 5).
- There is no immediate benefit to eating an apple now, especially since it's far away and the path to it is long. Moreover, the group's success depends on enabling future apple spawns through cleaning.
- Cleaning dirt is a necessary precondition for apple spawning, and doing so now is a strategic investment in future rewards rather than a short-term gain.

Therefore, the optimal action is to clean the dirt

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision for maximizing points and contributing to the group's success.

Current position: (7, 3)  
Agent 2 is at (7, 2) — directly above me.  
Dirt is at (7, 4) — directly to my right.  
Nearest apple is at (12, 2), 6 units away.  
The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 unit away — very close.  

Key rule: Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Cleaning dirt enables future apple spawning. There's no immediate reward for cleaning dirt, but it's essential for long-term apple availability.  

Option 1: Eat an apple immediately  
- There's no apple at (7, 3) or nearby. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 steps away.  
- Eating an apple would require moving to a location where one exists — currently, none are within reach.  
- So, I cannot eat an apple right now. This option is not viable.  

Option 2: Clean the dirt at (7, 4)  
Therefore, the optimal action is to clean the dirt at (6, 6). This action supports the group’s long-term success and is a prerequisite for apple spawning. Once cleaned, I can then move toward the nearest apple at
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 6}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 0). You see dirt at (6, 0) and dirt at (7, 0).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 0), and I observe dirt at both (6, 0) and (7, 0). The nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 6 units away — quite far. There is no apple currently visible in my immediate vicinity, and the only dirt present is right where I am.

Let’s analyze the trade-offs:

1. **Should I eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There is no apple at (7, 0) or (6, 0). The nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is out of reach without first cleaning dirt. Eating an apple requires being on land with an apple, and since no apple is currently available, I cannot eat one. So this option is not viable now.

2. **Should I clean dirt to ensure future apples spawn?**  
   → Yes. Dirt removal is essential to enable apple spawning. The rule states that apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt). Since I am currently at a dirt location, cleaning it will help create clean land — potentially enabling apples to spawn later.  
   → Cleaning dirt at (7,0) or (6,0
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 7). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: Given the current situation, let's analyze the trade-offs carefully:

1. **Immediate apple reward**:  
   The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is only 2 steps away. Since apples give +1.0 each, eating one would provide a direct, immediate reward. However, this apple is on land — and land only spawns apples when the river is clean. The key point here is: **is the land currently clean enough to support apple spawning?**

   From the global scan, the nearest dirt is at (6, 6), 5 steps away. That means the current land at (2, 5) is likely already clean or has been cleaned in the past. There's no indication that the river is currently dirty — so it's plausible that apples can spawn there now.

   Therefore, **eating the apple at (2, 5) is both feasible and immediately rewarding**, with no risk of losing future apple spawns due to dirt.

2. **Cleaning dirt to enable future apples**:  
   Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning. However, the dirt at (6, 6) is 5 steps away — a significant distance. Cleaning it would require moving to (6,

--- Step 26 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 6). You see dirt at (6, 6).
  Thinking: I am at (6, 6), which is currently covered in dirt. There are no apples visible in my immediate vicinity — the nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 steps away. The dirt at (6, 6) is the nearest dirt patch, so it's both the closest and only dirt currently present.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There is no apple at (6, 6). I cannot eat an apple here. The nearest apple is far away (distance 5), and there's no indication that any apples are spawning currently because the river is not clean. Apples only spawn when the river is clean — which depends on removing dirt. So, eating an apple is not possible right now. This option is not viable.

2. **Clean the dirt at (6, 6) to enable future apple spawning?**  
   → Yes. Cleaning dirt is essential to allow apples to spawn. Even though cleaning gives no immediate reward, it is a prerequisite for future apple generation. Since apples are only available when the river is clean, and currently no apples are spawning (because of dirt), cleaning this dirt is a necessary step to enable future apple
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 6}} -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 0). You see dirt at (6, 0).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 0).

Here’s the reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible or reachable in immediate proximity. The nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 6 units away — far beyond a direct, immediate action.
- The dirt at (6, 0) is only 1 unit away from my current position (7, 0), making it the closest and most accessible dirt patch.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be removed to enable apple generation. Since no apples are currently spawning, cleaning dirt is a necessary step to enable future apple spawns.
- Eating an apple now would give a +1.0 reward, but there are no apples available for consumption in this state. The apple at (13, 0) is not reachable without first cleaning the dirt that blocks access or enables spawning.
- Cleaning dirt provides no immediate reward, but it is a prerequisite for future apple generation. Since the goal is to maximize points over time (not just immediate gain), and apples are the only source of points, enabling their spawning is strategically vital.
- Moving to (6, 0) to clean dirt is a minimal cost action with maximum long-term benefit.
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 6). You see an apple at (2, 5).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (2, 5).

Reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only 1 step away — this is a direct, low-effort opportunity to earn +1.0 point.
- There is no immediate reward for cleaning dirt at (6, 6), which is 4 steps away. Cleaning dirt is a long-term strategy that enables future apple spawning, but it requires significant movement and time before any benefit is realized.
- Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, cleaning dirt is necessary for future apple growth — but the current situation already has an apple in range. The immediate reward of eating it is both achievable and beneficial.
- The trade-off is between short-term gain (eating the apple) and long-term potential (cleaning dirt). However, in a cleanup game where the goal is to maximize points, and apples are the only direct scoring mechanism, acting on immediate opportunities is optimal unless there's a clear, unavoidable future dependency.
- There is no indication that the dirt at (6, 6) is critical or that future apples depend on it now. The apple at (2, 5) is present and accessible — it's a valid, immediate action.

Therefore, eating the apple is the best choice

--- Step 27 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 6). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: Given the current situation, let's analyze the trade-offs carefully.

You are at (6, 6). The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away — a reasonable distance, but not immediate. The nearest dirt is at (6, 0), 6 units away. Importantly, **apples only spawn when the river is clean**, meaning dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning. Cleaning dirt does not give immediate reward, but it is a prerequisite for future apple generation — which benefits the group.

Right now, there is **no apple visible nearby** (the nearest is 5 units away), and you're not in a position to eat one immediately without movement. Since you can't move diagonally, you’ll need to move step-by-step. The key point is that **apples are not spawning now** because the river (presumably represented by dirt) is still dirty. Cleaning the dirt at (6, 0) would eventually allow apples to spawn — possibly at (2, 5) or elsewhere — which would benefit the group in the long run.

  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 3}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (5, 5). You see dirt at (6, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 4).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (1, 8), which is 7 units away — far from current position (5, 5). Eating it would give +1.0 point, but it would be a long journey with no immediate benefit in terms of future apple spawning.
- The dirt at (6, 4) is only 2 units away — very close. Cleaning it will improve the river's cleanliness, which increases the chance of apples spawning in the future.
- Apples only spawn *when the river is clean*. So, cleaning dirt is not just a maintenance task — it's a prerequisite for future apple generation. Without cleaning, no apples can appear, even if we are very close to them.
- There is no immediate reward for cleaning, but the long-term payoff is critical: more apples will spawn over time, which directly increases total points.
- Since we are at (5,5), moving to (6,4) is a simple, low-cost action (one step right, one step down — valid movement). We can clean it and then plan future movement toward apples.

Therefore, the trade-off favors cleaning dirt over eating an apple. The immediate

--- Step 25 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 0). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: Given the current situation, let's analyze the trade-offs carefully:

1. **Should you eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   The nearest apple is at (1, 8), which is 9 units away. That’s a long distance, and since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), there’s no apple currently available to eat. The observation says "you see nothing of interest nearby," and the global scan confirms the apple is far away. Eating an apple is not possible right now — there’s no apple within reach. So, immediate reward is not feasible.

2. **Should you clean dirt to ensure future apples spawn (helping the group)?**  
   Yes — this is the only viable action. The nearest dirt is at (8, 0), which is 6 units away. Dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning. Since apples are essential for scoring and the group's success, cleaning dirt is a necessary prerequisite. Even though cleaning doesn't give immediate reward, it enables future apple spawns, which are critical for long-term point accumulation. Moreover, since apples only spawn when the river is clean, cleaning dirt is not optional — it’s foundational.

3. **If nothing is nearby,
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see dirt at (7, 3) and dirt at (6, 4).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 3), which is currently covered in dirt. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), 6 units away — a significant distance. However, apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, meaning dirt must be cleaned to enable apple growth. Currently, there is dirt at (7, 3) and (6, 4), so the river is not clean, and no apples are spawning.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple visible at (7, 3) — only dirt. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is far away and currently inaccessible because the land is not clean. Eating an apple would require being on land with an apple, which isn’t possible now. So, **no apple can be eaten immediately**. This option is not viable.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   Yes — cleaning dirt is essential. Dirt at (7, 3) and (6, 4) must be removed to create land where apples can spawn. Since apples only appear when the river is clean, cleaning these spots will eventually allow apples to appear, potentially

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 5). You see dirt at (6, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 4).

Reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (13, 6), which is 8 units away — far beyond immediate reach. Eating it would require a long path and would not provide a meaningful immediate benefit given the distance and the lack of nearby apples.
- The dirt at (6, 4) is only 1 unit away — extremely close. Cleaning it would directly contribute to making the river cleaner, which increases the chance of apple spawning in the future.
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Therefore, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple generation. Without cleaning, even if apples exist elsewhere, they won’t appear.
- There is no immediate reward for eating an apple here — the nearest one is far away, and there are no nearby apples visible in the current scan.
- The goal is to maximize points over time, not just in the short term. Cleaning dirt supports long-term sustainability and enables future apple spawns, which can yield more points later.
- Moving diagonally is not allowed, so movement must be orthogonal — but since (6, 4) is directly adjacent and only one step down, it's a simple, efficient move.

Therefore, the optimal

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (3, 0). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully and make a strategic decision based on the rules and current state.

Current position: (3, 0)  
Nearest Apple: (13, 0) — distance 10  
Nearest Dirt: (8, 0) — distance 5  

Key facts:
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned).
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but enables future apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.
- Movement is only allowed in cardinal directions (up, down, left, right), no diagonals.
- There are no visible apples nearby — the nearest is far at (13, 0).

Now, evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple immediately?**  
   The nearest apple is at (13, 0), 10 steps away. Since we're at (3, 0), we’d need to move right 10 steps to reach it. That’s a long journey. Also, apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning, if the dirt is not cleaned, apples won’t appear at all. So, if we don’t clean the dirt at (
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see dirt at (6, 4) and agent 3 at (6, 4).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 3), and the nearest dirt is at (6, 4), which is directly to my west — just one step away. Agent 3 is currently occupying that spot, which means I cannot move there immediately unless I displace them or wait.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 steps away. There are no apples visible or nearby in the current observation. Eating an apple would require movement to reach it, and since no apple is currently within reach, there is no immediate apple to eat. Therefore, this option is not viable.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   This is a key point. Dirt must be cleaned to allow apples to spawn. The current dirt at (6, 4) is the nearest dirt in the global scan, and cleaning it would make apples possible in that area. Since apples are currently not spawning (no visible apples), cleaning dirt is essential for long-term rewards.  
   Moreover, cleaning dirt is a necessary prerequisite for apple spawning — it gives no immediate reward, but it enables future gains. This action supports the group’s goal of

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (5, 5). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: Given the current situation, I must carefully analyze the trade-offs between immediate reward, long-term sustainability, and strategic movement.

**Current Position:** (5, 5)  
**Nearest Apple:** (1, 8) — distance = 7  
**Nearest Dirt:** (7, 3) — distance = 4  

### Step 1: Can I eat an apple now?
- The nearest apple is 7 units away. That requires moving to (1, 8), which involves a path through potentially dirty or barren terrain.  
- There’s no visible apple in immediate proximity.  
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately — a clear reward.  
- However, apples only spawn *when the river is clean*. This means apples are not guaranteed — they depend on dirt being cleaned.  

So, if I eat an apple now, I get immediate points, but I’m not ensuring future apple spawning. That could mean future rewards are limited or delayed.

### Step 2: Should I clean dirt?
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 3), just 4 units away — much closer than the apple.  
- Cleaning dirt is not rewarding immediately, but it enables future apple spawning.  
- Since apples

--- Step 25 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (1, 1). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 2 at (2, 0).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available at distance 1 — a direct, no-risk, +1.0 reward with no cost.
- There is no dirt nearby to clean (the nearest dirt is at (8, 1), distance 7), so cleaning is not currently viable or urgent. It would take many steps to reach it, and there's no immediate benefit to doing so.
- Agent 2 is at (2, 0), which is adjacent to the apple. If agent 2 were to eat it, they would gain the reward. However, since the apple is at (1, 0), and I'm at (1, 1), I can reach it in one move (down to (1, 0)) while agent 2 is at (2, 0) — they are not in a position to reach it immediately. Therefore, I have a first-mover advantage.
- The rule says apples only spawn when the river is clean — but currently, no apples are spawning because the river is not clean. However, the apple at (1, 0) is already present. This suggests that either the apple is a static spawn (not dependent on

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 0). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 1 at (1, 1).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Here's the reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only 1 step away — this is a direct, positive action with a clear reward of +1.0 point. There is no risk involved, and no delay.
- The dirt at (8, 1) is far away (distance 7), meaning cleaning it would require significant movement and time. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and we don't currently have any apples beyond the one at (1, 0), the long-term benefit of cleaning dirt is not immediately actionable or urgent.
- Agent 1 is at (1, 1), which is adjacent to the apple at (1, 0). This suggests that agent 1 may also be considering the apple — perhaps they are already close. However, since I am at (2, 0), I can reach the apple in one step, while agent 1 would need to move from (1, 1) to (1, 0) to eat it. I have no information about whether agent 1 is prioritizing cleaning or eating, so I cannot assume they will act first.
- There is no immediate threat or blocking condition. The environment

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 5). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 3), even though it doesn't give immediate reward.

Here's the reasoning:

- Apples only spawn when the river is clean, and the current global scan shows the nearest apple is far away at (13, 6) — a distance of 8. This means apples are not currently spawning because the river is dirty.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 3), which is only 3 units away — a very short and feasible path from my current position (6, 5). Moving to (7, 3) requires just one step east, then possibly down or west to clean it (depending on movement rules, but no diagonal movement is allowed).
- Cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apple spawning. Without cleaning, no apples will appear, regardless of how far they might be.
- Eating an apple immediately would be pointless because there are no apples currently visible or accessible. The apple at (13, 6) is not spawning due to the dirty river, so it's not available for consumption.
- Since I have no nearby apples and the only way to enable future apple spawns is by cleaning dirt, the strategic priority is to clear the dirt to enable future apple growth.

  Obs: You are at (1, 1). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 2 at (2, 0).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Here's the reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only 1 step away — this is the closest apple to me, and eating it gives a direct +1.0 point, which is a clear, tangible reward with no risk.
- The nearest dirt is at (8, 1), which is 7 steps away. Cleaning dirt is beneficial for future apple spawning, but it requires significant movement and time. There is no immediate benefit to cleaning dirt now, especially since we are currently in a state where apples are already spawning (as evidenced by the apple at (1, 0)).
- Agent 2 is at (2, 0), which is adjacent to the apple. If agent 2 is also trying to eat the apple, a conflict may arise. However, since the apple is only one step from me, and I can reach it immediately, I have a first-mover advantage. Eating it now ensures I get the point before another agent can claim it.
- There is no indication that the river is currently dirty or that apple spawning is disabled — in fact, the apple is already present. This means the system is already in a state where apples are spawning, so cleaning dirt is

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 0). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 1 at (1, 1).

Reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only 1 step away — this is a direct, low-effort opportunity for +1.0 reward.
- The nearest dirt is at (8, 1), which is 7 steps away. Cleaning it would require significant movement and time, and there is no guarantee that apples will spawn immediately or even that the dirt is even accessible or worth the effort given the current state.
- There is no indication that the river is currently dirty or that apple spawning is currently blocked — the apple is already present, meaning the environment is already in a state where apples can spawn.
- Agent 1 is at (1, 1), which is adjacent to the apple. This suggests that agent 1 may be able to reach it as well, so there's a possible competition. Eating the apple now ensures I get the reward before another agent does — especially since I can move to (1, 0) in one step, while agent 1 would need to move down to (1, 0) from (1, 1), which is also one step.
- Cleaning dirt is a long-term strategy that provides no immediate benefit and requires substantial effort with no

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 3), even though it offers no immediate reward.

Reasoning:

- Apples only spawn when the river is clean, and the current global scan shows the nearest apple is at (13, 6), 7 units away. This means apple spawning is currently disabled due to dirt in the system.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 3), just 2 units away from my current position (7, 5). This is a very short and accessible path — I can move down to (7, 4), then to (7, 3) to clean it.
- Cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apples to spawn. Without cleaning, no apples will appear, even if I walk far. Since the nearest apple is currently out of reach due to the lack of spawning, I cannot benefit from eating it now.
- Eating an apple now would be a wasted action — there's no apple available at my current location or nearby, and no apples will spawn until the river is clean.
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation and decide the best course of action as Agent 1.

Current position: (7, 3)  
Agent 2 is at (7, 2) — directly above me, so we're in close proximity.  
There is dirt at (7, 4) — directly to my right, just one step away.  
Nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 steps away (horizontal distance).  
The dirt at (7,4) is only 1 step away — very close and accessible.

Key considerations:

1. **Immediate reward vs. long-term benefit**  
   - Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.  
   - However, apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed).  
   - Right now, there is dirt at (7,4), which prevents apple spawning in that area.  
   - Since the nearest apple is 6 steps away, it's not immediately accessible.  
   - Cleaning the dirt at (7,4) would enable apple spawning in the river area — potentially leading to more apples in the future.  
   - This is a strategic investment: no immediate reward, but enables future

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am at (7, 2), and I see Agent 1 at (7, 3) — directly above me. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 steps away. That means I'd need to move right 5 times to reach it. The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), which is just one step above me — distance 1. Cleaning that dirt would be extremely efficient and immediate in terms of movement.

Now, let's evaluate the trade-offs:

1. **Eating an apple for immediate reward**:  
   The apple at (12, 2) is far away — 5 steps. Even if I could reach it, the path is long and there's no guarantee of apple spawning unless the river is clean. Also, apples only spawn when the river is clean. So eating an apple now would not help future apple spawning. It’s a short-term gain with no long-term benefit.

2. **Cleaning dirt to enable future apple spawning**:  
   The dirt at (7, 4) is only one step away — I can reach it in one move. Cleaning it would reduce dirt in the river
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4) and dirt at (7, 6).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away. To reach it, I’d need to move through multiple tiles, potentially including more dirt. However, eating an apple now would only give +1.0 point, and there’s no indication that an apple is currently available at my current position (7, 5). There’s no visible apple in the immediate vicinity — only dirt at (7, 4) and (7, 6).

- Cleaning dirt is not rewarding immediately, but it's essential for enabling apple spawning later. The rule states: "Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (less dirt = more apples)." So, if I leave dirt uncleaned, future apple spawns are blocked or reduced.

- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 tile away — the closest possible dirt. This means I can clean it efficiently and immediately. Once cleaned, the land becomes more fertile, increasing the chance of apples spawning in the future, especially in areas like (2, 5), which is currently distant but may benefit from a cleaner environment.

- There’s no immediate benefit to eating

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to make the best decision for maximizing points and contributing to the group's success.

Currently, I am at (7, 3). Agent 2 is at (7, 2), directly above me, and there is dirt at (7, 4), directly to my right. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — a significant distance. The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 unit away, meaning it's very close and accessible.

Key considerations:

1. **Immediate Reward vs. Long-Term Benefit**:
   - Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately, but there are no apples visible nearby. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which requires moving to a faraway location. There's no apple at (7, 3), (7, 2), or (7, 4). So, I cannot eat an apple right now.
   - Cleaning dirt is essential because apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed). Since dirt is present at (7, 4), and apples require a clean river, removing this dirt enables future apple spawning — which benefits

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to determine the best course of action as Agent 2.

Current position: (7, 2)  
Agent 1 is at (7, 3) — directly above me, so we're in the same column.  
Nearest apple is at (12, 2), 5 units away — that’s on the same row, so it's reachable.  
Nearest dirt is at (7, 4), just one step up — distance 2.

Key point: Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned). So, if I don’t clean the dirt at (7,4), no apples will appear in the area, and future apple spawns are blocked.

Right now, there is **no apple visible** in the immediate vicinity — the nearest is 5 steps away. That means I cannot eat an apple immediately. So option 1 (eating an apple for immediate reward) is **not viable**.

Option 2: Cleaning dirt at (7,4) — this is only 2 steps away. Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning. Since apples are the only source of points, and they don’t spawn without clean river
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4) and dirt at (7, 6).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away. That means I would need to move at least 5 steps to reach it. However, apples only spawn when the river is clean — that is, when there is no dirt. Right now, there is dirt at (7, 4) and (7, 6), and the presence of dirt prevents apples from spawning, even if they're nearby.

- The current global scan shows that the nearest dirt is at (7, 4), just one step away from my current position (7, 5). This dirt is blocking apple spawning, so cleaning it is a necessary step to enable future apple generation — which benefits the group.

- Eating an apple immediately would give +1.0 point, but there are no apples currently visible or reachable in a way that would allow me to eat one without first cleaning dirt. Since the nearest apple is at (2,5), and the path to it likely goes through or near the dirt at (7,4), cleaning that dirt may actually be a prerequisite to eventually accessing apples.

- The trade-off is between immediate reward and long-term benefit

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

Currently, I am at (7, 3). Agent 2 is at (7, 2), directly above me. There is dirt at (7, 4), which is directly to my right — just one step away. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 steps away, meaning it's not immediately accessible.

Key considerations:

1. **Immediate reward vs. long-term benefit**:
   - Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately, which is valuable in a scoring game.
   - However, apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be removed. Right now, there is dirt at (7, 4), which is blocking apple spawning in that area. If I don't clean it, future apples won't appear there.
   - Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning — which benefits the entire group, including me.

2. **Proximity and feasibility**:
   - The dirt at (7, 4) is only one step away — I can reach it immediately.
- Agent 2 is at (7, 2), which is adjacent — they may be doing similar work. However, there's no indication they are cleaning or eating, so I should focus on maximizing my own contribution to
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see dirt at (7, 1) and agent 1 at (7, 1).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 2), and I see dirt at (7, 1), which is directly adjacent. Agent 1 is also at (7, 1), so there's a shared location — possibly a point of conflict or cooperation. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away, and the nearest dirt is only 1 unit away.

Let’s analyze the trade-off:

1. **Eating an apple for immediate reward**:  
   There is no apple visible at (7, 2) or nearby. The nearest apple is 5 steps away, so eating one now would require movement and would not provide a benefit unless I'm already in a zone with apples. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is removed), and currently there is dirt at (7, 1), apples are not spawning. Therefore, **eating an apple is not possible right now**, and attempting to go to (12, 2) without cleaning the dirt would not result in apples spawning — it would just be a long walk with no reward.

2. **Cleaning dirt to enable future apple spawning**:  
   Dirt at (7, 1) is the only dirt in the
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 4). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: Given the current situation, let's analyze the trade-offs carefully.

You are at (2, 4). The nearest apple is at (2, 1), which is only 3 steps away — a very short distance. Eating an apple would give you an immediate +1.0 point. This is a clear, accessible reward with no risk.

However, the nearest dirt is at (8, 4), 6 steps away. Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apples to spawn in the future — but it doesn't give any immediate reward. The question is whether the long-term benefit of enabling future apple spawns outweighs the immediate gain of eating one apple now.

But here's the key point: **apples only spawn when the river is clean**. This implies that dirt must be cleaned *before* apples can appear. Right now, there are apples available — at (2, 1) — and they are already present. That means the river is currently clean enough for apples to spawn *now*, so cleaning dirt is not needed to access the current apple. The presence of apples suggests the environment is already in a state where spawning is possible.

Therefore, cleaning dirt is not an urgent necessity — it’s a long-term investment that only becomes valuable if apples

--- Step 26 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 1). You see agent 2 at (7, 2).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation step by step:

- **Current position**: (7, 1)  
- **Agent 2 is at (7, 2)** — directly adjacent, so potential for coordination or conflict, but no immediate threat is indicated.  
- **Nearest Apple**: at (2, 1), distance = 5.  
- **Nearest Dirt**: at (8, 4), distance = 4.  

### Step 1: Can you eat an apple immediately?
The nearest apple is at (2,1), which is 5 units away. You are at (7,1), so you'd need to move left 5 units to reach it. That’s a long path, and you have no indication of whether apples are spawning yet.  

**Important rule**: Apples only spawn *when the river is clean* (i.e., when dirt is cleaned). Since the dirt is at (8,4) — which is 4 units away — it's not yet clean, so **no apples are currently spawning**.  

Therefore, **eating an apple now would be impossible**, because there are no apples available due to the dirty river.  

> So, **option 1 (eat an apple)** is
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 1).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am at (7, 2), and I see Agent 1 at (7, 1) — directly above me. That means there’s a potential for coordination or conflict, but since the goal is to maximize points by eating apples, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), I must consider both immediate and long-term benefits.

Key facts:
- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — that’s a decent distance, but reachable.
- The nearest dirt is at (8, 4), which is only 3 units away — very close.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., after dirt is removed). So cleaning dirt is necessary for future apple spawning, even if it gives no immediate reward.
- I cannot move diagonally, so movement is constrained to cardinal directions.

Now, evaluating the options:

1. **Eat an apple immediately**  
   - Immediate reward: +1.0 point.  
   - But the nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 steps away. I have to move there.
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 3). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision as Agent 3.

Current position: (2, 3)  
Nearest apple: at (2, 1) — directly above, distance = 2  
Nearest dirt: at (8, 4) — far away, distance = 7  

Key considerations:

1. **Immediate reward vs. long-term benefit**  
   - Eating the apple at (2,1) gives +1.0 immediately.  
   - The apple is within reach (only 2 steps away), and no obstacles are mentioned.  
   - However, apples only spawn *when the river is clean*. This implies that cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple generation — not a direct reward, but a necessary condition for more apples to appear.  

2. **Can I clean dirt now?**  
   - The dirt is at (8,4), which is 7 steps away. That’s a significant distance.  
   - Moving to clean it would require a long journey with no immediate benefit.  
   - Since apples are already available nearby, and the river is not yet clean (as dirt exists), the current apple at (2,1) may be *the only one available*

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 1). You see agent 2 at (8, 2).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (8, 4) rather than eating an apple immediately.

Here’s my reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — that's a significant distance. Eating it would give only +1.0 point, but it's not immediately accessible and requires movement.
- The nearest dirt is at (8, 4), just 3 units away — very close and directly in line with my current position at (8, 1). This means I can reach it efficiently in a straight line (up one row).
- The core rule states: *Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (less dirt = more apples)*. So, cleaning dirt is not just a passive action — it enables future apple spawning. This is a strategic, long-term investment.
- Since I am already at (8, 1), moving to (8, 2) is a small step, but agent 2 is already there. That might mean the path is already being monitored or contested. However, there's no indication of conflict — just presence.
- There is no immediate reward in cleaning dirt (no points), but it increases the likelihood of apples spawning in the future.
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 2). You see agent 1 at (8, 1).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (8, 4), even though it doesn't give immediate reward.

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 4 units away. That means I’d have to move at least 4 steps to reach it — a significant distance with no immediate benefit.
- The nearest dirt is at (8, 4), only 2 steps away. Cleaning it would improve the river’s cleanliness, which directly increases the chance of apples spawning in the future.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean. So, by cleaning dirt now, I’m enabling future apple spawns — which benefits the group and increases long-term points.
- I cannot eat an apple immediately because there’s no apple nearby (the nearest is 4 steps away), and I’m not in a position to reach it without first moving.
- There’s no immediate benefit to eating an apple here — it would be a wasted action if I can’t reach one soon.
- Moving to (8, 4) to clean dirt is a low-effort, high-impact action that directly supports the group's long-term success.

- Right

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4) and dirt at (7, 6).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here’s the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away — far from where I currently am at (7, 5). Eating it would require a long journey and gives only +1.0 points, which is a small immediate reward with no guarantee of future yield.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 unit away — very close. Cleaning it would improve the river’s cleanliness, which increases the chance of apples spawning in the future. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, this is a prerequisite for long-term apple availability.
- There is no immediate apple nearby (the nearest is 5 steps away), so the immediate reward of eating an apple is not viable.
- The rule states that cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it is necessary for future apple spawning. This is a strategic investment in sustainability — not just for myself, but for the group.
- Moving to (7, 4) to clean it is a minimal cost (one step) with high long-term value: it enables future apple spawning, potentially allowing more apples to appear in the area, which could be reached later.

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — quite far, and there are no apples visible in the immediate vicinity.
- The only dirt visible is at (7, 4), just one step away from my current position (7, 3). This is the nearest dirt, and cleaning it would directly improve the environment by enabling apple spawning in the future.
- Eating an apple now would give a +1.0 reward, but there are no apples currently visible or accessible. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and we currently have dirt present, there are no apples to be had immediately.
- Cleaning dirt does not provide immediate reward, but it is a prerequisite for apple spawning. Given that the nearest apple is far away, and apples only appear when the river is clean, cleaning this dirt is a necessary step to eventually access apples.
- There is no immediate benefit to moving toward the apple at (12, 2) without first ensuring the environment is clean — it would be inefficient to walk there without enabling apple spawning.
- Since the dirt is directly adjacent and cleaning it is a simple, low-cost action, it maxim

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4) — not eat an apple immediately.

Here’s the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away. That’s a significant distance, and apples only spawn when the river is clean. Since the dirt at (7, 4) is just 2 units away, it’s within reach and directly adjacent to my current position (7, 2). Cleaning it is a low-effort, high-impact action that enables future apple spawning.

- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 point, but only if an apple is already present. However, based on the global scan, apples do *not* spawn unless the river is clean. Therefore, there is no apple at (7, 2) or nearby — the apple at (12, 2) is only available *after* the river is cleaned. So, eating an apple now would be impossible or ineffective.

- Cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apple spawning. By cleaning (7, 4), I'm enabling the potential for apples to appear in the future, which benefits the group. This aligns with the long-term goal of maximizing points through sustainable resource access.

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4) and dirt at (7, 6).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away. That means it's not immediately accessible, and eating it would require a significant movement effort without any guarantee of being able to reach it in one go.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 unit away — the closest dirt to me. This means it's both nearby and strategically important.
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Since dirt blocks apple spawning, removing dirt is a necessary prerequisite for future apple generation. Even though cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, it enables future rewards (apples) to appear.
- There is no immediate apple in range, and the nearest apple is far away. Therefore, consuming an apple now would be a poor trade-off — it would be a wasted action with no benefit in the long run.
- Cleaning dirt at (7, 4) is a low-effort, high-impact action that directly improves the environment for future apple spawning. This aligns with the goal of maximizing points over time, not just immediate gains.

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here’s my reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible in the immediate vicinity (the nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away), and we are not at a location where apples are spawning due to clean land.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is very close — just 1 unit away — meaning it’s within reach and easy to clean.
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Since the dirt is currently blocking apple spawning, cleaning it will enable future apple generation, which benefits the group and increases long-term points.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 immediately, but there are no apples visible or accessible in the current state. Without cleaning dirt, there will be no apples to eat in the near term, regardless of movement.
- Cleaning dirt is a necessary prerequisite for apple spawning. It’s a strategic investment with no immediate reward, but it enables future gains.
- Since agent 2 is at (7, 2), which is directly above me, and we are both on the same column, there's no immediate threat or conflict — so movement is safe.
- Moving to (7, 4
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the trade-off carefully based on the current situation.

I am at (7, 2), and the nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 steps away. That’s a reasonable distance — I can reach it, but it requires movement. However, the key factor is that apples only spawn when the river is clean, meaning dirt must be cleaned first. Right now, the nearest dirt is at (7, 4), just one step above me — distance 2. That means I can reach it quickly and clean it immediately.

Cleaning dirt has no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning. Since apples are essential for scoring and the game’s objective is to maximize points, enabling future apple spawns is a long-term strategy. The apple at (12, 2) is currently not spawning because the river isn’t clean — without cleaning dirt, apples won’t appear at all.

Therefore, the optimal action is to clean the dirt at (6,

**Nearest Apple**: (13, 8) — distance = 4 units (1 move right, then 3 up/down? Wait — let's verify: from (9,8) to (13,8) is 4 units right — that’s a straight horizontal path. So, 4 steps to reach it.)  
**Nearest Dirt**: (6, 2) — distance = |9–6| + |8–2| = 3 + 6 = 9 units. That’s a long way.

**Immediate Option**: Eat an apple at (13,8).  
- This gives +1.0 point immediately.  
- The apple is only 4 steps away — within reach in a few moves.  
- There’s no indication that apples are spawning or being blocked — the apple is visible and reachable.

**Future Option**: Clean dirt at (6,2).  
- Cleaning dirt has no immediate reward.  
- But it’s necessary to enable apples to spawn later — so it supports long-term group goals.  
- However, the dirt is

--- Step 27 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 7). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am currently at (6, 7). The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 units away — a significant distance. The nearest dirt is at (6, 2), just 5 units away in the same column. Since I can't move diagonally, I would need to move in straight lines (up/down/left/right).

Now, let's consider the trade-offs:

1. **Eating an apple for immediate reward (+1.0):**  
   There is no apple visible nearby. The nearest apple is far away (6 units), and I have no information about whether it's accessible or if it's already been eaten. Eating an apple would require reaching it — which is not feasible in one move. So, there's no immediate apple available to eat. This option is not viable right now.

2. **Cleaning dirt to enable future apple spawning:**  
   Dirt cleaning is not rewarding immediately, but it is essential for apples to spawn. The nearest dirt is at (6, 2), only 5 units away. That’s a very manageable distance. Cleaning it would improve the river's cleanliness, increasing the chance of apples appearing in the
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 2}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 1). You see dirt at (6, 2).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 2).

Here’s the reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible in my immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 7 steps away — far beyond immediate reach.
- The dirt at (6, 2) is only 1 step away, meaning it’s directly adjacent and very accessible.
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — i.e., when dirt is removed. So, cleaning this dirt is a prerequisite for future apple spawning.
- Eating an apple now would give a +1.0 reward, but there are no apples available to eat at this moment. There’s no apple within reach, so no immediate action yields reward.
- Cleaning dirt doesn’t give immediate points, but it enables future apple spawning — which directly supports the group's long-term goal of maximizing points.
- Since the dirt is right next to me, and no apple is nearby, there’s no benefit to moving toward an apple now. Instead, cleaning this dirt is a necessary step to eventually access apples (like the one at (12, 2)).

Therefore, the optimal action is to clean the dirt at (6, 2). This ensures that future
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 2}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (10, 8). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to analyze the trade-off carefully.

Right now, I'm at (10, 8). The nearest apple is at (13, 8) — just 3 steps away, which is very close. Eating that apple would give me an immediate +1.0 point, which is a clear, tangible reward.

However, the global scan shows that the nearest dirt is at (6, 2), which is 10 steps away. That means cleaning dirt is not immediately accessible — it requires a significant journey. But the rule states that apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt). So, cleaning dirt enables future apple spawning, which benefits the group. However, cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward — it's purely a long-term investment.

Given that:
- I can eat the apple at (13, 8) in 3 moves (right, right, right) — simple, immediate, and safe.
- There's no indication of danger or obstacles nearby.
- The dirt is far away and not in my immediate vicinity.
- There's no visible incentive to clean dirt *now* — no apples are spawning yet, and the river isn't currently dirty enough to trigger apple generation.

The key point is

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 6). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision.

Currently, I am at (6, 6). The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away — a significant distance. The nearest dirt is at (6, 2), which is only 4 units away. This means I can reach the dirt quickly and clean it, which would improve the environment for future apple spawning.

However, eating an apple gives me +1.0 immediately, which is a direct reward. But apples only spawn when the river is clean — so if I don’t clean dirt, no apples will appear, even if I walk toward them. Since the apple at (2, 5) is currently not spawning (because the river is not clean), I cannot eat it right now — it's not available.

Therefore, the immediate apple is not accessible due to the dirt condition. Eating it now would be impossible, so it's not a viable option.

Cleaning the dirt at (6, 2) is necessary to enable future apple spawning. Once the dirt is cleaned, apples may spawn in areas that were previously unavailable. This supports the group’s long-term goal and increases the chance of future rewards.

Given that:
- I can reach
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 2}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 2). You see dirt at (6, 2) and dirt at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I am at (6, 2), and the current observation shows dirt at (6, 2) and (7, 3). The global scan confirms that the nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — quite far. The nearest dirt is at (6, 2), meaning I’m already standing on dirt.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple visible at my current location (6, 2). The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 steps away. I cannot eat an apple unless I move to a location where one exists. Since no apple is present at (6, 2), eating one is not possible right now. Therefore, this option is not viable.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   This is critical. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned to make land usable. Currently, there is dirt at (6, 2) and (7, 3). Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it is a necessary prerequisite for apples to appear. Since the nearest apple is at (1
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 2}} -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (11, 8). You see an apple at (13, 7) and an apple at (13, 8).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (13, 8).

Here's the reasoning:

- The apple at (13, 8) is only 2 steps away — a very short distance. This gives me immediate +1.0 point, which directly increases my score.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 3), which is 9 steps away. Cleaning it would require a significant movement cost with no immediate reward. Since apples only spawn *when the river is clean*, this action is a long-term investment with no visible payoff now.
- There are no other apples or dirt in close proximity, so there's no immediate alternative action that provides both reward and efficiency.
- The goal is to *maximize points*, and eating an apple gives a direct, tangible reward. Delaying this for a future benefit (more apples) introduces risk — if I don’t eat now, I might miss a chance to gain points when apples spawn, and I have no guarantee that cleaning the dirt will result in apples appearing soon.
- Moving to clean dirt would require navigating through potentially barren or unproductive terrain, and there's no indication that cleaning dirt leads to apples spawning in a predictable or immediate way.

- This is only 1 step away — very

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully.

I am at (7, 2), and I see Agent 1 at (7, 3) — directly above me. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away. The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), which is just one step above me — distance 2.

Key rule: Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward but is necessary to enable apple spawning. So, while eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately, cleaning dirt enables future apple spawns — which benefits the group long-term.

Right now, there is dirt at (7, 4), and I can reach it in one move (up to (7, 4)). Cleaning it would make the river cleaner, which could eventually allow apples to spawn in that area or nearby.

But I must consider: is there any immediate benefit to eating an apple now?

- The apple at (12, 2) is 5 steps away — far away, and I would need to move through potentially dirty or unclean areas to reach it.
- There are no apples visible nearby (no apple within 1-2 steps of me
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4), dirt at (6, 5) and dirt at (7, 6).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4) — not eat an apple, and not explore far yet.

Here’s why:

- Apples only spawn *when the river is clean*, meaning dirt must be removed to enable apple spawning. Right now, there is dirt at (7, 4), (6, 5), and (7, 6). The presence of dirt directly blocks apple generation. Since the nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away, and we’re at (7, 5), we are not in close proximity to any apple *yet* — the apple is only available *after* the environment is cleaned.

- Eating an apple now would give +1.0, but that apple is not currently spawning because the river (or land) is dirty. Therefore, the apple at (2, 5) is not accessible — it’s not just out of reach, it’s *blocked by dirt*. So, eating an apple would be impossible or invalid in this state.

- Cleaning dirt at (7, 4) is the closest dirt (distance 1), and it’s a high-priority action. Removing it would reduce dirt in the environment and increase the chance for apples to

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — quite far. Eating it immediately would give only +1.0 point, but it's not in immediate reach.
- There is dirt at (7, 4), just one step away from my current position (7, 3). Cleaning this dirt is a direct action that will improve the environment for future apple spawning. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt), removing this dirt will increase the likelihood of apples appearing in the area.
- The global scan shows that the nearest dirt is only 1 unit away — extremely close. This means cleaning it is a low-effort, high-impact action that directly contributes to the group's long-term goal of apple spawning.
- Eating an apple now would provide immediate reward, but it would not help the group's ability to spawn more apples in the future. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and we have a dirt block just one step away, cleaning it is a necessary step to enable future apple generation — especially since the nearest apple is far away and not currently spawning.
- There is no nearby apple

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision as Agent 2.

Current position: (7, 2)  
Agent 1 is at (7, 3) — directly above me, so we're in the same column.  
Nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away (same row, moving right).  
Nearest dirt is at (7, 4), just one step above me — distance = 2.

Key points:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed).
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward but enables future apple spawning.
- I cannot move diagonally — so movement is constrained to cardinal directions.

Now, the trade-off:

1. **Eat an apple?**  
   The nearest apple is at (12, 2), 5 steps away. That's far. To reach it, I'd have to move right to (12, 2), which is a long path. Also, if I eat it now, I get +1.0, but I’m not near any apple yet — I’d have to travel to get to it
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4), dirt at (6, 5) and dirt at (7, 6).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision as Agent 3.

Current position: (7, 5)  
Visible dirt: (7, 4), (6, 5), (7, 6)  
Nearest apple: (2, 5), distance 5  
Nearest dirt: (7, 4), distance 1  

Let’s evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward**  
   - The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away.  
   - Moving to (2, 5) would require traversing through multiple tiles — likely passing over or near dirt.  
   - Since there's no apple visible in immediate proximity (within 1 tile), and the nearest is far, eating one now would require significant movement and time.  
   - Moreover, the apple only spawns when the river is clean — meaning that if dirt remains, apples don’t spawn. So, if I don’t clean dirt, no apples will appear.  
   - Therefore, **eating an apple now is not viable**, as there is no apple in range.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning**  
   - Dirt at (7,

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Reasoning:

- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Currently, there is dirt at (7, 4), which is very close (distance 1). This dirt is blocking apple spawning in that area, and since the nearest apple is at (12, 2) — a distance of 6 — it's not immediately accessible anyway.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 point, but there are no apples visible nearby. The nearest apple is far away, and without cleaning the dirt, apples won't spawn at all in the vicinity, making future apple collection impossible.
- Cleaning dirt is a necessary prerequisite for apple spawning. Even though it provides no immediate reward, it enables future apple growth and supports the group's long-term goal.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is adjacent to my current position (7, 3), so I can reach it in one move. This makes it a low-effort, high-impact action.
- Since I am already at (7, 3), I can move to (7, 4) to clean it, then proceed to explore toward the nearest apple at (12, 2)
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the trade-off carefully based on the current situation.

I am at (7, 2), and I see Agent 1 at (7, 3) — directly above me. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away, requiring movement along the row. The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), just one step above me — distance 2. That dirt is within very short reach.

Now, consider the rules:
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt).
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but enables future apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately.
- I cannot move diagonally — so movement is only horizontal or vertical.

**Option 1: Eat an apple immediately**
- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 steps away. I can't reach it in one move.
- There is no apple visible in immediate proximity (no apple at (7, 3) or (7, 2) — I'm at (7, 2), and the global scan says the nearest is at (12, 2)).
However, **eating an apple now would give +1.0 immediately**, but only if one is available. Since the apple at (2,

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 0). You see dirt at (6, 0).
  Thinking: I am at (6, 0), and I see dirt there. The nearest apple is at (13, 0), 7 units away — far enough that I cannot reach it in one move, and there's no indication of any apples spawning yet because the river is not clean.

Right now, there's no apple available for immediate consumption. The only item visible is dirt at (6, 0), which means the river is currently dirty — and apples only spawn when the river is clean. Therefore, **eating an apple is not possible at this moment**.

Cleaning the dirt at (6, 0) would be a necessary step to enable future apple spawning. Even though cleaning doesn't give immediate reward, it enables the possibility of apples appearing downstream — specifically at (13, 0) — which is the nearest apple location. Since apples spawn only when the river is clean, cleaning the dirt is essential to unlock future rewards.

Additionally, there's no nearby apple, and no other dirt or apple locations are visible in the global scan. Moving to explore other areas would be speculative and inefficient without a clear path to clean dirt or find apples.

### Trade-off Analysis:
- **Eating an apple**: Not possible — no apple is visible or

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 5). You see an apple at (2, 5).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (2, 5).

Reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available at my current position (2, 5), with a distance of 0. This means I can consume it instantly and gain +1.0 point — a direct, no-risk reward.
- The nearest dirt is at (6, 0), which is 9 units away. Cleaning it would require movement and time, and there is no immediate benefit from cleaning unless apples are expected to spawn in the future. However, since no apples are currently spawning (and the only apple is at (2,5)), there’s no urgent need to clean dirt.
- The goal is to maximize points. Eating the apple gives immediate value. Cleaning dirt offers future potential, but only if apples spawn after cleaning — which is not guaranteed or visible in the current state.
- There is no indication that apples will spawn elsewhere or that cleaning dirt is necessary for survival or progress. In the absence of such signals, acting on immediate, available rewards is optimal.

Therefore, the best action is to eat the apple at (2, 5) — it provides immediate, tangible reward with zero risk, and no evidence supports the need to spend time cleaning dirt now.

--- Step 28 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (5, 6). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: Given the current situation, I need to carefully analyze the trade-offs between immediate reward and long-term benefit.

**Current Position:** (5, 6)  
**Nearest Apple:** (13, 6) — 8 units away  
**Nearest Dirt:** (8, 1) — 8 units away  

The apple at (13, 6) is on the same horizontal line, so moving east along row 6 is straightforward. However, there's no indication that apples spawn immediately — they only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned). The global scan shows that dirt is at (8,1), which is far from the apple at (13,6). This suggests that cleaning that dirt may not directly benefit the apple at (13,6) unless the dirt is on a path that affects the river.

But here's the key: **apples only spawn when the river is clean**. That means dirt must be cleaned *somewhere* to enable apple spawning. If the dirt at (8,1) is part of the river system, cleaning it would make apples possible elsewhere — possibly including (13,6) — but only after the dirt is cleaned.

Now, evaluating
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 0). You see dirt at (8, 1).
  Thinking: I am at (6, 0) and see dirt at (8, 1). The nearest apple is at (13, 0), 7 units away, while the nearest dirt is only 3 units away — very close and reachable. 

Right now, there are no apples visible in the immediate vicinity. The only apple is far away, and apples only spawn *when the river is clean* — meaning cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple spawning. Since dirt at (8,1) is within reach (distance 3), and we are at (6,0), I can move to (7,0) → (8,0) → (8,1) to clean it.

Key trade-off analysis:

1. **Eat an apple now?**  
   There is no apple nearby. The nearest apple is at (13,0), which requires a long path and no immediate benefit. Eating an apple now would give +1.0, but only if one is available. Since none are in range, this option is not viable.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apples?**  
   Yes — this is essential. Dirt blocks apple spawning. By cleaning (8,1), I enable the possibility of apples

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 5). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the trade-off between immediate rewards and long-term benefits in this cleanup game.

Currently, I am at (2, 5). The nearest apple is at (13, 6), which is 12 steps away — quite distant. There is no visible apple nearby, and I see nothing of interest in the immediate vicinity. The nearest dirt is at (8, 1), which is 10 steps away — also a significant distance.

Now, let’s evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple in sight, and the nearest apple is far away (12 steps). Eating an apple would require moving to that location, which is not efficient. Since there's no apple within range, this option is not viable right now. Also, in this game, apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned first. Without cleaning dirt, apples won’t appear. So, eating an apple immediately is not possible at this moment.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   This is a critical point. The rule states that apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt). Therefore, cleaning dirt is a

--- Step 29 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 6). You see dirt at (6, 5) and dirt at (7, 7).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision.

Current position: (6, 6)  
Visible dirt: (6, 5) and (7, 7)  
Nearest apple: (13, 6), distance = 7  
Nearest dirt: (6, 5), distance = 1  

Key facts:
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when there is no dirt).
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward but is necessary to enable apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.
- Movement is only allowed in cardinal directions (up, down, left, right) — no diagonals.
- The goal is to maximize points over time.

Now, consider the options:

1. **Eat an apple at (13, 6)** — This is 7 units away. Given the distance, it's not immediately accessible. Also, there's no apple in immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is far away, and we're not currently on land adjacent to any apple. So eating an apple now is not feasible without movement.

2. **Clean dirt at (6, 5)** — This is only 1 unit away (directly

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 0). You see dirt at (8, 1).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully.

Currently, I am at (7, 0). The nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 6 units away — quite far. The nearest dirt is at (8, 1), which is just 1 unit away (distance = √[(8-7)² + (1-0)²] = √2 ≈ 1.41). That dirt is very close and directly adjacent — I can reach it in one move (up to (8,1)).

Now, the trade-off:

1. **Eat an apple** — immediate +1.0 reward. But there's no apple nearby (nearest is 6 units away), so I cannot eat one right now. Eating would require moving to a location with an apple, which is far off. That would be inefficient and wastes time.

- By cleaning the dirt, I enable the possibility of future apple spawning, which benefits both myself and the group. This aligns with the goal of maximizing points *over time* through strategic, long-term actions.

--- Step 27 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (1, 1). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 2 at (2, 0).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only 1 step away — this is a direct, positive action with a clear +1.0 reward.
- The nearest dirt is at (8, 1), which is 7 steps away — cleaning it would take significant time and effort with no immediate benefit. Since apples only spawn *when the river is clean*, cleaning dirt is a long-term strategy, not a short-term necessity.
- There is no indication that the river is currently dirty or that cleaning is urgent. The global scan shows no current dirt affecting the environment — only a distant dirt location.
- Agent 2 is at (2, 0), which is adjacent to the apple. If agent 2 is also aiming to eat the apple, there's a potential conflict. However, since we are not told that agent 2 is already eating or has priority, and since we are not restricted from acting independently, eating the apple now maximizes our immediate reward without risk.
- There is no immediate benefit to cleaning dirt — no apples are currently spawning, and we have no information about future apple spawns being dependent on immediate actions.

Therefore, the optimal choice is to eat the apple at (1
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 1, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 0). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 1 at (1, 1).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Here's the reasoning:

- The apple is directly adjacent (distance 1) and provides an immediate +1.0 reward. This is a clear, accessible, and high-value opportunity with no risk.
- The nearest dirt is at (8, 1), which is 7 units away — far beyond any immediate benefit. Cleaning it would require significant movement and time, with no immediate reward or guaranteed future apple spawn until the river is clean. Given the current state, there's no evidence that cleaning dirt will yield apples faster than simply collecting what's available now.
- Agent 1 is at (1, 1), which is adjacent to the apple at (1, 0). If I eat the apple, I don’t risk conflict or interference — I simply take a reward from a location that is currently safe and available.
- There’s no indication that the dirt needs to be cleaned *now* or that future apple spawns are dependent on immediate action. The rule states apples only spawn when the river is clean, but that doesn’t mean they spawn immediately or that cleaning is urgent. The global scan shows the dirt is far away — so cleaning it is not a priority at this moment.
- In a

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 4). You see dirt at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 3).

Here's the reasoning:

- There are no apples visible in immediate proximity (the nearest apple is at (12, 2), 7 units away), and we are currently at (7, 4), with dirt directly below us at (7, 3). This dirt is very close — only 1 unit away — making it a high-priority target.
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Since the dirt at (7, 3) is blocking apple spawning, cleaning it is a necessary prerequisite to enable future apple generation. Without cleaning it, we cannot access apples in that region — and even if we reach (12, 2), the apples may not spawn due to dirt blocking the land.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0, but there are no apples in the immediate vicinity. The apple at (12, 2) is too far and depends on the river being clean. If we don’t clean the dirt at (7, 3), the river won’t be clean, and apples won’t spawn at all — making the apple at (12, 2) inaccessible.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward,

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (1, 1). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 2 at (2, 0).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only 1 step away — this is a direct, no-risk opportunity for +1.0 point.
- There is no immediate benefit to cleaning dirt at (8, 1), which is 7 steps away. The dirt cleaning action has no immediate reward and would require significant movement and time before any apples might spawn.
- Agent 2 is at (2, 0), adjacent to the apple. If I don’t act now, that agent might eat the apple first, reducing my reward. Since I can move to (1,0) in one step, I have a clear advantage in timing.
- The global scan shows that apples only spawn when the river is clean, but that is a long-term, indirect condition. Without immediate access to an apple, waiting to clean dirt would mean missing out on immediate rewards and possibly losing the apple to another agent.
- Given the rules and current state — immediate apple, no danger, no urgency to clean — the optimal strategy is to maximize immediate points while minimizing risk.

Therefore, I should eat the apple at (1, 0) now.
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 1, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 0). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 1 at (1, 1).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only 1 step away — this is a direct, positive reward (+1.0 point) with no risk.
- The nearest dirt is at (8, 1), which is 7 steps away. Cleaning it would require significant movement and time, and there is no immediate benefit from cleaning it — apples only spawn when the river is clean, but we don’t have any information that the river is currently dirty or that apple spawning is currently blocked. The apple at (1, 0) is already present, meaning the river is already clean enough to allow apple spawning.
- Agent 1 is at (1, 1), which is adjacent to the apple. If I don’t eat it now, I risk it being eaten by agent 1 before I can. Since I can move to (1, 0) in one step and agent 1 would take one step to reach it, I must act quickly.
- There is no clear benefit to cleaning dirt now — the apple is already spawning, and there’s no indication that future apples depend on cleaning dirt at (8, 1) in the short term.
- In a cleanup game,
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 1, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see dirt at (8, 2) and dirt at (7, 3).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

**Current Position:** (7, 3)  
**Observed Dirt:** (8, 2) and (7, 3) — so dirt is directly at the current location and one step northeast.  
**Nearest Apple:** (12, 2), which is 6 steps away.  
**Global Scan:** The nearest dirt is at distance 0 — meaning we are *already* on dirt.  

Now, consider the rules and objectives:

- **Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean** (i.e., when there is less dirt).  
- **Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward** — it's a prerequisite for future apple spawning.  
- **Eating an apple gives +1.0 point** — immediate reward.  
- **We cannot move diagonally** — so movement is restricted to cardinal directions (up, down, left, right).  

### Key Observations:
- There is **no apple visible in the immediate vicinity**. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 steps away — far from current position.  
- We are **already standing on dirt** at (7, 3), and there's dirt at (
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 3}} -> Env Action: 'clean'
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 4). You see agent 2 at (7, 3) and dirt at (6, 4).
  Thinking: I am at (6, 4), which is where both the dirt and my current position are located. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 8 units away — a significant distance. There is no apple in immediate vicinity, and the only dirt visible is directly at (6, 4), which is also my current location.

Let’s evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There is no apple at (6, 4). The nearest apple is at (12, 2), far away. Eating an apple would require movement and time, and there’s no apple available immediately. So, no immediate reward is possible here. This option is not viable.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   → The dirt at (6, 4) is directly where I am. Cleaning it would remove dirt from that location, which could increase the chance of apple spawning in the future — especially since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt).  
   → This is a long-term strategy that benefits the group. Since apples are not currently spawning (no visible apples nearby), cleaning dirt is a necessary prerequisite for future apple generation

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (4, 0). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully and make a strategic decision based on the game rules and current state.

Current position: (4, 0)  
Nearest Apple: (13, 0) — 9 units away  
Nearest Dirt: (8, 0) — 4 units away  

Key observations:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed).
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but enables future apple spawning — which benefits the group.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.
- Movement is only allowed in cardinal directions (up, down, left, right) — no diagonals.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple?**  
   The nearest apple is 9 units away. To reach it, I'd need to go from (4,0) to (13,0), which is a straight path along the x-axis. But there's dirt at (8,0), which is 4 units away — meaning the river is currently dirty, and apples are not spawning. Even if I reach the apple, it may not be available — because apple spawning depends on clean river conditions. So, if the dirt remains
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 3). You see agent 3 at (6, 4).
  Thinking: I am at (6, 3), and I see Agent 3 at (6, 4) — directly above me, so we're in the same column. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 7 units away (a long distance), and the nearest dirt is at (8, 0), which is 5 units away. 

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eating an apple for immediate reward**  
   There are no apples visible in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is far away. To reach it, I’d need to move right and down — but that path may be blocked or require cleaning dirt first. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and there's currently dirt at (8, 0), there's no apple spawning yet. Therefore, **there are no apples available to eat at this moment**. Eating one would require movement to a location where apples exist — which only happens after dirt is cleaned.

2. **Cleaning dirt to enable future apple spawning**  
   This is critical. Dirt must be cleaned to allow apples to spawn. The nearest dirt is at (8,
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 4). You see agent 2 at (6, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to determine the best course of action.

Currently, I am at (6, 4), and I see Agent 2 at (6, 3) — directly below me, so we're in close proximity. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 8 units away (a significant distance). The nearest dirt is at (8, 0), which is 6 units away — meaning I'd need to move down and right to reach it.

Now, evaluating the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward**  
   - Apples give +1.0 each — a clear, immediate reward.  
   - However, the nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is far from my current position.  
   - To reach it, I’d need to move: from (6,4) → (6,3) → (6,2) → (6,1) → (6,0) → (7,0) → (8,0) → (9,0) → (10,0) → (11,0) → (12,0) → (12,1) → (1

--- Step 28 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (5, 0). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (8, 0) to enable future apple spawning.

Here's the reasoning:

- There are no apples visible nearby at (5, 0). The nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 8 units away — far beyond immediate reach.
- The nearest dirt is at (8, 0), just 3 units away. This is within reach and directly on the path toward the apple at (13, 0).
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 point, but there are no apples currently available to eat. The apple at (13, 0) is not spawnable unless the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned first.
- Cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apple spawning. Without cleaning, no apples will appear, regardless of how far they are.
- Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), cleaning dirt is not just a "future" action — it's a necessary condition for any apple to exist at all.
- Therefore, cleaning dirt at (8, 0) is a prerequisite for accessing the apple at (13, 0) in the future. Skipping this step would result in no apples
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 3 at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 5), which is only 2 units away — a very short and feasible move.

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — a significant distance. Eating it would require a long path and would not yield immediate, reliable rewards unless apples are consistently spawning.
- However, apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be removed. Right now, there is dirt at (7, 5), and since apples require a clean river, this dirt is actively preventing apple spawning.
- Cleaning this dirt will improve the environment for future apple generation — enabling more apples to spawn in the future, which benefits the group and increases long-term points.
- There is no immediate reward for cleaning dirt, but it's a necessary prerequisite for apple spawning. Without cleaning, apples won't appear, regardless of how far they are.
- The agent at (7, 4) is nearby, but there's no indication they're actively cleaning or eating. Since we are an agent with a goal to maximize points, we should prioritize enabling future opportunities over short-term gains.
- Moving to (7, 5) is straightforward (one step down), and
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 5}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 4). You see agent 2 at (7, 3) and dirt at (7, 5).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 5).

Here’s my reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 7 units away — far out of reach in a single path without intermediate actions. Eating it would require a long journey, and since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), there’s no apple available *now*.
- There is dirt at (7, 5), just one step away from my current position (7, 4). This is the nearest dirt globally and is within immediate reach.
- Cleaning dirt has no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning. Since apples spawn *only when the river is clean*, removing this dirt will allow apples to appear in the area, which benefits the entire group — including me — in the future.
- I cannot eat an apple now because there is no apple in sight (no apple is in the vicinity of (7,4) or (7,5)). The apple at (12,2) is too distant and currently inaccessible due to the lack of clean river conditions.
   - The apple at (12, 2) is 6 steps away — I'd
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4), even though it doesn't give immediate reward.

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — far from my current position at (7, 2). There are no apples visible in immediate proximity, so eating one now would not be efficient or strategic.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), just one step away — a very short distance. Cleaning it would improve the river's cleanliness and enable apple spawning in the future.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean. Without cleaning dirt, apples won’t appear, even if we’re close to them. This means we’re essentially blocking our own progress.
- Since I’m at (7, 2) and agent 1 is at (7, 3), we’re in a vertical line. Moving to (7, 4) to clean dirt is safe, straightforward, and only requires one step.
- Cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apple spawning. If we don’t do it, we can’t get apples — and the group’s goal of maximizing points is undermined.

Therefore, the immediate reward of eating an apple is not worth it — there’s
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4), dirt at (6, 5) and dirt at (7, 6).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully and make a strategic decision based on the rules and current state.

Currently, I am at (7, 5). I see dirt at (7, 4), (6, 5), and (7, 6). The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 steps away — quite far. The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), just 1 step away. This suggests that cleaning dirt is both feasible and immediately accessible.

Now, evaluating the trade-offs:

1. **Eating an apple for immediate reward**:  
   There are no apples visible in immediate range. The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which requires moving left 5 steps — a long journey. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), and no apples are currently spawning, there is no apple available for immediate consumption. Therefore, eating an apple is not possible right now. Even if I could reach it, the path would be long and inefficient without first cleaning dirt to enable spawning.

2. **Cleaning dirt to enable future apple spawning**:  
   Cleaning dirt is essential — it directly affects whether apples can spawn. Right now, dirt is blocking access

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here’s the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — quite far. There’s no apple in immediate range (within 1 or 2 steps), and the only apple spawn condition is when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is removed). 
- Right now, there is dirt at (7, 4), just one step away from me at (7, 3). This dirt is directly blocking apple spawning in that region. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), removing this dirt is a prerequisite for future apple generation.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0, but there are no apples visible nearby — and even if there were, they would only spawn *after* dirt is cleaned. Therefore, immediate apple consumption is not viable or strategic.
- Cleaning the dirt at (7, 4) is a necessary step to enable future apple spawning — which benefits the group (as per the goal of maximizing points through collective success). This action has no immediate reward, but it enables long-term gains.
- Moving to (7, 4) to clean it is a
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the trade-off between immediate reward and long-term group benefit.

Currently, I'm at (7, 2), and I see Agent 1 at (7, 3) — they are directly adjacent, so there's potential for coordination or conflict. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 steps away — quite a distance. However, the nearest dirt is at (7, 4), only 2 steps away. That means I can reach the dirt quickly and clean it to enable apple spawning in the future.

Key points:
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately, but apples only spawn when the river is clean. If I don't clean dirt, apples won't appear at all.
- Cleaning dirt has no immediate reward, but it's essential for enabling future apple spawns — which benefits the entire group.
- Since the dirt is only 2 steps away (and I'm at (7,2)), I can clean it in just one move (to (7,3)) — but wait, (7,3) is where Agent 1 is currently located.

Ah — this is critical. I cannot clean dirt at (7,4) if I am at (7,2
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4), dirt at (6, 5) and dirt at (7, 6).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here's the reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible in immediate range. The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away — far beyond immediate reach. Eating an apple now is not feasible because there are no apples within reach.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is the nearest dirt (distance 1), meaning it's directly adjacent and easily accessible.
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be removed to enable apple spawning. This is a critical rule: cleaning dirt is not immediately rewarding, but it enables future apple generation, which benefits the group.
- Since there are no apples available to eat, choosing to eat one would be impossible and would result in zero reward.
- Cleaning dirt at (7, 4) is a low-effort, high-impact action that directly supports the long-term goal of enabling apple spawning. It's a necessary step toward creating a sustainable environment where apples can eventually appear.
- The global scan shows that dirt is present and accessible — this is a strategic opportunity to improve the environment before apples can spawn.

Therefore, the optimal action is to clean the dirt at (7, 4

--- Step 29 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to determine the best course of action.

Currently, I am at (7, 3). Agent 2 is at (7, 2), directly above me, and there is dirt at (7, 4), directly to my right. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — quite far. The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 unit away, meaning it's very close and easily accessible.

Now, let’s evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward**  
   - There is no apple visible in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which requires moving 6 steps (e.g., right to (7, 4), then up/down, then right to (12, 2)).  
   - There is no apple at (7, 3) or adjacent cells.  
   - Eating an apple requires being at an apple's location, which is not currently available.  
   → **Not feasible right now**.

2. **Clean the dirt at (7, 4)**  
   - Dirt cleaning is necessary to enable apple spawning.  
   - The

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision.

Current position: (7, 2)  
Agent 1 is at (7, 3) — directly above me, so we're in close proximity.  
Nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — that's a decent distance, but reachable.  
Nearest dirt is at (7, 4), only 2 units away — very close.  

Key insight: Apples only spawn when the river is clean. Dirt cleaning is not rewarding immediately, but it enables future apple spawning. Since apples are essential for scoring, and we're currently at a point where cleaning dirt is both close and necessary for future apple access, I should prioritize cleaning.

But wait — is there a trade-off between immediate reward and long-term benefit?

Option 1: Eat an apple at (12, 2)  
- Immediate +1.0 point  
- But the apple is 5 steps away — I’d need to walk there.  
- If I go to (12, 2), I leave the dirt at (7, 4) uncleaned, which means future apple spawning is blocked.  
Therefore, the optimal choice is to clean the dirt at (8, 4). This

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 2). You see an apple at (2, 1).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (2, 1).

Reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only 1 step away — this is the closest apple to my current position, and eating it gives a direct +1.0 reward with no risk or cost.
- The nearest dirt is at (8, 4), which is 8 steps away — this is far from my current location, and cleaning it would require significant movement and time before any future apples could spawn.
- Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, cleaning dirt is a long-term strategy that provides future rewards but no immediate benefit. In this situation, there is no immediate need to clean dirt — the apple is already present and within reach.
- There is no indication that cleaning dirt is necessary or imminent; the global scan shows no nearby dirt or apple spawn triggers.
- The rule states that cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, so investing effort in cleaning now would be inefficient when a clear, immediate reward (eating the apple) is available.

Therefore, the optimal decision is to eat the apple at (2, 1) to maximize immediate points. Afterward, I can assess whether cleaning dirt becomes relevant in the future, but right now, the trade-off favors immediate action.

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 2). You see agent 2 at (8, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to determine the best course of action.

I am at (8, 2), and I see Agent 2 at (8, 3) — directly to my right. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 4 steps away. The nearest dirt is at (8, 4), just one step above me — a distance of 2. 

Key points:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned). So, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately, which is a direct reward.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward but enables future apple spawning, which benefits the group.
- I cannot move diagonally, so movement is constrained to cardinal directions.

Now, the trade-off:
1. **Eat an apple now?**  
   The apple at (12, 2) is 4 steps away — that would require moving right to (8,3), then (8,4), (8,5), (8,6), (8,7), (8,8), (9,8), (10,8), (11,

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 3). You see agent 1 at (8, 2) and dirt at (8, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (8, 4).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — quite distant. There are no apples currently visible in the immediate vicinity (only dirt at (8, 4)), and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed). 
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 point, but there are no apples visible nearby. The only apple in the global scan is far away, and it won’t spawn unless the river is clean.
- The dirt at (8, 4) is only 1 unit away — very close. Cleaning it would improve the river's cleanliness, which in turn enables apples to spawn in the future. This is a necessary step to access the apple at (12, 2) or any other apples that may appear downstream.
- Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and we have no immediate access to apples, the only viable path to future rewards is to clean the dirt.
- Moving diagonally is not allowed, so movement is constrained to cardinal directions. From (8,3), I can move to (8,4) to clean it —

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 1). You see an apple at (1, 0) and an apple at (2, 1).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (2, 1).

Reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available at (2, 1), which is my current position. This gives me a direct +1.0 reward with no risk or cost.
- The nearest dirt is at (8, 4), which is 9 units away — far beyond immediate reach. Cleaning it would require significant movement and time, and since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is reduced), the benefit of future apples is not guaranteed or imminent.
- There is no immediate benefit to cleaning dirt now — the apple spawning condition is not triggered until the river is clean, and we have no information about how much dirt must be removed or when apples will spawn.
- Since I can eat the apple at (2, 1) without any cost and it provides a clear, immediate reward, it is optimal to do so.
- The trade-off between immediate reward and future potential is heavily skewed in favor of immediate action: there's no evidence that cleaning dirt will yield more apples in a way that outweighs the immediate +1.0 from eating the apple.

Additionally, the apple at (1, 0) is farther away (distance 1), and I

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 3). You see dirt at (8, 4) and agent 2 at (8, 4).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am at (8, 3). There is dirt at (8, 4), which is directly adjacent and only 1 step away. Agent 2 is also at (8, 4), so they are both present at the dirt location. This suggests that the dirt is currently occupied and possibly being contested or used by another agent.

The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 steps away. That means I cannot reach it directly without first cleaning the dirt at (8, 4) — because dirt blocks apple spawning. Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when there is no dirt). So, if I don’t clean the dirt, no apples will spawn, and I will be unable to access the apple at (12, 2) or any others.

Option 1: Eat an apple for immediate reward — But there is no apple visible at my current position. The nearest apple is 5 steps away, and it won't spawn unless the dirt is cleaned. So, I cannot eat an apple now.

Option 2: Clean the dirt at (8, 4) — This is necessary to enable apple
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 4). You see agent 1 at (8, 3), dirt at (8, 4) and dirt at (8, 5).
  Thinking: I am at (8, 4), and I observe that there is dirt at both (8, 4) and (8, 5). Agent 1 is at (8, 3), which is directly above me. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — a significant distance. The global scan confirms that the nearest dirt is at (8, 4), meaning we are currently at a dirt location, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed).

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple visible in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is not reachable without first cleaning the dirt. Eating an apple would require being on land with an apple, and currently, we are on dirt. So, **eating an apple is not possible now**. This option is invalid.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   Yes — cleaning dirt is essential. Dirt at (8, 4) and (8, 5) prevents apple spawning. Removing dirt at (8, 4) would be the first step
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 1). You see an apple at (1, 0).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Here's the reasoning:

- The apple at (1, 0) is within reach — it's only 2 steps away (one step left to (1, 1), then one step down to (1, 0)), and I am currently at (2, 1). This means I can reach it in two moves: move left to (1, 1), then down to (1, 0).
- The nearest dirt is at (8, 4), which is 9 steps away. That is extremely far, and cleaning it would require a significant investment of time and movement with no immediate reward. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, cleaning dirt is a long-term strategy, but it doesn’t guarantee immediate apple availability — and in this case, an apple is already visible and accessible.
- There is no indication that the dirt at (8, 4) is currently affecting the spawning of apples in the immediate vicinity. The apple at (1, 0) is already present, which means the river is already clean enough for apple spawning *now*.
If I eat the apple now, I get +1.0 immediately, but I’m sacrificing the opportunity to clean dirt and enable future apple spawns. Since there’s no apple currently available near me (the nearest is 5 steps away), and the dirt is only 2 steps away, cleaning it is a high-priority action
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4), dirt at (6, 5) and dirt at (7, 6).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

You are currently at (7, 5).  
You observe dirt at (7, 4), (6, 5), and (7, 6).  
The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 steps away.  
The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), only 1 step away — meaning it's very close and accessible.

### Option 1: Eat an apple for immediate reward?
- Apples give +1.0 each, which is valuable.
- However, the nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 steps away — a significant distance.
- You would have to move through potentially dirty terrain to get there.
- There's no apple nearby (within 1 or 2 steps), so no immediate apple is available to eat now.

👉 **No immediate apple is available to eat**. Eating one would require a long journey and is not beneficial unless you can get close.

### Option 2: Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — i.e., when there is less dirt.
- Cleaning dirt removes it and helps create conditions for apples to spawn in the future.

--- Step 28 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to determine the best course of action.

Current position: (7, 3)  
Agent 2 is at (7, 2) — directly above me, so they're in close proximity.  
There is dirt at (7, 4) — directly to my right, just one step away.  
Nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 steps away.  
The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 step away — very close and immediately actionable.

Now, evaluating the trade-offs:

1. **Eat an apple?**  
   The nearest apple is 6 steps away — not immediately reachable. I am not near any apple currently. Eating an apple would require movement to reach it, which would take time and energy. Since no apple is in immediate range (within 1 step), there is no immediate apple to eat. So, no immediate reward is possible right now.

2. **Clean the dirt at (7, 4)?**  
   This is a critical decision. Dirt must be cleaned to allow apples to spawn. The river is currently dirty (dirt at (7, 4)), which suppresses apple spawning. Cleaning it will improve
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision.

Current position: (7, 2)  
Agent 1 is at (7, 3) — directly above me, so we're in the same column.  
Nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 steps away — a reasonable distance.  
Nearest dirt is at (7, 4), which is just 1 step away (up from current position).  

Key point: Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning cleaning dirt is necessary to enable future apple spawning. However, cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward. Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately.  

But here's the trade-off:  
- If I eat an apple now, I gain 1 point immediately, but I'm not helping the group's long-term ability to spawn apples.  
- If I clean the dirt at (7,4), I'm investing in future apple availability — which benefits the group (including possibly myself later).  

However, the dirt is very close — only 1 step away. That makes cleaning dirt a low-effort, high-impact action.  

Also, the nearest apple is at (12,2), which is

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4), dirt at (6, 5) and dirt at (7, 6).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4), not eat an apple.

Reasoning:

- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Currently, there is dirt at (7, 4), (6, 5), and (7, 6). These dirt patches block apple spawning. Since apples are not currently spawning, the only way to enable them is to clean the dirt.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), which is just one step away from my current position (7, 5). This is the most efficient action — a single move to clean dirt and improve the environment.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 point, but there is no apple visible in the current field of view. The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 steps away — far beyond immediate reach. Even if we could eat it, it would require cleaning the dirt first to make the land viable for apple spawning.
- Cleaning dirt has no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning. This supports the group's long-term goals and increases the probability of future apple availability. Since apples are the only source of points, enabling their spawning is essential for maximizing total points.
- There is

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully and make a strategic decision based on the goals and constraints.

Current position: (7, 3)  
Agent 2 is at (7, 2) — directly above me, so close proximity.  
Dirt is at (7, 4) — directly to my right (east).  
Nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 steps away.  
The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 step away — very close.  

Now, let’s evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   - There’s no apple visible at (7, 3) or nearby. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 steps away.  
   - Eating an apple would require movement to reach it — not possible immediately.  
   - There is no apple in the immediate vicinity. So, no immediate apple can be eaten now.  
   → This option is not viable.

2. **Clean the dirt at (7, 4)?**  
   - This is a critical action. Dirt removal enables apple spawning on land.  
   - The dirt is only 1 step away —
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am at (7, 2), and I see Agent 1 at (7, 3) — directly above me. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away. That means I would need to move right 5 units to reach it. The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), which is just one step above me — distance 1 (not 2 as stated in the global scan, likely a typo). Cleaning dirt at (7, 4) would allow apples to spawn on land, which is essential for long-term rewards.

Now, evaluating the trade-offs:

1. **Eat an apple?**  
   The apple at (12, 2) is 5 steps away — not immediately accessible. Eating it would require movement, and there's no indication that an apple is currently visible or available nearby. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and we currently have dirt present, it's unlikely an apple is available now. So, eating an apple now would be futile — no apple is spawnable at this moment.

2. **Clean dirt?**  
   The dirt at (7,

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4), dirt at (6, 5) and dirt at (7, 6).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am at (7, 5).  
Visible dirt is at (7, 4), (6, 5), and (7, 6).  
The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away.  
The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), just 1 unit away — meaning it's immediately adjacent and accessible.

Now, the rules state:
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt).
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but enables future apple spawning.
- I can only move in cardinal directions (up, down, left, right), not diagonally.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.

So the trade-off is:
1. Eat an apple now — immediate +1.0 point, but only if there's an apple nearby.
2. Clean dirt — no immediate reward, but increases chances of future apples (especially since apples spawn only when the river is clean).

But — is there an apple *available* for me to eat right now?

Therefore, the optimal decision is to eat the apple at (

--- Step 29 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 5). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am currently at (6, 5). The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 4 units away — a reasonable distance. However, apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. The nearest dirt is at (7, 3), which is 3 units away from me. That means I can reach it in 3 moves (down to (7,4), then to (7,3)) — a short path.

Currently, there are no apples visible nearby, and I see nothing of interest. This suggests that the apple at (2,5) may not be spawnable right now because the river isn't clean. The rule says apples only spawn when the river is clean — so if the dirt is not cleaned, apples won’t appear, even if they are close.

Therefore:
- Eating an apple now would be impossible, because the apple at (2,5) is not spawnable — it's just "seen" but not available. There's no indication that an apple is currently present or accessible.
- Cleaning the dirt at (7,3) would enable future apple spawning. This is a necessary step to unlock the apple at (

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 2). You see dirt at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 3).

Reasoning:

- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Right now, there is dirt at (7, 3), which is blocking apple spawning. Even though the nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away, apples cannot spawn in dirt-covered areas. Without cleaning the dirt, no apples will appear in that region — meaning no immediate or future apple rewards are possible in that area.
- The dirt at (7, 3) is only 2 units away from my current position (6, 2), making it very accessible. Cleaning it is a low-effort, high-impact action that directly enables future apple spawning.
- Eating an apple now is not viable because there are no apples visible in the current environment. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is far away and likely blocked by dirt or not yet spawned.
- Cleaning dirt provides no immediate reward, but it is a necessary precondition for apples to appear. Since the goal is to maximize points over time, long-term sustainability (via apple spawning) is more valuable than short-term gains.
- There is no nearby area to explore that is both safe and un

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (12, 8). You see an apple at (13, 7) and an apple at (13, 8).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (13, 8).

Here's the reasoning:

- The apple at (13, 8) is directly adjacent (distance 1), meaning I can reach it in one move. This gives me an immediate +1.0 reward, which is valuable and straightforward.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 7), which is 6 units away. Cleaning it would require a significant journey and no immediate benefit — the apple spawning only happens when the river is clean, but there's no indication that cleaning this dirt will result in apples appearing *now* or in the near future. The global scan shows apples are already present, so the system may already be in a state where apple spawning is enabled.
- There’s no urgent need to clean dirt at this moment because apples are already available. Cleaning dirt provides no immediate reward and is a long-term investment that may not yield returns if no apples are spawning anyway.
- The trade-off between immediate reward and future potential is favorable here: I can gain a point right now without sacrificing progress. Delaying would mean forgoing that point, which could be critical in a scoring game.

Therefore, eating the apple at (13, 8) is the optimal choice — it

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (8, 4).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the trade-off carefully based on the current situation and long-term goals.

Currently, I am at (7, 5). The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away — a significant distance. The nearest dirt is at (7, 3), only 2 units away, meaning I can reach it quickly. There's also dirt at (8, 4), which is 1 unit away in the direction of (8, 4) — very close.

Key facts:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed).
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward but enables future apple spawning.
- I cannot move diagonally, so movement is constrained to cardinal directions.

Now, evaluating the options:

1. **Eat an apple immediately?**  
   The nearest apple is 5 units away — I’d have to walk there, which takes time and effort. Since I can't eat apples unless I're at them, and there's no apple currently in my vicinity, I cannot eat one now. So this option is not feasible at this moment.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see dirt at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 3).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away. To reach it, I would need to move through several tiles, potentially including the dirt at (7, 3). However, there is no immediate apple available at my current position (7, 2), and the only visible apple is far away.
- The dirt at (7, 3) is only 1 tile away — a very short distance. Cleaning it will improve the river's cleanliness, which increases the likelihood of apples spawning in the future. This is a necessary precondition for long-term apple availability.
- Eating an apple now would give a +1.0 reward, but there are no apples visible nearby. The nearest apple is far away and cannot spawn unless the river is clean. Therefore, eating an apple immediately would be ineffective — it would not lead to future apple generation or progress.
- Cleaning dirt has no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning. Since the nearest apple is 5 tiles away and currently not spawning due to dirt, cleaning the dirt is a prerequisite for accessing that apple in the future.
- The global scan shows that the dirt is very close

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (13, 8). You see an apple at (13, 7) and an apple at (13, 8).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (13, 8) for immediate reward.

Reasoning:

- The apple is at (13, 8), which is directly adjacent to my current position (13, 8), so I can reach it instantly with no movement cost.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately, which is a direct and tangible gain.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 7), which is 7 units away — a significant distance. Cleaning it would require multiple moves and no immediate reward. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), cleaning it is a long-term investment with no immediate benefit.
- There is already an apple at (13, 7) and one at (13, 8), meaning apples are currently spawning in this area. This suggests the river is already relatively clean in this region, so the immediate need to clean dirt is low.
- Since I can eat an apple without any risk or cost, and the future apple spawning is already occurring (due to existing apples), there is no urgent need to clean dirt now.

- So, I cannot

Currently, I'm at (7, 5). The observation shows dirt at (7, 4), (6, 5), and (7, 6). The global scan indicates that the nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away — quite far. The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), just one step away. 

Key rule: Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning. There is no immediate reward for cleaning dirt, but it's essential for future apple availability. Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately, but if the land remains dirty, apples won't spawn, and the group's long-term success is compromised.

Right now, there is no apple in immediate range. The nearest apple is 5 steps away, and to reach it, I’d have to clean dirt along the way — which requires movement and time. But since the dirt at (7, 4) is only one step away, I can clean it immediately. Cleaning it would make that patch of land eligible for future apple spawning, potentially enabling apples to appear

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here's my reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — quite far. Eating it immediately would give only +1.0 point, but it would not help the long-term goal of enabling future apple spawning.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 unit away — very close. Cleaning it is a low-effort, high-impact action that directly contributes to making the river clean, which increases the chance of apples spawning in the future.
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. So, cleaning dirt is not just a side task — it's a prerequisite for future apple generation. Without cleaning, even if we move toward apples, they won't appear.
- There is no immediate apple nearby that justifies eating one now. The current apple at (12, 2) is too far to be worth the effort without first ensuring the environment is conducive to apple spawning.
- Since I am Agent 1 and the goal is to maximize points *over time* (not just in the short term), and since cleaning dirt enables future apple spawns (which can be eaten later), this action is strategically
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am at (7, 2), and I see Agent 1 at (7, 3) — directly above me. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away. That means I can reach it, but it's not immediately accessible. The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), which is only 2 units away — directly above me. Cleaning this dirt would be a short, efficient action that enables future apple spawning.

Key trade-offs:

1. **Eating an apple for immediate reward**:  
   - An apple gives +1.0 point immediately.  
   - However, apples only spawn *when the river is clean*. Right now, the river is not clean (dirt exists), so no apples are spawning.  
   - Therefore, there is no apple available at this moment — I can't eat one unless I first clean the dirt to enable spawning.  
   - The apple at (12, 2) is not currently available because the river is dirty. So, I cannot eat it now.

2. **Cleaning dirt to enable future apple spawning**:  
   - Cleaning dirt is not rewarding immediately,
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4), dirt at (6, 5) and dirt at (7, 6).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to determine the best course of action.

Current position: (7, 5)  
Visible dirt: (7, 4), (6, 5), (7, 6)  
Nearest apple: (2, 5) — distance 5  
Nearest dirt: (7, 4) — distance 1  

Key considerations:

1. **Immediate reward vs. long-term benefit**:  
   - Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately.  
   - However, apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be removed.  
   - Right now, there is dirt at (7,4), which is just one step away.  
   - Since apples are not currently spawning (because dirt exists), eating an apple would be *impossible* unless the dirt is cleaned first.  
   - But wait — the observation says "you see dirt" at (7,4), (6,5), (7,6), and the nearest apple is at (2,5). This implies the apple is not currently available.  
   - Therefore, **no apple can be eaten at this moment** — the game mechanics require the river (or land) to be clean for

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away. That means it's not immediately accessible — we'd need to move through terrain to reach it, and currently, there's no apple spawning because the river is dirty.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 unit away from my current position (7, 3), so it's very close and easily reachable.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apple spawning. Without cleaning, even if I move toward the apple, I won't be able to eat it because no apples will appear.
- Eating an apple now is not possible because there are no apples visible in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is far away and only appears when the river is clean — so eating it is not feasible without first cleaning.
- Cleaning the dirt at (7, 4) will improve the river's cleanliness, enabling future apple spawning. This benefits the group by increasing the total available apple count over time.
- Since I cannot move diagonally, I can only go up/down/left/right — and (7, 4
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4), even though it offers no immediate reward.

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — a significant distance. There’s no apple in immediate range (within 1 or 2 steps), so eating an apple now would require a long path and high risk of missing the opportunity to clean dirt that enables future apple spawning.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 2 steps away — very close. Cleaning it would improve the river’s cleanliness, which directly increases the chance of apples spawning in the future. This is a necessary step to enable long-term apple availability.
- There is no immediate apple nearby to eat, and the apple at (12, 2) is too far to be worth the effort without first ensuring the river is clean. Without cleaning dirt, apples won’t spawn at all — so the action is not optional.
- The goal is to maximize points over time, not just immediate gains. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future rewards.

Therefore, the optimal strategy is to move to (7, 4), clean the dirt, and then proceed to

--- Step 29 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (1, 1). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 2 at (2, 0).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Here’s the reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only 1 step away — this is a direct, positive reward (+1.0 point) with no risk or delay.
- Agent 2 is at (2, 0), which is adjacent to the apple. If I don’t act now, that agent might eat the apple before me, especially since they are in a position to do so. Eating it now ensures I get the point and prevents a potential loss to another agent.
- The dirt at (8, 1) is far away (distance 7), and cleaning it would only enable future apple spawns. Since no apples are currently spawning (and we don’t have any information about apple spawning conditions beyond clean river), the long-term benefit of cleaning dirt is not immediate or certain.
- There is no indication that the group needs immediate coordination or that cleaning dirt is a shared priority. Without a clear directive or future apple spawn prediction, delaying action to clean dirt is a suboptimal use of time and movement.
- The rules state that apples only spawn when the river is clean — but that doesn’t mean they *will* spawn immediately or that cleaning is necessary for *now*. We

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 0). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 1 at (1, 1).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only 1 step away — this is a direct, positive action that gives me +1.0 point with no risk or delay.
- The nearest dirt is at (8, 1), which is 7 steps away — this is far from my current position and not immediately beneficial. Cleaning it would require significant movement and time, and since apples only spawn when the river is clean, the benefit (future apples) is delayed and uncertain.
- There is no immediate threat or urgent need to clean dirt. Agent 1 is at (1, 1), which is adjacent to the apple, but there’s no indication they are blocking access or that they are a threat — only a presence.
- The rule states that apples only spawn when the river is clean, meaning cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple spawning. However, since apples are already present (at (1,0)), and I can eat them now, I don’t need to delay action for future gains.
- In a cleanup game where immediate rewards are available and future rewards are conditional and distant, maximizing immediate points is a rational strategy — especially when no other immediate benefit (like clearing a path

Moving from (7, 3) towards (8, 3).
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see dirt at (8, 2).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (8, 2).

Here's the reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible in the immediate vicinity (the nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away), and we are at (7, 3). There’s no apple at (8, 2) — it's dirt. Eating an apple now would give +1.0 reward, but there is no apple to eat at the current location.
- The dirt at (8, 2) is directly adjacent and only 1 step away (moving right to (8, 3), then down to (8, 2) — but actually, from (7,3) to (8,2) is one diagonal move, which is not allowed). So, can we reach (8,2) without diagonal movement?

Let’s verify movement:  
From (7,3), valid moves are:
- Up: (6,3)
- Down: (8,3)
- Left: (6,3) — already listed
- Right: (8,3)

So (8,2) is not directly reachable — it's one step diagonally down-right from (7,3). Since diagonal movement

--- Step 30 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (1, 1). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 2 at (2, 0).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only 1 step away — this gives me a direct +1.0 reward with no risk or cost.
- The nearest dirt is at (8, 1), which is 7 steps away — cleaning it would take significant time and effort with no immediate benefit.
- There is no indication that cleaning dirt is urgent or that future apples depend on immediate action. Apple spawning is conditional on the river being clean, but that is a long-term, indirect effect.
- Agent 2 is at (2, 0), which is adjacent to the apple. If agent 2 eats it, they would gain the reward. Since I can move to (1, 0) and eat it before agent 2 does, I have a strategic advantage in claiming the immediate reward.
- In a cleanup game, while cleaning dirt is necessary for future apple spawning, it is not a priority when immediate, accessible rewards are available. The goal is to maximize points — and eating an apple gives a clear, immediate point.

Therefore, the trade-off favors immediate action: eat the apple. This maximizes short-term points and gives me a tangible reward without incurring any cost or

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 0). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 1 at (1, 1).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only 1 step away — this is a direct, low-effort opportunity for a +1.0 point reward. There is no risk or delay involved.
- The nearest dirt is at (8, 1), which is 7 steps away — far beyond immediate reach. Cleaning it would require significant movement and time, and there is no current indication that apples will spawn or become available in the near future without it.
- The presence of Agent 1 at (1, 1) does not pose a threat or obstruction; they are not blocking movement to the apple at (1, 0). I can move to (1, 0) safely and eat the apple.
- There is no immediate benefit to cleaning dirt at this stage — the game mechanics state that apples only spawn when the river is clean, but we have no evidence that the river is currently dirty or that apple spawning is delayed. The global scan shows the nearest apple is already present, so it's already possible to harvest.
- In a cleanup game, long-term strategy (like cleaning dirt) is important, but only when immediate rewards are unavailable or when the future state of the environment
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 1, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 3). You see dirt at (7, 2) and dirt at (8, 2).
  Thinking: I am at (8, 3). The current observation shows dirt at (7, 2) and (8, 2). The global scan indicates that the nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 steps away. The nearest dirt is at (8, 2), just 1 step away — meaning I can reach it immediately.

Let’s analyze the trade-offs:

1. **Should I eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple currently visible in my immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 steps away. Eating an apple would require moving to that location and then consuming it. Since there are no apples currently available at (8, 3), there’s no immediate apple to eat. So this option is not viable right now.

2. **Should I clean dirt to ensure future apples spawn?**  
   This is a critical point. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be removed. The dirt at (8, 2) is just one step away. Cleaning it would reduce dirt in that area, potentially enabling apple spawning in the future. Since the nearest apple is at (12,

2. **Clean dirt** — no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when there's less dirt), removing dirt increases the chance of apples appearing. This is a long-term strategy that benefits the group. The dirt at (8,1) is very close and accessible — cleaning it would

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (3, 5). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 5), even though it doesn't give immediate reward.

Here's why:

- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Right now, there is dirt at (6, 5), which is just 3 steps away. This dirt is blocking apple spawning in that area.
- The nearest apple is at (13, 6), which is 11 steps away — quite far. Without cleaning the dirt, that apple (and potentially others) may never spawn at all.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 point, but if the river remains dirty, no more apples will spawn, and future rewards are lost.
- Cleaning dirt is a necessary prerequisite for apple spawning. It's a long-term investment in enabling future rewards.
- There's no immediate alternative action with higher value. Moving to clean dirt is the only action that enables future apple growth.

Even though there's no apple visible nearby, the global scan shows that cleaning dirt at (6, 5) is the only way to enable the apple at (13, 6) to appear. Without it, the apple remains inaccessible.

Therefore, I should move to (6, 5) to clean the dirt

--- Step 30 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 5). You see agent 3 at (4, 5) and dirt at (6, 5).
  Thinking: I am at (6, 5), and I see dirt at the same location. This means the river is currently dirty at this point, which prevents apples from spawning. Apples only appear when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be removed. The nearest apple is at (13, 6), which is 8 units away — quite far. There is no apple in immediate proximity, so eating one now would give me +1.0 point, but it would not contribute to long-term progress.

However, the dirt at (6, 5) is directly where I am. Cleaning it would improve the river's cleanliness, enabling apples to spawn in the future — possibly at (13, 6) or nearby. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apple generation. Without cleaning, even if I walk to (13, 6), there will be no apples to eat.

Moreover, I am not alone — agent 3 is at (4, 5), which is adjacent to me. While I don’t know their intentions, cleaning dirt is a group benefit. If I clean this dirt, I am enabling future apple spawning, which benefits not just myself but the entire group. This align

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 0). You see dirt at (8, 1).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully.

I am at position (8, 0), and I see dirt at (8, 1) — just one step away. The nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 5 steps away. There are no apples currently visible or nearby, and the only dirt is at (8, 1).

Let’s break down the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There is no apple at (8, 0) or nearby. The nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 5 steps away. Eating an apple would require movement and time, and there’s no apple in immediate range. So, no immediate reward is available. This option is not viable.

2. **Clean the dirt at (8, 1)?**  
   → This is a strategic move. The rule states that apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt). So, cleaning dirt enables future apple spawning.  
   → Right now, there is dirt at (8, 1), which is blocking potential apple growth. By cleaning it, I’m making the environment more favorable for apples to appear in the future
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (4, 5). You see dirt at (6, 5) and agent 1 at (6, 5).
  Thinking: I am at (4, 5). The nearest dirt is at (6, 5), which is directly ahead and only 2 units away. There is already an agent (Agent 1) present at that location. This suggests that the dirt at (6, 5) is either already being cleaned or is a point of contention or activity.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   The nearest apple is at (13, 6), which is 10 units away — far out of reach in a single path. There are no apples visible in the immediate vicinity. Eating an apple would require moving to a location where one exists, and since none are nearby, this would be inefficient and not yield any immediate benefit. Moreover, apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned first. Without cleaning dirt, apples won’t appear. So, eating an apple now is not feasible or strategic.

2. **Clean the dirt at (6, 5) to enable future apple spawning?**  
   This is critical. Dirt must be cleaned to allow apples to spawn. The dirt at (6, 5) is the nearest and most accessible dirt, only 2 units

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 5). You see agent 3 at (5, 5).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully and make a strategic decision based on the game rules and current state.

Current position: (6, 5)  
Agent 3 is at (5, 5) — directly adjacent, so we're close to each other.  
Nearest apple: (13, 6), distance = 8 — quite far.  
Nearest dirt: (7, 7), distance = 3 — very close, just one step east and one step north.

Key points:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned). So, without cleaning dirt, apples won’t appear, even if we’re near them.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately — a direct reward.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but enables future apple spawning — which benefits the group and may lead to more long-term gains.
- We cannot move diagonally — movement is only horizontal or vertical.

Now, the trade-off:
- Option 1: Eat an apple at (13,6)? But we’re 8 units away — we can’t reach it without first cleaning dirt or moving through the terrain. And there’s no apple visible nearby. So, there’s no apple

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 1). You see dirt at (8, 1) and dirt at (8, 2).
  Thinking: I am at (8, 1), and I observe dirt at both (8, 1) and (8, 2). The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away. There is no apple currently visible in my immediate vicinity — the only things I see are dirt. 

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There is no apple at (8, 1) or (8, 2). I cannot eat an apple right now. So this option is not viable. The immediate reward is zero.  

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   → This is critical. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed). Since the dirt at (8, 1) and (8, 2) is blocking apple spawning, cleaning it is essential to enable apples to appear in those areas — especially since the nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is on a path that may require clean land to be accessible.  
   → Cleaning dirt has no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning, which directly supports the group's long-term goal.
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (5, 5). You see agent 1 at (6, 5).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the trade-off carefully.

Currently, I am at (5,5), and the nearest apple is at (13,6), which is 9 units away. That’s a long distance — I would need to move significantly to reach it. There’s no apple in immediate range. 

The nearest dirt is at (7,7), which is only 2 units away (distance = √((7-5)² + (7-5)²) = √8 ≈ 2.83). That’s very close. Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apples to spawn, and since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), cleaning this dirt will eventually allow apples to appear — possibly even at (13,6) or nearby.

However, eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately, which is a direct reward. But there are no apples visible nearby. The apple at (13,6) is far away, and I have no information about whether it will spawn or be accessible without first cleaning the dirt.

Key considerations:
- I cannot eat any apple right now because there is no apple in my immediate vicinity.
- Moving diagonally is not allowed, so I must move either north/south or east/west. From (7,4

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 0). You see dirt at (8, 0).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to determine the best course of action.

Current position: (6, 0)  
Dirt at: (8, 0) — only 2 units away  
Nearest apple: at (13, 0) — 7 units away  
Immediate reward: eating an apple gives +1.0 point  
Cleaning dirt: no immediate reward, but enables future apple spawning

Key observations:
- There are no apples currently visible nearby. The nearest apple is 7 units away, and it's on land — but land only spawns apples when the river is clean.
- There is dirt at (8, 0), which is just 2 units away from my current position. This means I can reach it quickly.
- Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is removed), cleaning this dirt will eventually allow apples to spawn — potentially at (13, 0) or elsewhere downstream.
- Eating an apple now would give a +1.0 reward, but there are no apples in the immediate vicinity. The apple at (13, 0) is far away and currently blocked by dirt — meaning it won't spawn until the river is clean.

Trade-off:

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 4). You see dirt at (7, 5) and agent 3 at (7, 5).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully.

Currently, I am at (7, 4). There is dirt at (7, 5), and Agent 3 is also at that location. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 7 units away — quite far. The nearest dirt is only 1 unit away, meaning it's immediately accessible.

Now, let's consider the options:

1. **Eating an apple**: There are no apples visible in my current vicinity. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is far away and would require significant movement. Since I'm not in a position to eat an apple right now, this option doesn't provide immediate reward.

2. **Cleaning dirt to enable future apple spawning**: The dirt at (7, 5) is directly adjacent to me and is the closest dirt to my current position. Cleaning it would improve the river's cleanliness, which increases the chance of apples spawning in that area. This is a long-term benefit for the group. Moreover, since Agent 3 is already at (7, 5), they might be trying to clean it too — but if they are not cleaning, it's a missed opportunity for the group.

3. **Expl

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see agent 2 at (7, 4) and dirt at (7, 5).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 5), directly adjacent to dirt at (7, 5), and I see Agent 2 at (7, 4). The nearest apple is at (13, 6), which is 7 units away — quite far. There is no apple currently visible in my vicinity, and the only spawn condition for apples is when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is removed). 

Right now, there is dirt at (7, 5), which is my current position. This means the river is not clean here — apples cannot spawn. So, *eating an apple is not possible right now*, because no apples are available due to the presence of dirt.

Therefore, **option 1 (eating an apple)** is invalid — no apple is present to eat.

**Option 2 (cleaning dirt)** is both necessary and beneficial. Removing dirt at (7, 5) will make the river clean at that point, which increases the chance of apples spawning in the future — especially since the nearest apple is at (13, 6), which is downstream or in a reachable zone. Cleaning dirt enables future apple spawns, which benefits the group. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, this action is

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 0). You see dirt at (8, 0) and dirt at (6, 1).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am at position (7, 0).  
I see dirt at (8, 0) and (6, 1).  
The nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 6 steps away.  
The nearest dirt is at (8, 0), just 1 step away — that's very close.  

Right now, there are no apples visible nearby, and the only dirt is at (8,0) and (6,1). Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), cleaning dirt is essential to enable future apple spawning.  

**Option 1: Eat an apple**  
There is no apple in immediate reach. The nearest apple is 6 steps away, and there's no indication that any apple is currently spawning. Eating an apple now would require moving to (13,0), which is far and not immediately beneficial. Also, since apples only spawn when dirt is cleaned, and we currently have no cleanable area with apples nearby, there’s no apple to eat right now. So this option is not viable.

**Option 2: Clean dirt to enable future apples**  
The

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 4). You see dirt at (6, 3) and agent 3 at (7, 5).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 3).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 7 units away — quite far. Given that apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and there is currently dirt at (6, 3) just 2 units away, it's not feasible to reach the apple directly without first cleaning the dirt.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 point, but it would require moving to a location where an apple is already present — which is not currently accessible due to the dirt blocking apple spawning.
- The dirt at (6, 3) is the nearest dirt, and cleaning it would allow apples to spawn in the future. This directly supports the group's long-term goal of increasing apple availability.
- Since the agent is at (7, 4), moving to (6, 3) is a single step west (valid move), and cleaning it would be a necessary step toward enabling future apple spawning.
- There are no immediate apples in the vicinity that can be eaten without first cleaning the dirt. Therefore, eating an apple now would be both inefficient and counterproductive — it would miss the opportunity to

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see agent 2 at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to make the best decision as Agent 3.

Current position: (7, 5)  
Agent 2 is at (7, 4) — directly above me, so we're in the same column.  
Nearest apple is at (13, 6), which is 7 units away (distance = |13–7| + |6–5| = 6 + 1 = 7).  
Nearest dirt is at (7, 7), which is only 2 units away (same column, one step up).  

Now, evaluating the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   - The nearest apple is 7 units away — quite far.  
   - There is no apple visible nearby (within 1 or 2 steps).  
   - Eating an apple would give +1.0 point, but only if one is available and accessible.  
   - Since no apple is in immediate range, and the apple is far away, this option is not viable *now*.  

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   - Dirt at (7, 7) is only 2 steps away — very accessible.

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 0). You see dirt at (8, 0) and dirt at (6, 1).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision.

Current position: (8, 0)  
Observed dirt: at (8, 0) and (6, 1)  
Nearest apple: at (13, 0), distance = 5  
Nearest dirt: at (8, 0), distance = 0  

Key facts:
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. That means dirt must be cleaned before apples can appear.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning — which is crucial for long-term point accumulation.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately, but if we don’t clean dirt, apples won’t spawn in the future, and the group will lose potential rewards.

Right now, there is dirt at (8, 0) — my current location — and at (6, 1). That means the river is not clean, so no apples are currently spawning. Even though the nearest apple is at (13, 0), it’s not spawning because the river is dirty.

Important trade-off:
- Eating the apple gives me +1.0 point immediately — a clear, tangible reward with no risk

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 3). You see dirt at (7, 2) and agent 2 at (8, 4).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

Current position: (8, 3)  
Visible dirt: (7, 2) — distance = 1 step (southwest)  
Agent 2 is at (8, 4) — directly above me  
Nearest apple: (12, 2) — distance = 5 steps (east then south)  
Nearest dirt: (7, 2) — distance = 2 steps (from (8,3) to (7,2) is 1 step west and 1 step south = √2, but Manhattan distance is 2)

Important rule: Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward but enables future apple spawning. So, cleaning dirt is a long-term investment.

Now, evaluating the options:

1. **Eat an apple immediately?**  
   The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 steps away. That’s far, and we have no apple in immediate range. There's no apple visible at (8,3) or nearby. So, no immediate apple to eat. This option is not viable.

2. **Clean the dirt at (

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 4). You see agent 1 at (8, 3) and dirt at (8, 5).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to make the best decision for maximizing points and contributing to the group's success.

Currently, I am at (8, 4). Agent 1 is at (8, 3), directly above me, and there is dirt at (8, 5), directly to my right. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — a significant distance. The nearest dirt is only 1 unit away (at (8, 5)), meaning it's very close and accessible.

Let’s break down the options:

1. **Eat an apple** — There is no apple visible in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is far away (distance 6), and no apple is currently spawning because the river is not clean. Eating an apple would require being at a location with an apple, which isn't currently available. Therefore, **no immediate apple can be eaten**. This option is not viable.

2. **Clean the dirt at (8, 5)** — This is a critical action. Dirt removal is not rewarding in itself, but it enables apples to spawn on land when the river is clean. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 5}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (1, 1). You see an apple at (1, 0).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only 1 step away — this is a direct, positive reward (+1.0 point) with no risk or cost.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 0), which is 7 steps away. Cleaning it would require a significant journey with no immediate benefit. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and we don’t currently have any apples spawning (only one at (1,0) already), the future spawning of apples depends on cleaning dirt, which is far away and not currently relevant to our immediate situation.
- There is no indication that cleaning dirt will yield any apples in the short term, and the current apple is already present and accessible.
- The trade-off between immediate reward and future benefit is heavily skewed: eating the apple gives us a clear, tangible point now, while cleaning dirt offers no immediate benefit and requires a long, inefficient journey.
- Since we are in a cleanup game where the goal is to maximize points, and apples give +1.0 each, it is rational to prioritize immediate gains when they are available and achievable.

Therefore, the optimal action is to eat the apple at (1, 0) now

--- Step 31 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see dirt at (7, 2).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 2).

Here's the reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible in immediate range. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — far enough that it's not practical to eat it now without first ensuring the river is clean.
- The dirt at (7, 2) is directly adjacent to my current position (7, 3), making it the closest and most accessible dirt patch.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple generation. Without cleaning, no apples will appear, regardless of how far away they are.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 point, but it's not possible to spawn any apples in the current state. Thus, this action would be futile and waste a valuable opportunity to enable future rewards.
- Cleaning dirt provides no immediate reward, but it is essential for enabling future apple spawning. This aligns with the long-term goal of maximizing points through sustainable progress.
- Since I cannot move diagonally, the only practical path is to move to (7, 2) and clean it. This is a minimal, efficient action with high strategic value.

Therefore, the optimal
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 2}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 5). You see dirt at (8, 5).
  Thinking: I am at (8, 5), and I see dirt at that exact location. The nearest apple is at (13, 6), which is 6 steps away. There is currently no apple nearby — the only food source is distant. 

Let’s analyze the trade-off:

1. **Eat an apple?**  
   There is no apple at (8, 5). I cannot eat an apple here. Eating requires being on a land tile with an apple. Since no apple is present and the nearest apple is 6 steps away, I cannot gain immediate reward by eating now.

2. **Clean the dirt?**  
   Yes — cleaning dirt is essential. Dirt prevents apples from spawning. The rule states: *Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (less dirt = more apples)*.  
   Currently, the dirt is at (8, 5), which is my current position. If I clean it, I remove a dirt tile and potentially enable apple spawning in the future — especially since the nearest apple is at (13, 6), which is in a reachable zone.  
   Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it's a necessary step to enable future apple generation. Since apples are not spawning now
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 5}} -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (1, 0). You see an apple at (1, 0).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Reasoning:

- The apple is at my current position (1, 0), so I can immediately access it with no movement cost. This gives me a direct +1.0 reward with zero risk or delay.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 0), which is 6 units away. Cleaning dirt requires movement and time, and there is no immediate reward for cleaning. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is reduced), cleaning is a long-term investment with no short-term benefit.
- There is no indication that future apples will spawn unless dirt is cleaned — but since the apple is already present and accessible, acting now maximizes immediate points.
- The goal is to *maximize points*, and eating an apple directly achieves that. Delaying action to clean dirt would mean forgoing this immediate reward in favor of a future, uncertain benefit.

Therefore, the optimal decision is to eat the apple at (1, 0) — it is both accessible and immediately beneficial. Cleaning dirt can be considered later if and when future apples become unavailable or if the group's strategy requires it. In this situation, the immediate reward outweighs the speculative future benefit.
- This is a short-term

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4), dirt at (6, 5) and dirt at (7, 6).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to make the best decision as Agent 3.

Current position: (7, 5)  
Visible dirt: (7, 4), (6, 5), (7, 6)  
Nearest apple: (2, 5), distance 5  
Nearest dirt: (7, 4), distance 1  

Immediate options:
- Eat an apple at (2, 5)? → Distance is 5, which is far. To reach it, I'd need to move through potentially dirty areas. There's no apple visible in immediate vicinity — the nearest is 5 steps away, and I don’t have a clear path without encountering dirt.
- Clean dirt: (7,4), (6,5), (7,6) are all adjacent and within reach. Cleaning dirt has no immediate reward, but it's essential for enabling apple spawning in the future. The river is currently dirty, so apples won't spawn. By cleaning dirt, I’m directly contributing to making the environment fertile again.

Key insight:  
Apples only spawn when the river is clean. Since the river is currently dirty (as shown by dirt at (7,4), (6,5), (7,6

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully and make a strategic decision based on the game rules and current state.

Current position: (7, 3)  
Agent 2 is at (7, 2) — directly above me, so we're in the same column.  
Dirt is at (7, 4) — directly to my right.  
Nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 steps away.  
The nearest dirt is only 1 step away — very close.

Key rules:
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned).
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but enables future apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.
- You cannot move diagonally — so movement is strictly cardinal (up, down, left, right).

Now, evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple immediately?**  
   The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 steps away. I am currently at (7, 3). To reach (12, 2), I'd need to move right 5 and down 1 (or up/down to adjust). That's a significant distance

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to determine the best course of action.

Current position: (7, 2)  
Agent 1 is at (7, 3) — directly above me, so we're in the same column.  
Nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away horizontally.  
Nearest dirt is at (7, 4), just one step up — distance 2.

Key facts:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is removed).
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward but enables future apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.
- I cannot move diagonally — so movement is restricted to cardinal directions.

Now, evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple at (12, 2)?**  
   - Distance is 5 — that's far. I would need to walk 5 steps to reach it.  
   - No apple is visible or accessible immediately.  
   - Since apples only spawn when dirt is cleaned, and the nearest dirt is at (7,4), I must first consider whether cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apples to appear in the future.  
   - Eating an apple now

Current position: (7, 5)  
Dirt locations nearby: (7, 4), (6, 5), (7, 6)  
Nearest apple: (2, 5), distance = 5  
Nearest dirt: (7, 4), distance = 1  

Key points:

- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. This means dirt must be removed to enable apples to appear.  
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately, but only if an apple is present.  
- There is no apple visible at (7, 5) or nearby — the nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 steps away.  
- Dirt is present at (7, 4), (6, 5), and (7, 6). The closest dirt is at (7, 4), just one step away.  
- Since apples don’t spawn unless the river is clean, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple spawns.  
- There is no immediate apple available for consumption at the current location.

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here’s the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — quite far. There are no apples currently visible in the immediate vicinity (only dirt at (7,4)), so eating an apple now would not provide immediate value or strategic advantage.
- The dirt at (7,4) is only 1 unit away — very close. Cleaning it is a low-effort, high-impact action that directly contributes to improving the environment for future apple spawning.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when there is less dirt). By removing dirt, I enable the possibility of apples appearing in that area or nearby, which benefits the group (and potentially me later).
- There is no immediate reward for eating an apple in this situation — no apple is nearby, and the global scan shows no apples in the immediate range. Therefore, spending a move to clean dirt is more strategic than eating nothing.
- Moving diagonally is not allowed, so I must move in cardinal directions. From (7,3), I can move to (7,4) to clean the dirt — a valid, simple action.

Thus, cleaning the dirt

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the trade-off between immediate reward and long-term benefit.

Currently, I am at (7, 2), and I see Agent 1 at (7, 3). The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — that's a significant distance. The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), which is only 2 units away. This dirt is directly in front of me, on the same column (y=4), so it's very accessible.

Here’s the key insight: apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning. Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawns, which benefits the group. Since apples are the only source of points, and we are trying to maximize points (with the goal of eating apples), we must consider whether to act now or delay.

Option 1: Eat an apple immediately  
- There is no apple nearby. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 steps away.  
- I cannot eat an apple without moving there first.  
- So, eating an apple is not possible right now.  

Option 2: Clean the dirt at (

Agent 3 (High-Level):

Current position: (7, 5)  
Visible dirt: (7, 4), (6, 5), (7, 6)  
Nearest apple: (2, 5), distance = 5  
Nearest dirt: (7, 4), distance = 1  

Key observations:
- There are **no apples currently visible** at my position or nearby. The nearest apple is 5 units away — far from immediate reach.
- There is **dirt at (7,4)**, which is only 1 step away — very close.
- Cleaning dirt is **necessary** to enable apples to spawn on land. Without cleaning dirt, apples won't appear, even if they're in the global scan.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately, but **apples only spawn when the river is clean** — meaning if we don’t clean dirt, there will be no apples to eat in the future.
- Since the nearest apple is 5 steps away and no apples are visible in the immediate vicinity, **it is not possible to eat an apple now** without first cleaning dirt to allow apple spawning.

Therefore, maximizing immediate points is the optimal choice. Eating the apple at (13, 8) gives

Agent 1 (High-Level):

Here's the reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible in immediate proximity (the nearest apple is at (2, 5), 6 units away), and I am not in a position to eat one right now. Eating an apple is not immediately possible or beneficial without first enabling apple spawning.
- The dirt at (8, 4) is directly adjacent to my current position (8, 5), making it the closest and most accessible dirt to clean. Cleaning it will improve the river's cleanliness, which increases the chance of apples spawning in the future — especially since apples only spawn when the river is clean.
- While eating an apple gives a +1.0 immediate reward, there are no apples available to eat right now. The apple at (2, 5) is too far away to reach without a clear path and without first improving the environment to support apple spawning.
- Cleaning dirt does not give immediate reward, but it is a necessary precondition for apple spawning. This action supports long-term goal achievement and benefits the group by enabling future apple generation.
- Since I can move only in cardinal directions (up, down, left, right), and (8, 4) is directly below me
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see dirt at (7, 3) and dirt at (8, 4).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 3), where there is dirt. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 steps away — quite distant. The nearest dirt is at (7, 3), where I currently am. This means I am already standing on dirt, and there's also dirt at (8, 4), which is adjacent.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple visible at (7, 3) or (8, 4). The nearest apple is at (12, 2), far away. Eating an apple would require moving to it — which is not immediate. Since no apple is currently accessible, I cannot eat one right now. So this option is not viable.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   This is critical. Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning less dirt. Dirt must be cleaned to allow apples to appear. Currently, I am on dirt at (7, 3), and there's dirt at (8, 4). Cleaning these spots will reduce the dirt level and increase the chance of apples spawning later.  
   Since the nearest apple is
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 3}} -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (13, 8). You see an apple at (13, 7).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (13, 7).

Here's the reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only one step away — distance 1. This means I can gain +1.0 point with no risk or cost.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 7), which is 7 units away. Cleaning it would require significant movement and time, and there’s no immediate benefit from doing so — apples don’t spawn until the river is clean, and the current global scan shows only one apple exists, which is already accessible.
- There is no indication that future apples are likely to spawn soon or that the dirt at (7, 7) is critical to the current situation. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and we don’t know the current state of the river, cleaning dirt is a long-term, speculative action with no immediate payoff.
- In a cleanup game, the goal is to maximize points. Eating an apple gives immediate +1.0, which directly contributes to score. Delaying this for a potentially uncertain future benefit (future apples) is suboptimal if the apple is already within reach.

Therefore, the immediate reward outweighs the speculative benefit of cleaning dirt. I should eat the apple at (

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 4). You see agent 2 at (7, 3) and dirt at (8, 4).
  Thinking: I am at (8, 4), and I see dirt at the same location. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away. There's no apple currently visible in my immediate vicinity — only dirt. 

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There is no apple at (8, 4). I cannot eat an apple here. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is far away and requires movement. So, eating an apple is not immediately available. This option is not viable now.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   → The dirt at (8, 4) is right where I am. Cleaning it would improve the river's cleanliness, which increases the chance of apples spawning in the future. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, this action is essential for long-term apple availability.  
   → Even though cleaning gives no immediate reward, it is a prerequisite for apple generation. This action directly supports the group’s goal and enables future rewards.

3. **Where should I explore if nothing is nearby?**  
   → The nearest apple is at (12, 2
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see dirt at (8, 4) and agent 1 at (8, 4).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 3), and I observe that there is dirt at (8, 4), which is also where Agent 1 is currently located. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 steps away — a considerable distance. The nearest dirt is only 2 steps away, meaning it's very close and accessible.

Let’s analyze the trade-offs:

1. **Should I eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There are no apples visible in my immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is far away and requires a path through potentially dirty or uncleaned areas. Since no apple is currently spawnable (apples only spawn when the river is clean), eating one is not possible right now. So, **eating an apple is not an option** at this moment.

2. **Should I clean the dirt at (8, 4) to enable future apple spawning?**  
   Yes — and this is critical. Dirt removal is the only way to enable apples to spawn. The dirt is at (8, 4), which is only 1 step east from my current position (7, 3). I can move to (8, 3
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (13, 7). You see an apple at (13, 6) and an apple at (13, 7).
  Thinking: I am at (13, 7), and I see apples directly at (13, 7) and (13, 6). The nearest apple is at distance 0 — meaning I am already standing on an apple. This gives me immediate access to a reward of +1.0.

However, the global scan shows that the nearest dirt is at (7, 7), which is 6 units away. Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable future apple spawning — but it provides no immediate reward. The trade-off is clear:

- **Option 1 (Eat apple now):** Immediate +1.0 point. I am already on an apple, so this is a simple, safe, and rewarding action. No risk involved.
- **Option 2 (Clean dirt):** Requires moving to (7, 7) or nearby, which is 6 steps away. This would take time and effort with no immediate benefit. Moreover, since apples are already spawning (we have apples at (13,7) and (13,6)), the system is already in a state where apples are present — suggesting the river is already clean enough or the dirt has been cleaned previously.

Since apples are already visible and accessible, and the dirt is

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to determine the best course of action.

Current position: (7, 3)  
Agent 2 is at (7, 2) — directly above me, so they are in close proximity.  
There is dirt at (7, 4) — directly to my right, just one step away.  
Nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 steps away.  
The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 step away — very close.  

Now, let's evaluate the trade-offs:

1. **Eat an apple?**  
   The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 steps away. There are no apples visible in my immediate vicinity (at (7, 3), (7, 2), or (7, 4)). Eating an apple would require moving to a location where one exists. Since the nearest apple is far away and not currently accessible, I cannot eat an apple immediately. Therefore, this option is not viable right now.

2. **Clean the dirt at (7, 4)?**  
   This is a high-priority action. Dirt removal is necessary to enable apple spawning. The river

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision for maximizing points and contributing to the group's success.

Currently, I am at (7, 2), and I see Agent 1 at (7, 3). The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — a moderate distance. The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), which is only 2 units away. This is critical because apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning.

Now, let’s evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple immediately**  
   - Immediate reward: +1.0 point.  
   - However, the apple at (12, 2) is 5 steps away, and I would need to move there.  
   - The path from (7, 2) to (12, 2) is along the x-axis — a straight line.  
   - But if I eat the apple, I consume a resource (apple), and I still have dirt at (7, 4) that needs cleaning to allow future apple spawning.  
   - Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, cleaning dirt is a
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4), dirt at (6, 5) and dirt at (7, 6).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully and make a strategic decision based on the rules and goals.

Current position: (7, 5)  
Visible dirt: (7, 4), (6, 5), (7, 6)  
Nearest apple: (2, 5) — distance 5  
Nearest dirt: (7, 4) — distance 1  

Rule reminder:  
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned).  
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but enables future apple spawning.  
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.  
- Movement is only allowed orthogonally (up, down, left, right).  
- Goal is to maximize points — both immediate and long-term.

Now, evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple at (2, 5)?**  
   - Distance is 5 — that's far.  
   - The path to (2, 5) would require moving through potentially dirty areas.  
   - There’s no apple nearby (within 1 or 2 units) — the nearest is 5 units away.  
   - Eating an apple now would give a

--- Step 31 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here's my reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — far enough that immediate consumption is not feasible.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 unit away from my current position (7, 3), making it extremely accessible.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning. This is a critical prerequisite for future rewards.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 point, but there are no apples nearby to eat. Since I'm at (7, 3), and there's no apple in sight, I cannot eat one immediately.
- Cleaning the dirt at (7, 4) is a strategic, long-term move that enables future apple spawning. Even though it gives no immediate reward, it directly contributes to the group's ability to collect apples later.
- The trade-off between immediate reward and future potential is heavily skewed in favor of cleaning dirt: without cleaning, apples will not spawn, and the group will be unable to gain points. This action supports the collective goal.

Therefore, the
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the trade-off between immediate reward and long-term group benefit.

Currently, I am at (7, 2), and I see Agent 1 at (7, 3) — they are directly adjacent, which suggests potential coordination or competition. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — a moderate distance. The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), just one step above me — a very close and accessible target.

Key facts:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is removed).
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but enables future apple spawning.
- I can only move in cardinal directions (up, down, left, right), no diagonals.
- The immediate reward for eating an apple is +1.0, which is straightforward and valuable.
- However, if I clean the dirt at (7,4), I remove a dirt block that prevents apple spawning. This action is critical for enabling apples to appear in the future — especially since the nearest apple is at (12,2), which is downstream and likely on a path that depends on clean river segments.

Now, consider the trade-off:
- **Option 1: Eat
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4), dirt at (6, 5) and dirt at (7, 6).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the trade-off between immediate reward and long-term benefits.

Currently, I'm at (7, 5). The observation shows dirt at (7, 4), (6, 5), and (7, 6). The global scan indicates the nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away — quite far. The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), just 1 unit away. That means I can reach a dirt patch immediately.

Now, evaluating the options:

1. **Eat an apple**: There is no apple visible in my immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (2,5), which is 5 steps away. Since I'm not currently on land with an apple, I cannot eat one right now. So this option is not feasible immediately.

2. **Clean dirt**: This is critical. Dirt blocks apple spawning. The river is only clean when dirt is reduced. By cleaning dirt, I enable future apple spawning — which benefits the group. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, removing dirt is a prerequisite for apple growth. The dirt at (7,4) is adjacent — the closest possible target. Cleaning it would reduce the dirt load and increase the chance of

  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here's my reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — quite far. Eating it would give +1.0 immediately, but the apple only spawns when the river is clean. Since there is dirt at (7, 4), the river is currently dirty, and apples are not spawning.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 unit away from my current position (7, 3). That means I can reach it in one move.
- Cleaning dirt has no immediate reward, but it's essential for enabling apple spawning. Without cleaning, no apples will appear, regardless of how far I go.
- If I eat an apple now, I get a +1.0 reward, but that apple would not exist in the first place — it's not spawning due to the dirty river. So, the apple is not available to me right now.
- Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and the dirt is immediately accessible, cleaning it is a necessary prerequisite for any future apple collection.
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4), dirt at (6, 5) and dirt at (7, 6).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am at position (7, 5).  
I observe dirt at (7, 4), (6, 5), and (7, 6).  
The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away.  
The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), only 1 unit away — very close.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward**:  
   The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 steps away. To reach it, I’d need to move left to (6,5), then (5,5), (4,5), (3,5), (2,5). But there's dirt at (6,5) and (7,4), (7,6), which may block movement or require cleaning. Also, apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be removed to enable apple spawning. If I don't clean dirt, apples won't appear, and I can't get them. So, eating an apple now is not possible unless it's already spawned — and we don’t see one at my current

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here's the reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — far beyond immediate reach.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 unit away from my current position (7, 3), making it extremely accessible.
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple generation. Without cleaning, no apples will appear, even if we wait.
- Eating an apple now would give a +1.0 reward, but there are no apples nearby. The apple at (12, 2) is too far to reach immediately, and without cleaning dirt, it may never spawn at all.
- Cleaning dirt provides no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning — which benefits both the group and long-term strategy.
- Since agent 2 is at (7, 2), directly above me, and there's no indication of conflict or cooperation, there's no reason to avoid cleaning — it's a necessary step for future apple access.

Therefore, the optimal action is to clean the dirt at (7,
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to decide the best course of action.

Current position: (7, 2)  
Agent 1 is at (7, 3) — directly above me, so we're in close proximity.  
Nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — that’s a significant distance.  
Nearest dirt is at (7, 4), just one step above me — distance 1 (not 2 as listed in the global scan, likely a typo).  

Key insight: Apples only spawn when the river is clean. Dirt cleaning enables apple spawning. Right now, there's dirt at (7, 4), which is immediately adjacent. Cleaning it would make apples possible in that area — and since the nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is on the same row, cleaning dirt might help open up apple spawning in that region.

But here's the trade-off:

- Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately — a clear reward.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward but is necessary for future apple spawning — a long-term investment.

Now, is there an apple nearby? The nearest apple is 5 units away — no apple is within 1

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4), dirt at (6, 5) and dirt at (7, 6).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4) — not eat an apple immediately, and not explore randomly.

Here’s the reasoning:

- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Right now, there is dirt at (7, 4), (6, 5), and (7, 6). These dirt spots are blocking apple spawning. The presence of dirt directly prevents apples from appearing in those areas.
- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away — quite far. There’s no indication that apples are currently spawning anywhere, so eating one now would be a waste of time and energy.
- Cleaning dirt is not immediately rewarding, but it enables future apple spawning. Since apples are the only source of points, and they only appear when the river is clean, cleaning dirt is a necessary prerequisite to gaining apples.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 unit away — the closest dirt spot. Cleaning it would be the most efficient first step. It's a small, low-effort action with high long-term payoff.
- Moving to (6, 5) or (7, 6) would also require cleaning, but those are farther from the current position and

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — quite far, and currently no apples are spawning because the river is dirty.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 unit away from my current position (7, 3), making it immediately accessible.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apple generation. Without cleaning, even if I move toward the apple, there will be no apples to eat.
- Eating an apple now is not feasible because there are no apples visible in the immediate vicinity, and the global scan confirms apples are far away and depend on clean river conditions.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning — which directly supports the group's goal of maximizing points through apple consumption.
- Since I cannot move diagonally, moving to (7, 4) is a simple, direct action (one step right), and it is the only viable step that advances the long-term objective.

Therefore, the optimal action is to clean the dirt at (7, 4). This action ensures that apples can eventually spawn, making future apple collection

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the trade-off between immediate reward and long-term group benefit.

Currently, I am at (7, 2), and I see Agent 1 at (7, 3). The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 steps away. The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), just one step away — a very short distance. This dirt is directly in front of me, and cleaning it would make apples possible in the future.

Now, evaluating the options:

1. **Eat an apple immediately**: The nearest apple is 5 steps away, and I would have to move to (12, 2). There's no apple available at my current position (7, 2). So, eating an apple is not possible right now. Therefore, this option is not viable.

2. **Clean the dirt at (7, 4)**: This is only 1 step away. Cleaning dirt has no immediate reward, but it's essential for enabling apple spawning. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt), removing dirt at (7, 4) will improve the environment for future apple generation. This action supports the group's long-term goal.

3.

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4), dirt at (6, 5) and dirt at (7, 6).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision.

Currently, I am at (7, 5). I observe dirt at (7, 4), (6, 5), and (7, 6). The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 steps away. The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), just one step away — meaning I can reach it immediately.

Key point: Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Dirt removal is necessary to enable apple spawning. However, cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward — it's a prerequisite for future apple generation. Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately, which is valuable for scoring.

But here's the trade-off:
- If I eat an apple now, I gain +1.0 immediately, but I'm not cleaning dirt — so I'm not helping the group enable future apple spawns.
- If I clean dirt, I delay immediate reward but improve the environment for future apple spawning, which benefits the group and may allow more apples to appear later — potentially leading to more points over time.

However, I must consider proximity and feasibility:

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see agent 3 at (6, 5).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision.

Currently, I am at (7, 5), and I see Agent 3 at (6, 5) — directly to my left. The nearest apple is at (13, 6), which is 7 units away. That’s a long distance, and given that apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), I must consider whether there’s a nearby dirt patch that I can clean to enable future apple spawning.

The nearest dirt is at (7, 7), which is only 2 units away — directly above me. That’s very close. Cleaning dirt at (7, 7) would contribute to making the river cleaner, which increases the chance of apples spawning in the future — especially since apples are currently not spawning due to dirt. This is a key point: **apples don’t spawn on land when the river is dirty**. So, without cleaning dirt, no apples will appear, even if I'm close to one.

Therefore, **eating an apple now is not possible**, because there are no apples currently spawning — the nearest apple is far away, and the spawning condition (clean river) is not met. The apple at
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 7}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 1). You see dirt at (8, 2).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (8, 2).

Here’s my reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away. To reach it, I’d need to move through (9,2), (10,2), (11,2), (12,2). However, the dirt at (8,2) is directly adjacent and only 1 unit away. 
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be removed to enable apple spawning. If I don’t clean this dirt, future apple generation (including the one at (12,2)) will be blocked or delayed.
- Eating an apple now would give me +1.0 point, but it’s not a viable option because no apple is currently visible or accessible without first clearing the dirt blocking the path to the main apple location.
- There is no immediate apple in range that can be eaten without first cleaning the dirt. The apple at (12,2) is not currently spawning because the river (or land) is contaminated at (8,2).
- Cleaning the dirt at (8,2) is a necessary precondition for apple spawning — it’s a foundational action that enables
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 2}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 5). You see agent 1 at (7, 5).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the current situation and make a strategic decision based on the game rules and objectives.

Currently, I am at (6, 5), and I see Agent 1 at (7, 5) — directly adjacent to me, suggesting potential coordination or competition. The nearest apple is at (13, 6), which is 8 steps away — quite far. The nearest dirt is at (7, 7), which is only 3 steps away from me. That’s a critical point: dirt cleaning is necessary to enable apple spawning, and since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt), cleaning dirt directly enables future apple availability.

Let’s evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple now?**  
   There is no apple in immediate proximity. The nearest apple is 8 steps away, and I have no information about apples spawning in my immediate vicinity. Eating an apple would require movement to reach it, and with no apple visible nearby, this would be inefficient. Moreover, since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and the dirt is nearby, there may be no apple to eat *right now* — the spawning condition isn't met yet. So, eating an apple immediately is not feasible

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 6). You see agent 3 at (7, 5) and dirt at (7, 7).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to determine the best course of action.

I am at (7, 6). The nearest apple is at (13, 6), which is 6 units away — a significant distance. There is dirt at (7, 7), just one step away, which is very close. The river is currently dirty, and apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning cleaning dirt is essential to enable apple spawning in the future.

Currently, I have no apple in sight that I can immediately eat. The only nearby apple is 6 steps away, which would require a long journey. Meanwhile, cleaning the dirt at (7, 7) is only one step away — a minimal effort.

Key trade-off:
- Eating an apple: Would give +1.0 immediately, but the nearest apple is far away, and there's no apple nearby to eat. So this option is not viable right now.
- Cleaning dirt: Requires only one step (to (7, 7)), and it enables future apple spawning. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, cleaning dirt is necessary for future rewards — both for myself and for the group. This action has no immediate reward but creates long-term value.

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 2). You see dirt at (8, 2).
  Thinking: I am at (8, 2), and I see dirt at that exact location. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 4 units away — a reasonable distance. However, apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, meaning dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning. Currently, there is dirt at (8, 2), so no apples can spawn there or nearby unless cleaned.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple currently visible at (8, 2). The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 4 units away. Since we are standing on dirt, we cannot eat an apple unless we first move to a location with an apple. But even then, apples only appear *after* the river is cleaned. So, unless we clean the dirt first, apples won’t spawn at all. Therefore, eating an apple is not possible right now — it's not available. So this option is invalid.

2. **Clean the dirt at (8, 2) to enable future apple spawning?**  
   Yes. This is critical. Dirt must be cleaned to allow apples to spawn. Since the nearest apple

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see agent 1 at (7, 6).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am at (7, 5), and I see Agent 1 at (7, 6) — directly above me. The nearest apple is at (13, 6), which is 7 units away. That's quite far. The nearest dirt is at (7, 7), which is just one step above me — distance 2. This is very close.

Key point: Apples only spawn when the river is clean. So, dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning. Currently, there's dirt at (7, 7), and cleaning it would allow apples to appear in that area or nearby. Since apples are not currently spawning, cleaning dirt is essential for future apple availability.

Now, the trade-off:
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately — but the nearest apple is 7 units away, and I’d have to move through potentially dirty terrain to reach it. There’s no indication that apples are spawning now, so even if I go to (13,6), there's no guarantee it's available.
- Cleaning dirt at (7,7) gives no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning. Since the nearest apple is

--- Step 31 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (1, 1). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 2 at (2, 0).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only 1 step away — this is the closest apple to me, and it provides a direct +1.0 reward with no risk or cost.
- There is no nearby dirt to clean (the nearest dirt is at (7, 0), which is 6 steps away). Cleaning dirt is a long-term strategy that only becomes beneficial if apples are not spawning due to dirt — but in this current state, apples are already spawning (we see one at (1, 0)), so there's no immediate need to clean.
- Agent 2 is at (2, 0), which is adjacent to the apple. If I don’t eat it now, agent 2 might eat it before me — and that would mean I lose the opportunity for immediate reward. Since we are playing to maximize *my* points, and I have no information suggesting that cleaning dirt would benefit me more in the short term, I should prioritize immediate gains.
- The trade-off between immediate reward and future spawning is not favorable here because future spawning is already happening (apples exist), and cleaning dirt is not required to maintain that.

Therefore, the optimal action is to eat the
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 1, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 0). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 1 at (1, 1).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only one step away — at (1, 0), which is directly adjacent to my current position (2, 0). Eating it gives me +1.0 point immediately, which directly increases my score.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 0), which is 5 steps away. Cleaning it would require moving through multiple tiles, and there's no indication that any dirt is nearby or that apple spawning is currently blocked. Since apples are already spawning (we see one at (1, 0)), the river is already clean enough to support apple growth — so cleaning dirt is not urgent or necessary right now.
- There is no immediate threat or obstacle. Agent 1 is at (1, 1), which is adjacent to the apple, but there's no indication they are blocking access or posing a risk. The apple is on land, and I can reach it without conflict.
- Since the goal is to maximize points, and immediate action (eating an apple) yields a clear, tangible reward with no risk, it is optimal to take that opportunity.

Therefore, the best action is to eat the apple at (1, 0).
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 1, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 2). You see dirt at (8, 1), dirt at (7, 2) and dirt at (8, 2).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

You are currently at (8, 2). The observation says there is **dirt at (8, 1), (7, 2), and (8, 2)** — so you are standing on dirt. That means you are *on* dirt, and the river is currently dirty (since dirt blocks apple spawning). Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be removed.

The global scan shows:
- The **nearest apple** is at (12, 2), 4 units away.
- The **nearest dirt** is at (8, 2), distance 0 — meaning you are currently on dirt.

Now, consider the two key decisions:

---

### Option 1: Eat an apple for immediate reward?
- There is **no apple visible** at your current position (8, 2). The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 4 steps away.
- To eat an apple, you must first **reach it**, which requires moving through clean land.
- But currently, the land is dirty — apples don’t spawn on dirty land.
- Therefore, **you cannot eat an apple right now** because there are no apples available on clean

--- Step 32 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (1, 1). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 2 at (2, 0).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only 1 step away — this is a direct, actionable opportunity for a +1.0 point reward.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 0), which is 7 steps away. Cleaning it would provide future apples, but it requires significant movement and time without any immediate benefit.
- There is no indication that the river is currently dirty or that apple spawning is currently blocked — the apple is already present, meaning the river is already clean enough for spawning to occur.
- Agent 2 is at (2, 0), which is adjacent to the apple. If agent 2 is also trying to eat the apple, there may be a conflict. However, since the apple is at (1, 0), and I am at (1, 1), I can reach it before agent 2 can (they would need to move from (2,0) to (1,0), which is one step). So I have a slight tactical advantage — I can consume it before agent 2 does.

Therefore, the immediate reward is both accessible and beneficial. Cleaning dirt at (7,0) is a long-term strategy with no current
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 1, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 0). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 1 at (1, 1).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only 1 step away — this is the closest apple to me, and eating it gives a direct +1.0 point with no risk or cost.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 0), which is 5 steps away. Cleaning it would require significant movement and time, and there's no immediate benefit to doing so — apples only spawn *when the river is clean*, which means dirt cleaning is a long-term, indirect action with no current reward.
- There is no immediate threat or obstacle from agent 1 at (1, 1), and I can safely move to (1, 0) to eat the apple. I can then consider future cleaning if and when it becomes necessary.
- In a cleanup game, while cleaning dirt is important for future apple spawning, it's not a priority if immediate rewards are available and feasible. The rule states that apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning the cleanup is a prerequisite, not a standalone action with immediate benefit. Therefore, without an immediate need or threat, it's rational to prioritize available rewards.

Thus, eating the apple now maximizes immediate points and aligns with the goal
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 1, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 2). You see dirt at (8, 1) and dirt at (7, 2).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (8, 1).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 4 units away — quite far. Eating it now would give +1.0 point, but it's not immediately accessible or guaranteed.
- There is dirt at (8, 1), just one step away from my current position (8, 2). This is the nearest dirt and the only dirt visible in the global scan.
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple spawning. Without cleaning dirt, no apples will appear, even if we move far.
- There is no immediate apple nearby (the nearest is 4 units away), and we are already at (8, 2), so no point in eating one now.
- Cleaning dirt at (8, 1) is a low-effort, high-impact action: it takes one move (down to (8, 1)), and once cleaned, it improves the environment for future apple spawns, especially since apples are likely to spawn along the path toward (12, 2).
- Since the goal is to maximize points over time, and apples are not spawning now

  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 4). You see dirt at (6, 3).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 3).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 8 units away — quite far. There are no apples visible in the immediate vicinity, and the only apple we know of is distant.
- The dirt at (6, 3) is only 1 unit away — very close — and cleaning it would be a minimal movement cost (one step down to (6, 3), then clean).
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be removed to enable apple spawning. This is a systemic rule: cleaning dirt enables future apple generation. Since apples are essential for scoring, and we are in a cleanup game where long-term success depends on enabling apple spawns, cleaning dirt is a necessary investment.
- Eating an apple immediately would give a +1.0 reward, but there are no apples currently visible or accessible. Without cleaning dirt, future apple spawning is blocked — which would starve the group of rewards.
- The trade-off is between immediate reward (which isn't available) and enabling future rewards (which is directly possible by cleaning nearby dirt).

Therefore, cleaning the dirt at (6, 3) is the optimal action.
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 3}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 6). You see dirt at (7, 7).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 7).

Reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (13, 6), which is 6 units away. That means I would need to move through several tiles to reach it, and there's currently no apple spawning because the river is not clean.
- The dirt at (7, 7) is only 1 tile away — extremely close. Cleaning it would directly improve the river's cleanliness, which increases the chance of apples spawning in the future, especially in the region around (13, 6).
- Eating an apple immediately would give a +1.0 reward, but there are no apples visible in the current vicinity. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and we currently have dirt blocking that condition, there is no immediate apple to be eaten.
- Cleaning dirt does not give immediate points, but it enables future apple spawning — a long-term, strategic benefit that supports the group's overall goal.
- Since the dirt is adjacent and the apple is far away, it makes sense to prioritize cleaning the dirt to unlock future apple availability. Without cleaning, even if I reach (13, 6), there may be no apples to eat because the environment remains dirty.

Therefore, the

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 0). You see dirt at (6, 1).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 1).

Reasoning:

- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Currently, there is dirt at (6, 1), which likely prevents apple spawning in nearby areas. Since the nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 5 units away, and the dirt is only 3 units away, it's not immediately reachable or accessible for apple collection.
- Eating an apple now would give a +1.0 reward, but there are no apples visible in the current field of view. The nearest apple is far away, and without cleaning the dirt, the area around the river (which may be adjacent to the apple spawn zones) will remain barren.
- Cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apple spawning. By removing dirt at (6, 1), I enable the possibility of apples appearing in nearby land areas — potentially leading to future apple spawns, which would benefit both myself and the group.
- There is no immediate reward in exploring empty or barren land without first enabling apple spawning. Without cleaning, future apple access is blocked.
- Moving to (6, 1) is a short path (only 3 steps from (8, 0)) and will allow me to clean
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 3). You see dirt at (6, 3).
  Thinking: I am at (6, 3), where there is dirt. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 7 units away. There is no apple currently visible at my location — only dirt. Eating an apple is only possible if one is present, and none are visible at (6, 3). Therefore, **I cannot eat an apple immediately**.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple?**  
   → No apple is present at (6, 3). There's no immediate apple to eat. This option is invalid.

2. **Clean the dirt at (6, 3)?**  
   → Yes. Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning in the future. The rule states that apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt). Since dirt is currently at (6, 3), and it's the nearest dirt, cleaning it will help create conditions for apples to appear later.  
   → Even though cleaning gives no immediate reward, it's a prerequisite for future apple spawns. This action supports the group's long-term goal of maximizing apple consumption.

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 7). You see dirt at (7, 7).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 7), and I see dirt at that exact location. The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 6 units away — on the same row, so a straightforward path to the right. However, apples only spawn when the river is clean, meaning that dirt must be cleaned before apples can appear.

Currently, there is dirt at (7, 7), which means no apples are spawning in that area — even though the nearest apple is at (13, 7), it's not guaranteed to be available yet. The presence of dirt blocks apple spawning, so unless the dirt is cleaned, apples won't appear.

Now, evaluating the options:

1. **Eat an apple immediately?**  
   There is no apple at (7, 7). The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 6 steps away. Since we are currently on dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean, we cannot eat an apple right now. Even if we moved to (13, 7), we would need to ensure the dirt is cleaned along the path — or at least that the river is clean enough for apples to spawn. Therefore, eating an apple is not possible

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 0). You see dirt at (6, 1).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

Currently, I am at position (7, 0). The nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 6 units away — a significant distance. There is dirt at (6, 1), which is only 2 units away from my current position. This means I can reach the dirt quickly and clean it.

Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple spawning. Even though cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, it enables future apple growth, which benefits both the group and my long-term ability to collect apples.

Right now, there are no apples visible nearby. The nearest apple is far away (6 units), and there's no indication of any apples spawning due to dirt at (6,1). Therefore, eating an apple immediately would not be beneficial — there are no apples in immediate range, and the global scan shows no nearby apples.

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here's the reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — a significant distance that would require a long journey.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is very close — just 1 unit away — meaning it's within reach and directly adjacent to my current position (7, 3).
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. This means that cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple spawning. Without cleaning, no apples will appear, regardless of how far I walk.
- Eating an apple now would give a +1.0 reward, but there are no apples available at my current location or nearby. The nearest apple is far away and cannot spawn until the river is clean.
- Since I am at (7, 3), I can move to (7, 4) to clean the dirt in one step (no diagonal movement needed). This action has no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning — which benefits the entire group and increases long-term points.
- If I skip cleaning now, I will have to travel to (12,

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4), even though it doesn't give immediate reward.

Reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — a significant distance. Given that apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), I must first ensure the environment is conducive to apple spawning.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), just one step away from my current position (7, 2). This is a very close and accessible target.
- Cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apples to appear. Without cleaning, no apples will spawn — meaning I cannot gain any apple reward in the future, regardless of how far away they are.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0, but since no apples are currently spawning (due to dirt present), it's impossible to eat one. The apple at (12, 2) is not visible or accessible unless the river is clean.
- Therefore, the immediate action of cleaning dirt at (7, 4) is not only necessary but strategic — it enables future apple spawning, which is essential for long-term point accumulation.
- Moving toward (7, 4) is straightforward (one

Key rule: Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned to allow apple spawning. Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but enables future apple spawns. So, cleaning is a long-term investment.

Immediate reward: Eating an apple gives +1.0 point.  
But apples are far away — 5 steps from (7,5) to (2,5). That means you'd need to walk 5 steps to reach it, and there's no indication that any apples are currently spawning (since dirt is present).

Right now, there is dirt at (7,4), (6,5), and (7,6). The closest dirt is at (7,4), just one step away. Cleaning it would be the most efficient immediate action — it's within reach and would help make the land around it clean

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here’s the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away. That means I would need to travel at least 6 steps to reach it. However, apples only spawn when the river is clean — specifically, when there is no dirt on land. Currently, there is dirt at (7, 4), which is directly adjacent to my current position (7, 3). This dirt is blocking the possibility of apple spawning in that region, and since apples spawn only when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is removed), I must first address it.

- Eating an apple immediately would give +1.0 point, but the apple at (12, 2) is far away and requires a long path. Moreover, the apple is only available *if* the river is clean. Since the dirt at (7, 4) is still present, no apples can spawn in the vicinity — meaning I can’t even access that apple without first cleaning the dirt.

- Cleaning the dirt at (7, 4) is a necessary prerequisite for future apple spawning. It takes no immediate reward, but it enables future apple generation. Since the
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am at (7, 2), and I see Agent 1 at (7, 3) — directly above me. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away horizontally. The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), which is only 2 units away vertically — directly above me. 

Key facts:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned).
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but enables future apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.
- I cannot move diagonally, so movement is restricted to cardinal directions.

Now, the trade-off:
1. **Eat an apple?** The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 steps away. I can reach it, but it’s not immediately available. I have no apple in my possession — I must first reach it. So, eating an apple isn't possible right now unless I already have one. The observation doesn’t indicate that any apple is currently edible.

2. **Clean dirt?** The dirt is at (7, 4), just one step
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4), dirt at (6, 5) and dirt at (7, 6).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here's the reasoning:

- The immediate reward of eating an apple is +1.0, which seems tempting. However, the nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away — a significant distance. Given that we are at (7, 5), reaching it would require navigating through potentially dirty terrain and would take multiple moves.
  
- More importantly, the rule states that apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning. Right now, there is dirt at (7, 4), (6, 5), and (7, 6). The dirt at (7, 4) is only one step away from our current position. Cleaning it would directly contribute to making land viable for apple growth in that area.

- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it is a necessary prerequisite for future apple spawning. Since apples are the only source of points, and they are not currently spawning due to dirt, cleaning is a strategic investment in long-term gains.

- There is no nearby apple within reach, and the global scan shows the nearest apple is far away. Therefore, there is no immediate benefit to eating an apple

--- Step 32 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see dirt at (7, 2).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 2), and I see dirt at that exact location. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 steps away. Right now, there is no apple visible at my current position — I'm standing on dirt. 

Key facts:
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed).
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward but enables future apple spawning.
- I cannot move diagonally — so movement is constrained to cardinal directions (up, down, left, right).

Current situation:
- I am on dirt at (7, 2).
- There is no apple at (7, 2) — I cannot eat one immediately.
- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), 5 steps away — that would require first cleaning the dirt at (7, 2) to make land available, or moving to a land tile before reaching it.

But here's the critical point: **I cannot eat an apple unless I'm on land**. Since I'm currently on dirt, I cannot eat an apple right now. So option 1 ("eat an apple") is not
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 2}} -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 5). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the trade-off between immediate reward and long-term benefit.

Currently, I'm at (8, 5). The nearest apple is at (13, 6), which is 6 units away — a significant distance. The nearest dirt is at (7, 2), which is only 4 units away. This suggests that cleaning dirt is both feasible and relatively close.

Key points:
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately, but apples only spawn *when the river is clean*. So, if I eat an apple now, I’m not actually getting access to more apples in the future — the apple I eat might be one of the few that are already present, and there’s no guarantee more will spawn.
- Cleaning dirt is not rewarding immediately, but it enables future apple spawning. Since apples spawn only when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt), cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple availability.
- The dirt is at (7, 2), which is within reach — a distance of 4 moves (down 3, left 1, or other paths). This is manageable and strategically important.
- There are no visible apples nearby, and the nearest apple is far away. If I don’t
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 2}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (1, 0). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully.

I am at (1, 0). The nearest apple is at (13, 0), 12 units away — quite far. The nearest dirt is at (7, 0), 6 units away. There are no visible apples nearby, and I see nothing of interest in my immediate vicinity.

Let’s evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple** — There is no apple in range. I am at (1, 0), and the nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 12 steps away. I cannot eat an apple immediately. So this option is not viable right now.

2. **Clean dirt** — This is the only actionable step available. Dirt at (7, 0) is only 6 steps away. Cleaning it will help create conditions for apples to spawn later — specifically, when the river is clean (less dirt), apples can spawn. This is a necessary prerequisite for future apple generation. Even though cleaning gives no immediate reward, it enables future rewards for the group. Since apples are the only source of points and they only spawn when the river is clean, cleaning dirt is essential to the long-term success.

--- Step 33 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to analyze the trade-off carefully based on the current situation and long-term goals.

Currently, I am at (7, 2). The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — a moderate distance. However, the nearest dirt is at (7, 0), which is only 2 units away. This means I can reach the dirt in just two moves (down to (7, 1), then to (7, 0)).

Crucially, apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning that cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apple spawning. Right now, there are no apples visible, and the global scan indicates that apples are only available *after* dirt is cleaned. Therefore, eating an apple immediately is not possible — there are no apples in the current state.

Even if I were to move toward the apple at (12, 2), I would still need to clean the dirt at (7, 0) first to enable apples to spawn in the future. Since apples only appear when the river is clean, cleaning dirt is not just a side task — it's a foundational requirement.

Moreover, the dirt at (7, 0) is directly adjacent to my current position
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 7).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (13, 6), which is 7 units away — quite far. There’s no immediate apple in sight at (7, 5), and eating one now would give only +1.0 point, but it would not contribute to long-term success.
- The nearest dirt is at (6, 7), just 3 units away — very close. Cleaning dirt is not rewarding on its own, but it is essential for enabling apples to spawn in the future. Apples only appear when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is reduced).
- Since apples spawn only when the river is clean, if we don’t clean the dirt, future apple spawns (including the one at (13, 6)) will not occur. This means we risk missing out on future rewards entirely.
- The trade-off between immediate reward and future potential is clear: eating an apple now gives a small, one-time gain, but cleaning dirt ensures future apple availability — which is critical for maximizing total points over time.
- Given that there’s no nearby apple and the dirt is within reach, it makes strategic sense to prioritize cleaning.

Therefore, I

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 0). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: Given the current situation, I must carefully analyze the trade-offs between immediate reward and long-term benefit.

**Current Position**: (2, 0)  
**Nearest Apple**: (13, 0) — 11 units away  
**Nearest Dirt**: (7, 0) — 5 units away  

### Option 1: Eat an Apple?
- Immediate reward: +1.0 point  
- But the apple is 11 units away — very far, and there's no indication of any apple spawning nearby.  
- Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is removed), and we currently have dirt at (7,0), there is no apple spawning available *right now*.  
- Therefore, **no apple is currently visible or accessible** — eating one is not possible at this moment.  
→ **Invalid option**.

### Option 2: Clean Dirt?
- Dirt at (7,0) is only 5 units away — very reachable from (2,0).  
- Cleaning dirt has **no immediate reward**, but it enables future apple spawning.  
- Apples spawn *only* when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed).  
- With dirt present

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 1). You see dirt at (7, 0).

--- Step 33 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 4). You see agent 2 at (8, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am currently at (8, 4), and I see Agent 2 at (8, 3) — directly above me, so we are adjacent. This suggests potential coordination or competition. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — a significant distance. The nearest dirt is at (7, 7), which is 4 units away — relatively close.

Let’s break down the trade-offs:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   - Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.  
   - However, apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned).  
   - Right now, there is no apple visible in the immediate vicinity — the nearest is at (12, 2), which is far from me.  
   - If I eat an apple now, I’m assuming one exists at (12, 2), but that apple hasn’t spawned yet because the river isn’t clean.  
   - Therefore, **I cannot eat an apple right now** — there’s no apple in my immediate area, and the apple at (12,

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 3). You see agent 1 at (8, 4).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am at (8, 3), and I see Agent 1 at (8, 4) — directly above me, so we're in close proximity. That means there's potential for coordination or conflict, but since the goal is to maximize points by eating apples, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), I must consider the trade-off between immediate reward and long-term sustainability.

Let’s break it down:

1. **Immediate apple reward?**  
   The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away. I can reach it via a path like (8,3) → (9,3) → (10,3) → (11,3) → (12,3) → (12,2), or a more direct path like (8,3) → (8,2) → (8,1) → (8,0) → (7,0) → (7,1) → (7,2) → (8,2) → (9,2) → (10,2) → (11,2
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (13, 7). You see an apple at (13, 6).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (13, 6).

Reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only one step away — this is a direct, positive reward (+1.0 point) with no risk or cost.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 7), which is 6 steps away. Cleaning it would require significant movement and time, and there is no immediate benefit from doing so. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and we don't currently have a clean river, cleaning dirt is a long-term strategy.
- However, the current state of the environment — with an apple right next to me — means I can gain immediate value without sacrificing progress toward future goals.
- There's no indication that future apple spawns are guaranteed or imminent; thus, the trade-off between immediate reward and future potential is heavily weighted in favor of the immediate action.
- The rule says cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward — so it's not a positive action on its own. Without a clear future need or benefit, it's not rational to delay the immediate gain.

Therefore, the optimal action is to eat the apple at (13, 6) to maximize points now. Afterward, I can plan a route to clean the dirt at (

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 4). You see agent 2 at (8, 4).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully and make a strategic decision based on the goals and constraints.

Current position: (7, 4)  
Agent 2 is at (8, 4) — directly adjacent, so potential for interaction or competition.  
Nearest apple: (2, 5), distance = 6 units — far away.  
Nearest dirt: (7, 7), distance = 3 units — very close, only 3 steps away.  

Key points:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed).  
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.  
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward but enables future apple spawning.  
- There are no apples nearby — the nearest is 6 steps away.  
- Dirt is only 3 steps away — very accessible.  

Now, evaluating the trade-offs:

1. **Should I eat an apple?**  
   No nearby apples exist. The nearest apple is at (2,5), which is 6 steps away. There's no indication of any apple spawning in the immediate vicinity. Eating an apple now would require moving to a location where one is already present — which isn’t the case. So, there
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 7}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 4). You see agent 1 at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I am at (8, 4), and I see Agent 1 at (7, 4) — directly to my left. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 steps away. The nearest dirt is at (7, 7), which is 4 steps away (down and right).

Let’s analyze the trade-offs:

1. **Should I eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple immediately available at my current position. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is quite far — 6 steps away. Eating it would require movement and time, and since apples only spawn *when the river is clean*, I can’t just eat one if it’s not present. Also, the apple at (12, 2) is not currently spawning — it only exists when the river is clean. So, eating it now would be impossible. Therefore, **I cannot eat an apple immediately**.

2. **Should I clean dirt to ensure future apples spawn?**  
   Yes — cleaning dirt is essential. Dirt blocks apple spawning. The nearest dirt is at (7, 7), which is only 4 steps away. From (8, 4),
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 7}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (13, 6). You see an apple at (13, 6).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (13, 6).

Reasoning:

- The apple is at my current position (13, 6), so I can immediately consume it and gain +1.0 point — this is a direct, tangible reward with no risk or cost.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 7), which is 7 units away. Cleaning it would require movement and time, and there is no immediate benefit to cleaning it — apples only spawn when the river is clean, but we don’t currently have any apple spawn conditions met. The presence of an apple at (13, 6) suggests that the river *is* already clean in that area, or at least that the conditions are favorable.
- Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and we already have an apple available, cleaning dirt is not urgent or necessary at this moment. It would be a long-term strategy, but with no immediate apple spawn or reward from cleaning, it's a waste of time.
- There is no indication that future apples will spawn without cleaning, nor is there any information suggesting that cleaning dirt will increase apple availability in a way that justifies the delay.

Therefore, the optimal action is to eat the apple immediately — it provides

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see agent 2 at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am at (7, 5), and I see Agent 2 at (7, 4). That means we are adjacent vertically — a potential conflict or coordination point. The nearest apple is at (4, 6), which is 4 units away — a moderate distance. The nearest dirt is at (7, 7), just 2 units away. This dirt is critical because apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning cleaning dirt enables future apple spawning, which benefits the group.

Now, the trade-off:

1. **Eating an apple now** gives +1.0 point immediately. However, there are no apples visible nearby — the nearest is at (4, 6), which requires moving through open terrain. There’s no indication of an apple spawn in immediate vicinity. So, eating one would be premature and likely not optimal, especially if I can get to the apple later after cleaning the dirt to make the environment more favorable.

- The dirt at (7, 4) is adjacent and directly reachable. Cleaning it is

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully and make a strategic decision based on the game rules and current state.

Current position: (7, 3)  
Agent 2 is at (7, 2) — directly above me.  
Dirt is at (7, 4) — directly to my right.  
Nearest apple is at (12, 2), 6 units away.  
The nearest dirt is only 1 unit away — at (7, 4).  

Key rule: Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Cleaning dirt enables future apple spawning, but it gives no immediate reward. Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately.

Now, the trade-off:

1. **Eat an apple?**  
   The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 steps away. To reach it, I’d need to go from (7,3) → (7,4) to clean dirt? No — I can’t eat an apple until I reach it. But currently, there’s no apple visible at my current location or nearby. I see only dirt at (7,4), and no apple in the immediate vicinity. So, I cannot eat an apple *now*.
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see dirt at (8, 1) and agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (8, 1).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — quite far. There's no immediate apple nearby at (7, 2), so eating one now would provide no benefit and wastes a potential opportunity to gain future apples.
- The dirt at (8, 1) is only 2 units away — very close. Cleaning it will improve the river's cleanliness, which directly enables apple spawning on land. This is a necessary prerequisite for future apple generation.
- The rule states that apples only spawn when the river is clean. Without cleaning dirt, even if we move toward apples, they won't appear. So cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for long-term success.
- Agent 1 is at (7, 3), which is adjacent to me, but there's no indication of conflict or competition for resources — the goal is to maximize points through apple collection, not to avoid agents. Since apples depend on clean rivers, and we can only get them after cleaning, the priority is environmental preparation.
- There's no immediate reward in eating an apple here — it would be a short-term gain with no strategic advantage. In contrast, cleaning dirt is

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4), dirt at (6, 5) and dirt at (7, 6).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to make the best decision as Agent 3.

Current position: (7, 5)  
Visible dirt: (7, 4), (6, 5), (7, 6)  
Nearest apple: (2, 5) — distance 5  
Nearest dirt: (7, 4) — distance 1  

Key facts:
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Clean = less dirt. So dirt must be removed to enable apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately, but only if an apple is present and accessible.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but is essential for future apple spawning.
- I cannot move diagonally — only up, down, left, right.

Now, let's assess the options:

1. **Eat an apple?**  
   The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away. To reach it, I’d need to move through the grid. However, there is no indication that an apple is currently visible or accessible — only that one exists at (2, 5). There’s no mention of an apple being present at my current location or nearby. So,

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (8, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — quite far. There are no apples in immediate proximity (within 1-2 steps), so eating an apple now would not yield a meaningful immediate reward.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 step away — very close. Cleaning it will improve the river’s cleanliness, which directly enables apple spawning in the future. This is a necessary precondition for apples to appear.
- The game mechanics explicitly state that apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Therefore, cleaning dirt is not just beneficial — it's a prerequisite for future apple availability.
- Since there's no immediate apple nearby, and the dirt is within reach, the optimal action is to clean it. This supports long-term goal achievement (more apples for the group), aligns with the group's shared objective, and avoids wasting time or energy on unproductive actions.
- Moving to (8, 2) to interact with agent 2 is not necessary or beneficial — there's no indication of conflict, cooperation, or resource sharing. Agent 2 is not blocking, and no interaction is required.
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 2). You see dirt at (8, 1) and agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to determine the best course of action.

Current position: (8, 2)  
Visible dirt: (8, 1) — only 1 step away  
Agent 1 is at (7, 3) — not directly blocking, but may be a concern for coordination  
Nearest apple: (12, 2) — 4 steps away  
Dirt at (8,1) is the nearest dirt, and cleaning it would allow apples to spawn in the future.

Let’s break down the options:

1. **Eat an apple immediately**  
   - There is no apple at (8,2) — the nearest apple is at (12,2), which is 4 steps away.  
   - Eating an apple requires being on a land tile with an apple.  
   - No apple is visible or immediately accessible.  
   - Immediate reward is not possible here.  
   → **Not viable.**

2. **Clean the dirt at (8,1)**  
   - This is the nearest dirt (distance = 1).  
   - Cleaning it would improve the river's cleanliness, enabling apple spawning in the future.  
   - Even though cleaning gives no immediate reward, it

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4), dirt at (6, 5) and dirt at (7, 6).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the current situation and make a strategic decision based on the rules and goals.

Current position: (7, 5)  
Dirt locations: (7, 4), (6, 5), (7, 6)  
Nearest apple: (2, 5), distance = 5  
Nearest dirt: (7, 4), distance = 1  

Immediate options:
- Eat an apple at (2, 5)? → Not possible directly, because it's 5 units away and we can't move diagonally. We’d need to walk there step-by-step, and there's no apple visible in range.
- Clean dirt? → Dirt at (7,4), (6,5), (7,6) are all adjacent or nearby. The closest dirt is at (7,4), just one step away. Cleaning it would improve the river's cleanliness and allow apples to spawn in the future.

Key insight:
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. So, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apple spawning.
- There are no apples currently visible in immediate range. The nearest apple is at (2,5), which is 5 steps away — far and not accessible without

--- Step 36 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
- There is no nearby apple to eat — the nearest is 6 steps away and only exists in a clean state.
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am at (7, 2), and I see Agent 1 at (7, 3). The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — a moderate distance. The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), which is only 2 units away. This dirt is directly ahead of me, in the same column, and accessible in one move (up to (7, 3), then to (7, 4)).

Now, let's evaluate the trade-offs:

1. **Eating an apple for immediate reward**:  
   The apple at (12, 2) is far away — 5 steps. To reach it, I'd need to move right to (8,2), then (9,2), (10,2), (11,2), (12,2). That's 5 moves. If I eat it, I get +1.0 point immediately. But is it worth it? Only if I can get there safely and efficiently. However, if I don't clean the dirt, apples won’t spawn — meaning future apple availability is limited. So, if I
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4), dirt at (6, 5) and dirt at (7, 6).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4), not eat an apple.

Here's the reasoning:

- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Right now, there is dirt at (7, 4), (6, 5), and (7, 6). This dirt is blocking apple spawning in those areas. Since the nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 steps away, it's not immediately accessible due to the presence of dirt. Without cleaning the dirt, apples will not spawn at all — meaning no apples can be eaten in the future.

- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 point, but only if there's an apple available. However, there is no apple visible at (7, 5) or nearby. The only apple mentioned is at (2, 5), which is far away and likely blocked by dirt. Therefore, eating an apple immediately is not possible — there's no apple to eat in the current vicinity.

- Cleaning dirt (e.g., at (7, 4)) is a necessary precondition for apples to spawn. Since the dirt at (7, 4) is adjacent and only one step away, it's the closest and most accessible dirt.

--- Step 33 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the current situation and the trade-offs.

I am currently at (7, 3). Agent 2 is at (7, 2), directly above me. There is dirt at (7, 4), which is directly to my right. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — a significant distance. The dirt at (7, 4) is only 1 unit away, so it's very close and immediately accessible.

Let’s evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward**  
   - There is no apple in immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), requiring movement to the right and down.  
   - There's no indication of any apple spawning near me currently.  
   - Eating an apple requires being *on* an apple. Since no apple is visible or reachable in one step, this option is not viable right now.  
   → **Not feasible.**

2. **Clean the dirt at (7, 4)**  
   - This is the only dirt visible and is only 1 unit away.  
   - Cleaning dirt has no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning — which is essential
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am at (7, 2), and I see Agent 1 at (7, 3) — directly above me. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away. The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), just one step above me — a distance of only 2 units. 

Key points:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed).
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but enables future apple spawning — which benefits the group.
- I cannot move diagonally, so movement is constrained to up/down/left/right.

Now, the trade-off:
- Option 1: Eat an apple at (12, 2). But to do so, I must reach it — 5 steps away. There's no apple currently visible in my immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is far away, and there's no indication that it's spawning yet (since the river is not clean).
- Option 2: Clean the dirt at (7, 4). This is only 2 steps away — very close. Cleaning

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4), dirt at (6, 5) and dirt at (7, 6).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to determine the best course of action.

Current position: (7, 5)  
Visible dirt: (7, 4) and (6, 5) and (7, 6)  
Nearest apple: (2, 5), distance 5  
Nearest dirt: (7, 4), distance 1  

Key considerations:

1. **Immediate reward vs. long-term benefit**:  
   - Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately, which is valuable.  
   - However, apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned.  
   - Right now, there is dirt at (7, 4), which is only 1 step away.  
   - Cleaning that dirt would improve the environment for future apple spawning, potentially enabling more apples to appear in the future.  
   - Since apples are currently not spawning (no visible apples), cleaning dirt is necessary to enable them.  

2. **Is there an apple nearby?**  
   - The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 steps away.  
   - There are no apples visible in the immediate vicinity.  
   - Therefore, there is no immediate apple to eat

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully and make a strategic decision based on the rules and current state.

Current position: (7, 3)  
Agent 2 is at (7, 2) — directly above me, so we're in the same column.  
Dirt is at (7, 4) — directly to my right (east).  
Nearest apple is at (12, 2), 6 units away.  
The nearest dirt is only 1 unit away — at (7, 4).  

Key rules:
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed).
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but enables future apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.
- Movement is only allowed orthogonally (up, down, left, right).
- No diagonal movement.

Now, the trade-off:

1. **Eat an apple now?**  
   The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 steps away. To reach it, I’d need to go east to (7, 4) — but that’s dirt. I can’t walk on dirt. So I must first clean the dirt
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see dirt at (8, 1) and agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am currently at (7, 2).  
- There is dirt at (8, 1), which is only 1 step away (distance = 1).  
- Agent 1 is at (7, 3), which is directly above me — possibly a potential interaction point.  
- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), 5 steps away.  
- Dirt cleaning has no immediate reward, but it enables apples to spawn in the future — crucial for long-term success.  

Now, evaluating the trade-offs:

1. **Should I eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There is no apple currently visible or nearby. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 steps away. I’m not at any apple location. So, I cannot eat an apple right now. This option is not viable.

2. **Should I clean the dirt at (8, 1)?**  

--- Step 34 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 7). You see agent 3 at (7, 6) and dirt at (7, 7).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 7).

Here's the reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 6 steps away — far enough that immediate apple consumption is not feasible.
- The dirt at (7, 7) is directly where I am, and cleaning it will improve the river's cleanliness, which enables apple spawning in the future. This is a critical prerequisite for apples to appear.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0, but there are no apples available at this location. The apple at (13, 7) is not accessible without first cleaning the river (which is currently dirty at (7, 7)).
- Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, cleaning the dirt is a necessary step to unlock future apple generation — not just for me, but for the entire group. This supports long-term sustainability and shared goals.
- Moving toward (13, 7) without cleaning would be futile — the apple will not spawn until the river is clean.

Therefore, the optimal action is to clean the dirt at (7, 7). This enables future apple spawning, supports the group's collective progress, and
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 7}} -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 2). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the trade-off between immediate reward and long-term benefit.

Currently, I am at (8, 2). The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is just 4 units away — a short, straightforward path. Since I can move only in cardinal directions (up, down, left, right), this is a manageable distance. Eating the apple at (12, 2) would give me an immediate +1.0 point, which is a clear and direct reward.

However, the dirt at (7, 7) is 6 units away — quite far — and cleaning it would enable future apple spawning. But there's no indication that apples are currently spawning or that the river is dirty in a way that would prevent spawning. The rule states that apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt), so cleaning dirt is necessary for future apple generation. But since the nearest apple is already within reach, and no apples are currently visible or accessible, I must ask: is there any immediate benefit to cleaning dirt now?

Given that:
- I have no immediate need to clean dirt (the apples are already spawnable at (12, 2) if the river is clean),
- The

  Obs: You are at (7, 6). You see dirt at (7, 7) and agent 1 at (7, 7).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 7).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (13, 6), which is 6 units away. To reach it, I would need to move through multiple tiles, and there's no immediate apple nearby to eat for a reward.
- The dirt at (7, 7) is directly adjacent to my current position (7, 6), meaning it's within one move. Cleaning it would directly improve the river's cleanliness, which in turn increases the likelihood of apples spawning in the future.
- Eating an apple now would give me +1.0 point, but there are no apples visible nearby. The only apple is far away (distance 6), and there’s no indication that it will spawn immediately or be accessible without first cleaning the dirt.
- The rule states that apples only spawn when the river is clean. Therefore, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple generation. Without cleaning, no apples will appear — even if I walk to (13, 6), I won’t be able to eat one.
- Since I’m at (7, 6) and the dirt is at (7, 7), I can move to (7, 7) in

--- Step 35 ---
Moving from (7, 7) towards (13, 7).
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 7). You see agent 3 at (7, 6).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

You are at (7, 7). Agent 3 is at (7, 6) — directly adjacent, so there's potential for interaction or coordination. However, the global scan shows:

- **Nearest Apple**: at (13, 7), which is 6 units away — a reasonable distance, but not immediate.
- **Nearest Dirt**: *None found* in the global scan.

This is critical: **There is no dirt to clean**. Therefore, the action of "cleaning dirt" to enable future apple spawning is **not possible** right now. Since dirt is not present, cleaning it cannot happen — and thus, the trade-off of "cleaning dirt for future apples" is **not viable** in this state.

Now, consider the two options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward**:
   - The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 6 steps away.
   - You can reach it via a path along the row (e.g., moving right to (13,7)), which is straightforward.
   - Eating an apple gives +1.0 point — immediate, tangible reward.
   - Since there is no dirt to clean
  Decision: {'action': 'move_to', 'args': {'coord_x': 13, 'coord_y': 7}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Moving from (9, 2) towards (12, 2).
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (9, 2). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: Given the current situation:

- You are at (9, 2).  
- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 3 units away — a reasonable distance.  
- There is **no dirt** in the global scan, meaning there's no immediate dirt to clean.  
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed). Since no dirt is visible, there is currently **no spawning condition** for apples.  
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 point, but **no apples are currently available** to eat.  
- The global scan says "Nearest Dirt: None found," which implies that dirt is not present or not detectable in the current view — so there's no immediate action to clean.

### Key Realization:
You **cannot eat an apple** unless one is present. Since the nearest apple is at (12, 2), and you are at (9, 2), you would need to move to that location to reach it. However, the apple is only *available* if the river is clean — which it currently isn’t, because there's no dirt to clean. This creates a paradox: apples require clean river conditions, but

Moving from (7, 6) towards (13, 6).
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 6). You see agent 1 at (7, 7).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

You are at (7, 6). Agent 1 is at (7, 7) — directly adjacent, so there's potential for coordination or conflict, but since the goal is to maximize points via apple consumption, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), we must consider whether any dirt exists and whether cleaning is necessary.

Global scan says: **"Nearest Dirt: None found."** This is critical.

That means:
- There is currently no dirt on the map (or at least, no dirt detected in the global scan).
- Therefore, **apples are already spawning**, because apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., no dirt).
- So, **no cleaning is required** — there's no dirt to clean, and thus no need to perform a cleaning action to enable apple spawning.

Now, the two key decisions:
1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   The nearest apple is at (13, 6), which is 6 units away. You can reach it, but you must move step by step (no diagonal movement).

Moving from (8, 7) towards (13, 7).
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (1, 1). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 2 at (2, 0).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Here's the reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available at (1, 0), just one step away. Eating it gives a direct +1.0 reward with no risk or cost.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 0), which is 7 units away — far beyond the current reach. Cleaning it would require significant movement and time, and there’s no indication that any apples will spawn until the river is clean. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and we are not currently in a position to clean dirt efficiently, this action is not immediately beneficial.
- Agent 2 is at (2, 0), which is adjacent to the apple. If agent 2 is also trying to eat the apple, a race could occur. However, since I can move to (1, 0) before agent 2 can reach it (assuming agent 2 moves only to adjacent cells), I have a slight advantage in claiming the apple.
- There is no immediate benefit to cleaning dirt — it provides no reward and only enables future apple spawning. Given that we are currently at a location where apples are already present, and no other immediate resources or threats are visible, the immediate reward

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 0). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 1 at (1, 1).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Here's the reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only 1 step away — this is a direct, positive reward (+1.0 point) with no risk.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 0), which is 5 steps away. Cleaning it would require significant movement and time, and there is no immediate benefit from doing so — apples only spawn *after* the river is clean, and we don’t know if the current state of the river is far from clean. There’s no indication that cleaning this dirt will result in any apple spawning in the near future.
- Agent 1 is at (1, 1), which is adjacent to the apple. That means they may already be close to an apple or planning to eat one. Since we are in a cooperative cleanup game, helping others is good, but only if it doesn't come at the cost of our own immediate survival or scoring.
- Eating the apple now gives immediate value and improves our score right away. Delaying this action to clean dirt would mean forgoing a guaranteed +1.0 point, which is a clear loss in point accumulation.
- There is no evidence that cleaning dirt will result in more apples in

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 1). You see dirt at (7, 0), dirt at (8, 1) and dirt at (7, 2).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

**Current Position**: (8, 1)  
**Immediate surroundings**: Dirt at (7, 0), (8, 1), and (7, 2)  
**Nearest Apple**: (12, 2), distance = 5  
**Nearest Dirt**: (8, 1), distance = 0 — meaning we are currently standing on dirt  

**Key Rules Reminder**:  
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed).  
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward but is necessary to enable apple spawning.  
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point.  
- Movement is only allowed in cardinal directions (up, down, left, right). No diagonals.

**Option 1: Eat an apple?**  
There is no apple currently visible at (8, 1). The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 steps away.  
To reach it, we must first clear dirt to make the path "land" — because apples only spawn on land.

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (1, 1). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 2 at (2, 0).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Here's the reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only 1 step away — this gives me a direct +1.0 reward with no risk or cost.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 0), which is 7 steps away. Cleaning it would require significant movement and time, and there's no immediate benefit from doing so. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, this is a long-term strategy that doesn't provide value in the current situation.
- There is an agent (Agent 2) at (2, 0), which is adjacent to the apple. If I don’t act now, I risk missing the apple. Also, since the apple is on land and directly accessible, there’s no need to delay action for a future benefit that isn’t guaranteed or visible.
- The rules state that cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward — so it's not a productive action in the short term. Without a clear benefit or threat, it’s not worth sacrificing immediate points for a distant, uncertain future gain.

Therefore, the optimal action is to eat the apple at (1, 0) for immediate +1.0 points. This maximizes my current score and align

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 0). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 1 at (1, 1).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Here's the reasoning:

- The apple is directly adjacent (distance 1), so it's within immediate reach and provides a clear +1.0 reward with no risk.
- There is no immediate threat from Agent 1 at (1, 1), who is just one step above the apple. I can move to (1, 0) safely — it's a single step down or left, but I'm already at (2, 0), so moving to (1, 0) is a left move (valid, no diagonal movement).
- The dirt at (7, 0) is far away (distance 5), and cleaning it would require a long journey with no immediate benefit. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and we don’t currently have any apples spawning due to dirt, cleaning it now would not result in immediate apple generation.
- The trade-off between immediate reward and future benefit is not favorable here: eating the apple gives a direct, tangible point. Cleaning dirt would only help in the future, but we have no current apples and no indication that the river is near critical state.
- There is no indication that the dirt at (7, 0)

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 1). You see dirt at (7, 0) and dirt at (7, 2).
  Thinking: I am at (8, 1). The current observation shows dirt at (7, 0) and (7, 2). The global scan indicates that the nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away, and the nearest dirt is at (7, 0), just 2 units away.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple visible in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 steps away. Eating it would require movement and time. Since we are currently at (8,1), we would need to move to (12,2) — that’s a horizontal move of 4 units right and 1 unit up (total 5 steps). However, there is no apple at (8,1) or nearby. So, **immediate apple consumption is not possible**. Therefore, this option is not viable right now.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   Dirt at (7,0) and (7,2) are both within reach. The dirt at (7,0) is only 2 units away — very close

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (1, 1). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 2 at (2, 0).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available at distance 1 — the closest possible action. Eating it gives me +1.0 point instantly, which directly increases my score.
- There is no visible dirt nearby (the nearest dirt is at (7, 0), 7 units away), so cleaning dirt is not feasible or urgent. The rule states that apples only spawn when the river is clean, but since no dirt is currently near me, and there's no indication that cleaning dirt will yield immediate benefit in this scenario, it's not a priority.
- Agent 2 is at (2, 0), which is adjacent to the apple. If agent 2 is also trying to eat the apple, there could be a conflict. However, since I am at (1, 1) and the apple is at (1, 0), I can reach it in one move (down to (1, 0)) — a move that is safe and efficient.
- There is no information suggesting that cleaning dirt will lead to future apple spawns in a way that outweighs the immediate reward of eating the apple. Given the current state, the apple is the only immediate, tangible reward available.
If I clean the dirt at (6,1), I will improve the river's cleanliness, which will eventually allow apples to spawn on land. This creates a foundation for future apple availability. Since apples are the only source of points, and I can only get them when the
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 3). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: The current observation shows that I am at (6, 3), with no immediate visible interest. The global scan reveals:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 7 units away — a significant distance.
- The nearest dirt is at (6, 1), just 1 unit below me, meaning it's directly accessible.

Now, analyzing the trade-offs:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There are no apples visible or nearby. The nearest apple is far away, and eating one would require moving to (12, 2) — a long path. Since no apple is in immediate range, this option is not viable or efficient. Moreover, apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning they are not available unless dirt is cleaned. Thus, eating an apple now is impossible.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   This is critical. Dirt must be cleaned to allow apples to spawn. The nearest dirt is at (6, 1), just one step away. Cleaning it would make apples more likely to appear in the future, which benefits the group. Since apples are the only source of points, enabling their spawning is a long-term strategic necessity. Even

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 7). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision.

Currently, I am at (7, 7). The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 6 units away — a reasonable distance. However, apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, meaning that cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apple generation. The nearest dirt is at (6, 1), which is 7 units away — not extremely far, but still a significant journey.

Let’s evaluate the trade-offs:

1. **Eat an apple immediately?**  
   Eating an apple gives +1.0 point, which is immediate and valuable. However, since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and we currently have dirt present, the apple at (13, 7) may not be available to us *unless* the river is clean. That means the apple might not be a guaranteed spawn — it might be a temporary or conditional item. If we eat it now, we get a point, but we risk losing future opportunities if the apple is not actually spawnable due to dirt.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apples?**  
   Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it is essential for apples to spawn. If we

--- Step 34 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 0). You see dirt at (6, 1).
  Thinking: Given the current situation, I need to carefully analyze the trade-off between immediate reward and long-term benefit.

**Current Observation**:  
- I am at (6, 0).  
- There is dirt at (6, 1), just one step away.  
- The nearest apple is at (13, 0), 7 steps away.  
- There are no apples currently visible in the immediate vicinity.  

**Key Rules**:  
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed).  
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward.  
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point.  
- Movement is only allowed in cardinal directions (up, down, left, right).  

**Analysis**:

1. **Should I eat an apple?**  
   → There is **no apple at (6, 0)** or nearby. The nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 7 steps away and currently unreachable due to the dirt at (6, 1) blocking access to cleaner land.  
   → Eating an apple would require being at a location where one exists. Since no apple is currently accessible, **eating one is not possible**.  
   →
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 2). You see dirt at (6, 1).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 1).

Here's the reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible in immediate proximity. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 steps away — far from immediate reach.
- The only dirt visible is at (6, 1), just one step away. This is the closest dirt to me, and cleaning it would directly improve the river's cleanliness.
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. So, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple spawning — without it, apples won't appear, even if we move toward them.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 reward, but there are no apples available in the immediate vicinity. The apple at (12, 2) is too far to reach without first ensuring the river is clean, and even then, we’d need to walk through potentially dirty areas.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning. Since apples are the only source of points and they depend on a clean river, this action is strategically necessary.
- The game likely rewards long-term progress over short-term gains. By cleaning the dirt now, I’m investing in the future availability of apples —

Moving from (6, 7) towards (6, 1).
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 7). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: At (6, 7), the nearest apple is at (1, 8), which is 6 units away — a significant distance. The nearest dirt is at (6, 1), also 6 units away. This means there's no immediate apple within reach, and no dirt is nearby either.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple visible or accessible at the current location. The nearest apple is far away and requires movement. Eating an apple would require reaching it, which is not feasible without first navigating. Since no apple is in immediate vicinity, this option is not viable now.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   Dirt cleaning is essential for apples to spawn — the river must be clean to have apples. However, the dirt at (6, 1) is 6 units away, and we are currently at (6, 7). That means we would have to move down to (6, 1) to clean it. While cleaning dirt doesn’t give immediate reward, it enables future apple spawning, which benefits the group. Since apples are currently not spawning (no apples visible), cleaning dirt is a necessary long-term investment to make apple

--- Step 35 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 0). You see dirt at (6, 1).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 1).

Here's the reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 7 units away — far beyond a simple immediate action.
- The dirt at (6, 1) is the nearest dirt patch, just one step away. Cleaning it will improve the river's cleanliness, which directly increases the chance of apples spawning in the future.
- Eating an apple now is not viable because no apple is within reach — the nearest one is at (13, 0), requiring a long path, and there's no indication that apples are currently spawning due to clean water.
- Cleaning dirt provides no immediate reward, but it is a necessary prerequisite for apple spawning. Without cleaning dirt, apples won’t appear, even if they’re nearby.
- Since the goal is to maximize points over time (not just immediate gains), and apples only spawn when the river is clean, investing in cleaning now is a strategic move.
- Moving to (6, 1) to clean it is a minimal cost (one step) with high long-term benefit.

Therefore, the optimal action is to clean the dirt at (6, 1) to
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 0).

Reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible or nearby in a way that would justify immediate consumption. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — far enough that it's not practical to eat now without a clear path or intermediate resources.
- The dirt at (7, 0) is immediately adjacent and only 1 unit away — this is the closest dirt patch to my current position.
- According to the rules, apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. This means cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple spawning. Without cleaning, no apples will appear, even if I walk far.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 point, but it would be a wasted opportunity if it doesn't lead to more apples or long-term benefit. Since apples are not spawning now, and the dirt is right next to me, cleaning it enables future apple generation — which benefits the group and increases the potential for more rewards down the line.
- There is no immediate danger or obstacle, and movement is restricted only to cardinal directions. I can safely move to (7, 0) and clean it.

Therefore, the optimal strategy is to clean
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 5). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the current situation and make a strategic decision based on the rules and goals.

Current position: (6, 5)  
Nearest apple: (13, 6) — distance 8  
Nearest dirt: (6, 7) — distance 2  

Key facts:
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed).
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward but is necessary to enable apple spawning.
- Movement is only allowed in cardinal directions (up, down, left, right), no diagonals.

Now, evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple immediately?**  
   The nearest apple is 8 units away — that’s a long distance. There’s no apple visible or nearby. Since the apple at (13,6) is far away and not accessible without first ensuring the river is clean, and since apples don’t spawn unless the river is clean, it’s likely that the apple at (13,6) will not be available unless dirt is cleaned. Therefore, eating an apple now is not feasible — there is no apple in reach.

2. **Clean the dirt at (

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (3, 0). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to determine the best course of action.

Currently, I am at (3, 0). The nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 10 units away — quite far. The nearest dirt is at (7, 0), just 4 units away. Since I can't move diagonally, movement is constrained to horizontal or vertical paths.

Key points:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed). So, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward but enables future apple spawning, which benefits the group (and potentially me in the long run).
- There are no visible objects or immediate rewards nearby — I see nothing of interest.

Now, consider the trade-off:

1. **Eat an apple?**  
   The nearest apple is 10 units away — I would have to travel 10 steps to reach it. Since I'm at (3,0), I'd have to go to (13,0), which is far and may not be accessible if the path is blocked or if the river is dirty. Moreover, apples

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 0). You see dirt at (7, 0).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 0), and the current observation shows dirt at that exact location. The nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 6 units away — a significant distance. There is no apple currently visible or accessible, and the only dirt is right where I am standing.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There is no apple at (7, 0). I cannot eat an apple here. The nearest apple is 6 steps away, and it's not currently spawnable because the river is not clean. Eating an apple is only possible when one is present. Since no apple is visible or accessible, this option is not viable.

2. **Clean the dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   → This is critical. Dirt blocks apple spawning. The rule states that apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt). Since we are currently at (7, 0) with dirt, and this is the nearest dirt, cleaning it will make the area clean — which is a prerequisite for apples to appear.  
   → Even though cleaning gives no immediate reward, it enables future apple spawning. Given that the nearest apple is

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 6). You see dirt at (6, 7).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 7).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (13, 6), which is 7 units away. That means it's far out of reach in a single path, and even if I could reach it, there's no immediate apple nearby to eat.
- The dirt at (6, 7) is only 1 unit away — very close. This is the nearest dirt, and cleaning it will directly contribute to making the river cleaner, which increases the chance of apples spawning in the future.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean. So, cleaning dirt is not immediately rewarding, but it's essential for enabling future apple spawns. This supports the group's long-term goals.
- There is no nearby apple (within a reasonable distance) that I can eat immediately. The only apple is 7 units away, and I don't have a path or access to it without first cleaning the dirt that may be blocking or limiting future access.
- Since I cannot move diagonally, my movement is constrained to cardinal directions. Moving from (6,6) to (6,7) is valid and efficient — just one step up.
- Cleaning dirt is a necessary precondition for apple spawning

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (4, 0). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 0).

Reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 9 units away. That means it's far from my current position (4, 0), and even if I could reach it, there's no immediate apple spawn nearby.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 0), just 3 units away — a very short distance. Cleaning dirt is not rewarding in itself, but it's essential for enabling apple spawning in the future.
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Since the current state has dirt present, no apples can spawn — even if I move to (13, 0), apples won’t appear unless the river is clean.
- Therefore, cleaning the dirt at (7, 0) is a necessary prerequisite for future apple availability. Without it, the group will be unable to gain apples, regardless of how far or how many apples are located.
- Eating an apple now is not viable — there is no apple in immediate range, and even if there were, it would be far away and not accessible without first cleaning the river.
- Since I cannot move diagonally, I must move in straight lines. Moving from

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 0). You see agent 3 at (5, 0).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the current situation and make a strategic decision based on the game rules and objectives.

Current position: (7, 0)  
Agent 3 is at (5, 0) — directly to the left, same row.  
Nearest apple: at (13, 0), distance = 6 units (along the x-axis).  
Nearest dirt: at (6, 7), distance = 8 units (diagonally, but movement is restricted to cardinal directions).

Key constraints:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed).
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward but enables future apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.
- You cannot move diagonally — so movement is only up, down, left, right.

Now, evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple at (13, 0)?**  
   - Distance is 6 — feasible.  
   - Immediate reward: +1.0.  
   - But the apple is far from any dirt.  
   - However, apples only spawn when the river is clean — so if dirt remains, no apples appear.

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the current situation and make a strategic decision based on the game rules and objectives.

**Current Observation:**
- I am at (7, 3)
- Agent 2 is at (7, 2) — directly above me
- There is dirt at (7, 4) — directly to my right
- Nearest apple is at (12, 2), 6 steps away
- The nearest dirt is only 1 step away — at (7, 4)

**Key Rules to Consider:**
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is removed)
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but enables future apple spawning
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately
- Movement is only allowed in cardinal directions (up, down, left, right) — no diagonals

**Trade-off Analysis:**

1. **Eat an apple now?**
   - The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 steps away — I cannot reach it immediately.
   - There are no apples visible in the immediate vicinity (only dirt at (7,4)).
   - Therefore, I cannot eat an apple now — no apple

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see dirt at (8, 1) and agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully and make a strategic decision based on the rules and goals.

Currently, I am at (7, 2). The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — that’s a significant distance. There’s dirt at (8, 1), which is only 2 units away (distance = √((7-8)² + (2-1)²) = √(1+1) = √2 ≈ 1.41), so it’s very close. 

Key facts:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but enables future apple spawning (which benefits the group).
- I cannot move diagonally — so movement is restricted to cardinal directions.

Now, evaluating the options:

1. **Eat an apple** — There are no apples visible in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which requires traveling 5 steps. Since I’m at (7, 2), I’d have to go east to (12, 2).

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4), dirt at (6, 5) and dirt at (7, 6).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4), not eat an apple.

Reasoning:

- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Right now, there is dirt at (7, 4), (6, 5), and (7, 6). This dirt is blocking apple spawning, so cleaning it is essential to enable future apple growth.
- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 steps away. Even if I could reach it, apples do not spawn unless the land is clean. Therefore, eating an apple now would be futile — it's not possible to spawn apples in dirty areas.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it is a prerequisite for future apple spawning. This is a necessary investment for long-term points.
- The dirt at (7, 4) is only one step away from my current position (7, 5), making it the most accessible and urgent dirt to clean. Cleaning it will directly improve the chances of apples appearing on adjacent land.
- There is no immediate benefit to eating an apple when no apples are currently spawning due to dirt. Doing so would waste a valuable action with no return.

Therefore, the optimal action is to clean the dirt at (7

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (8, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am at (7, 3). Agent 2 is at (8, 2), which is diagonally adjacent — but I cannot move diagonally, so I must move one step at a time in cardinal directions (up, down, left, right). The dirt is at (7, 4), directly north of me. That's only one step away. 

The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 steps away — quite far. However, apples only spawn when the river is clean, meaning dirt must be cleaned to allow apples to appear. Right now, there is dirt at (7, 4), and no apples are visible in the immediate vicinity. 

So, should I eat an apple? There are no apples visible near me — the nearest is at (12, 2), far away. Eating an apple would give +1.0, but I don’t currently have one. So this option is not viable.

Should I clean the dirt at (7, 4)? Yes — because cleaning dirt enables future apple spawning. This is a long-term strategy. Even though it gives no immediate reward, it increases the probability of

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 4 units away. That means I would need to travel at least 4 steps to reach it — a significant distance, especially if I don’t have a clean path or if apples don’t spawn until the river is clean.
- Right now, there is dirt at (8, 1), just one step away from my current position (8, 2). Cleaning this dirt would directly improve the river’s cleanliness, which increases the chance of apples spawning in the future.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — so without cleaning dirt, even if I reach the apple, it won’t appear. This means eating an apple now is not feasible, because the apple at (12, 2) won't spawn unless the river is clean.
- Therefore, the immediate reward of eating an apple is not possible — no apples are currently available due to the dirty river.
- Cleaning the dirt at (8, 1) is the most efficient action: it costs no immediate reward but enables future apple spawning, which benefits the group (including me).
- Since I cannot move diagonally, I

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4), dirt at (6, 5) and dirt at (7, 6).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision for maximizing points and contributing to the group's success.

Current position: (7, 5)  
Visible dirt: (7, 4), (6, 5), (7, 6)  
Nearest apple: (2, 5), distance = 5  
Nearest dirt: (7, 4), distance = 1  

Key facts:
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be removed to enable apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately, but apples don’t spawn unless dirt is cleaned.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning, which benefits the group and increases long-term points.
- I am currently at (7,5), and the closest dirt is at (7,4) — just one step away. That’s very close and easy to reach.

Now, evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple** — The nearest apple is at (2,5), which is 5 steps away. That would require moving to (2,5), which is far from current position and would leave me with no immediate dirt-cleaning opportunity. Since there

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see dirt at (8, 3) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision.

Current position: (7, 3)  
Visible dirt: (8, 3) and (7, 4)  
Nearest apple: (12, 2), distance = 6  
Nearest dirt: (8, 3), distance = 1  

Let’s break down the options:

1. **Eat an apple**  
   - Immediate +1.0 point.  
   - But apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be removed.  
   - There is no apple currently visible at (7,3), and the nearest apple is 6 units away.  
   - Eating an apple now would give a short-term reward, but if there are no apples nearby, it's a wasted action.  
   - Since apples don’t spawn unless the river is clean, and we have dirt right next to us (distance 1), we are not in a clean state.  

2. **Clean dirt**  
   - Dirt at (8,3) and (7,4) are directly adjacent.  
   - Cleaning (8,3) is only 1 step away — very efficient.  
2. **Cleaning dirt** at (7, 7) gives no immediate reward, but it’s essential for enabling future apple spawning. Since apples only appear when the river is clean, cleaning this dirt would increase the likelihood of apples
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 7}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 4). You see agent 1 at (7, 5).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am at (7, 4), and I see Agent 1 at (7, 5) — directly adjacent to me, so there's potential for conflict or coordination. The nearest apple is at (4, 6), which is 5 units away — a significant distance. The nearest dirt is at (7, 7), which is only 3 units away. That means I can reach the dirt in just three steps (up to (7, 7)) — very accessible.

Now, consider the trade-offs:

1. **Eating an apple for immediate reward**:  
   The nearest apple is far away (distance 5), and I have no apple in sight. There is no apple at my current position or nearby. Eating an apple would require movement and would only give +1.0 point. But since apples only spawn *when the river is clean*, and we currently have dirt present, apples are not spawning yet. So, eating an apple now would be a wasted action — no immediate benefit, and it doesn’t help the long-term goal of enabling future apple spawns.

2. **Cleaning dirt to enable future apple spawns**:  
   This is critical. The
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 7}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (13, 6). You see an apple at (13, 5), an apple at (14, 5) and an apple at (12, 7).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (13, 5).

Here’s the reasoning:

- The apple at (13, 5) is directly adjacent and within one step — the closest apple to my current position. Since apples provide +1.0 points each and there is no immediate reward for cleaning dirt, the immediate benefit of eating an apple is clear and tangible.
- The dirt at (7, 7) is far away (distance 7), and cleaning it would require a significant journey with no immediate benefit. Moreover, apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt cleaning is a prerequisite for future apple spawning. However, since we already have apples available now, and the goal is to *maximize points*, acting on immediate, available rewards is more efficient.
- There’s no indication that cleaning dirt will result in more apples in the near term — especially given the current state where apples are already present. The trade-off between immediate reward and future potential is not favorable here because the future benefit is uncertain and delayed.
- Moving toward the dirt at (7, 7) would require traversing multiple steps, potentially missing nearby apples. Since the apple at (13, 5) is within reach and the game rewards immediate consumption, it

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 6). You see agent 2 at (7, 5) and dirt at (7, 7).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to determine the best course of action.

Current position: (7, 6)  
Agent 2 is at (7, 5) — directly adjacent, so there’s potential for interaction or competition.  
There is dirt at (7, 7) — just one step away, so it's very accessible.  
Nearest apple is at (4, 6), which is 3 steps away — not immediately close.  
The rule states: apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed). So, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apple spawning.

Let’s evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   The nearest apple is at (4, 6), which is 3 steps away. To reach it, I’d need to move left or up/down to get there. But there’s no apple currently visible in my immediate vicinity. Eating an apple would require movement, and since apples only spawn when the river is clean, I can’t assume apples are available now. Also, the apple at (4,6) is not spawning — it’s just a location. So, unless there’s an apple already present, I cannot eat
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 7}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see agent 1 at (7, 6).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision for maximizing points and contributing to the group's success.

Current position: (7, 5)  
Agent 1 is at (7, 6) — directly north of me, so we're in the same column.  
Nearest apple is at (4, 6), which is 4 units away (3 steps west, 1 step north).  
Nearest dirt is at (7, 7), which is only 2 units away (1 step north).  

Key considerations:

1. **Immediate reward vs. long-term benefit**:
   - Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately, which is valuable.
   - However, apples only spawn *when the river is clean* (i.e., when dirt is removed). So, if we don’t clean dirt, apples won’t appear — even if we're close to one.
   - The nearest dirt is at (7,7), just one step north of me. That’s very close. Cleaning it would immediately enable apple spawning in the area (especially since the nearest apple is at (4,6), which is on the same row as the dirt at (7,7), suggesting a possible river path).
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 7}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (13, 5). You see an apple at (13, 5) and an apple at (14, 5).
  Thinking: I am at (13, 5), and I see apples at (13, 5) and (14, 5). The nearest apple is directly in front of me, at distance 0 — meaning I can eat it immediately and gain +1.0 point. This is a clear, immediate reward with no risk.

However, the global scan shows that the nearest dirt is at (7, 7), which is 8 units away. Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apples to spawn in the future — but only after the river becomes clean. Since apples currently spawn *only when the river is clean*, and we are currently at (13, 5) with apples already present, the system is already in a state where apples are spawning (because we have apples now). 

The key insight: **apples are already spawning**, meaning the river is currently clean enough. Therefore, the dirt at (7, 7) is not currently affecting apple availability. Cleaning it may not yield immediate benefits, and since we are already in a state with apples present, there's no urgent need to clean dirt *right now*.

Furthermore, cleaning dirt takes time and effort — moving from (13, 5) to (7,

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 7). You see agent 2 at (7, 6) and dirt at (7, 7).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 7).

Here's the reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible in my immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (4, 6), which is 4 steps away — far enough that eating it would not provide immediate utility.
- The dirt at (7, 7) is directly adjacent to me. Cleaning it would improve the river's cleanliness, which in turn increases the likelihood of apple spawning in the future — especially since apples only spawn when the river is clean.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 point, but there’s no apple available at (7, 7) or nearby. The apple at (4, 6) is out of reach unless I move through the dirt and make progress.
- Cleaning dirt has no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning — which is critical for long-term point accumulation and group success.
- Since I cannot move diagonally, moving to (7, 6) (where agent 2 is) may not help unless I can coordinate with them. However, I don’t have any information about agent 2’s intentions or whether they are also cleaning or eating.
- The trade-off is between immediate reward (0 apples nearby) and
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see dirt at (8, 3) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am currently at (7, 3). I observe dirt at (8, 3) and (7, 4). The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 steps away. The nearest dirt is at (8, 3), just 1 step away — meaning it's very close and directly accessible.

Now, let’s evaluate the trade-offs:

1. **Eat an apple?**  
   There is no apple visible in immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 steps away — far from where I am. Eating an apple would require movement and would not yield immediate benefit given the distance and lack of nearby apples. Also, apples only spawn when the river is clean — so without cleaning dirt, apples won't appear. Therefore, eating an apple now is not feasible or beneficial.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   This is critical. Dirt must be cleaned to allow apples to spawn. The dirt at (8, 3) is only 1 step away — the closest possible. Cleaning it would directly contribute to enabling apple spawning in the future. Since apples

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 1). You see dirt at (6, 0), dirt at (8, 0) and dirt at (8, 1).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

You are currently at (8, 1).  
You observe dirt at (6, 0), (8, 0), and (8, 1).  
The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 steps away.  
The nearest dirt is at (8, 1) — you're standing on it, so you're already at a dirt location.

Key rule: **Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when there is less dirt).**  
So, cleaning dirt is essential to enable apple spawning — it’s a prerequisite for future rewards.  
But cleaning dirt gives **no immediate reward** — it’s purely a setup action.

Now, consider the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   - There is no apple currently visible or accessible at your position.  
   - The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 steps away.  
   - To reach it, you’d have to move through potentially dirty terrain.  
   - You cannot eat an apple unless you are on land *with* an apple.  
   - Since no apple is currently in your vicinity (and

  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4), dirt at (6, 5) and dirt at (7, 6).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am currently at (7, 5). The observation shows dirt at (7, 4), (6, 5), and (7, 6). The global scan indicates that the nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 steps away. The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), just 1 step away — meaning it's very close and accessible.

Now, evaluating the trade-offs:

1. **Should I eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple visible in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is 5 steps away, and there’s no indication that any apple is currently spawning because the river is not clean. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), and we currently have dirt present, there are no apples available to eat now. Eating an apple would require movement to (2, 5), which is far and currently inaccessible due to dirt blocking the path or lack of clean land. Therefore, **eating an apple is not possible right now** — it would be a futile action.

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 3). You see dirt at (8, 3), dirt at (6, 4), dirt at (7, 4) and agent 3 at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I am at (8, 3), and the current observation shows that there is dirt at (8, 3), (6, 4), and (7, 4), with Agent 3 currently located at (7, 4). The global scan confirms that the nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — a significant distance. The nearest dirt is at (8, 3), meaning I am directly on top of it.

Let’s evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple visible at (8, 3) or nearby. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is far away and currently inaccessible due to dirt blocking the path. Eating an apple would require being at a location where one exists — and none are currently available. Therefore, **eating an apple is not possible right now**. This option yields zero reward and is not viable.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   This is critical. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be removed. Currently, dirt exists at (8, 3), (6, 4), and (

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 1). You see dirt at (6, 0) and dirt at (8, 0).
  Thinking: I am at (8, 1). The nearest dirt is at (8, 0), which is only one step away — directly below me. This dirt is immediately accessible and requires no long journey to clean. Cleaning it would improve the river's cleanliness, which in turn increases the chance of apples spawning in the future. 

Currently, there are no apples visible in my immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 steps away — a significant distance. Given that apples only spawn when the river is clean, and we currently have dirt present, I cannot assume apples will appear without first cleaning the dirt.

Now, evaluating the options:

1. **Eating an apple** — There are no apples in my current or nearby vicinity. Eating one would give +1.0 immediately, but there's no apple to eat now. So this option is not viable.

2. **Cleaning dirt** — The dirt at (8, 0) is adjacent and directly reachable. Cleaning it would improve the river's condition, increasing the likelihood of apples spawning later. This is a necessary step to enable future apple generation, especially since the nearest apple is far away and dependent on clean conditions.

  Thinking: I am at (7, 4), and the current observation shows that there is dirt at (7, 4), (6, 4), and (6, 5), with agent 1 also located at (8, 3) — which is currently covered in dirt. The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 units away. The global scan confirms that the nearest dirt is at (7, 4), meaning I am already standing on dirt.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple visible in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is far away (6 steps). To reach it, I’d have to move through multiple dirt patches and potentially risk getting blocked or delayed. Eating an apple now is not possible — no apple is within reach. Therefore, this option is not viable.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   This is critical. Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be removed from the area. The dirt at (7, 4), (6, 4), and (6, 5) are all within my immediate

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 3). You see dirt at (6, 4) and agent 3 at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am at (8, 3). The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — a moderate distance. The nearest dirt is at (8, 0), which is only 3 units away — very close. There is also agent 3 at (7, 4), which is adjacent to me, suggesting possible interaction or competition.

Now, let's evaluate the trade-offs:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   - Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.  
   - However, apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned). Right now, there is dirt at (8, 0), and no indication that it has been cleaned.  
   - Since apples don’t spawn unless the river is clean, and we are currently in a state where dirt exists, **apples are not currently available** — even if I move toward (12, 2), there's no guarantee of spawning.  
  Obs: You are at (8, 7). You see agent 3 at (8, 6).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

You are at (8, 7). Agent 3 is at (8, 6), directly above you — suggesting possible coordination or competition, but no direct threat is indicated. The key data points:

- **Nearest Apple**: at (13, 7), distance = 5. This is reachable, but not immediately adjacent.
- **Nearest Dirt**: *None found* in the global scan.

This is critical. **There is no dirt to clean**, so the action of cleaning dirt — which is necessary to enable apple spawning — is not feasible right now. Therefore, **option 2 (cleaning dirt)** is not actionable and cannot yield future apples.

Now, consider the trade-off:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   The apple at (13, 7) is 5 units away. You can reach it, but it requires movement. Since there's no dirt to clean, and apples only spawn *when the river is clean*, the apple at (13, 7) may not exist unless dirt is cleaned first. But the global scan says the apple *is* at (13, 7), and it's listed as "nearest" —
  Decision: {'action': 'move_to', 'args': {'coord_x': 13, 'coord_y': 7}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (10, 2). You see an apple at (12, 2).
  Thinking: Given the current situation:

- You are at (10, 2).
- There is an apple at (12, 2), which is just 2 steps away (a simple right move).
- The nearest dirt is *not found* in the global scan — meaning there is currently no dirt to clean.
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned). Since no dirt is visible, no apples are currently spawning — but the apple at (12, 2) *already exists*, so it must have been there before or is a standalone apple that doesn't require dirt to be present.

Important clarification: The rule says apples spawn *only when the river is clean*. But the apple at (12, 2) is already present. This suggests either:
- The apple is a pre-existing one (not dependent on current dirt state), or
- The river is already clean in this region (even if not explicitly scanned), or
- The "dirt" is not in the immediate vicinity and may be elsewhere.

However, the global scan says "Nearest Dirt: None found," which implies no dirt is currently detectable — so there’s no dirt to clean. Therefore, **

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 6). You see agent 1 at (8, 7).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

You are at (8, 6). Agent 1 is at (8, 7), directly above you — possibly a potential coordination point or a threat depending on behavior, but no hostile action is mentioned, so we assume neutral.

**Key facts from the global scan:**
- Nearest Apple: at (13, 6), distance = 5. That’s a reachable apple — you can move to it in 5 steps (rightward: (8,6) → (9,6) → (10,6) → (11,6) → (12,6) → (13,6)).
- Nearest Dirt: None found.

This is critical: **There is no dirt to clean.** Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning. However, if there is *no dirt* in the map, then cleaning is not possible — so the "future apple" benefit is zero.

Therefore, **option 2 (cleaning dirt)** is not viable — it cannot be done, and thus does not contribute to the group’s long-term apple potential.

  Obs: You are at (9, 7). You see agent 3 at (9, 6).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

Current position: (9, 7)  
Agent 3 is at (9, 6) — directly adjacent, so we are in close proximity.  
Global scan shows:
- Nearest apple is at (13, 7), distance = 4.
- **No dirt is found in the global scan.**

This is critical: **There is no dirt present** in the environment according to the global scan. That means:
- There is **no dirt to clean**, so the "clean dirt to enable apple spawning" action is **not applicable**.
- Therefore, **option 2 (cleaning dirt)** is not viable — it cannot be done, and thus offers no benefit.

Now, option 1: **Eat an apple for immediate reward**.  
- The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 4 steps away.  
- Since we can only move in cardinal directions (no diagonals), we would need to move right to (10,7), then (11,7), (12,7), (13,7) — that’s 4 moves.

- You are at (11, 2).
- There is an apple directly adjacent at (12, 2) — distance 1.
- The nearest dirt is **not found** in the global scan, which means there is currently no dirt to clean.
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt has been cleaned). Since no dirt is present, apple spawning is currently not triggered — but the apple at (12, 2) exists, suggesting that apples can appear even without dirt? Or perhaps the apple is a static or pre-existing one.

But the rule says: *Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (less dirt = more apples)*. This implies that **apples are conditional on cleanliness**, but the presence of an apple at (12, 2) suggests either:
- It's a pre-existing apple (not dependent on dirt), or
- Dirt has already been cleaned in the area (even if not visible in the global scan).

However, the global scan says: *"Nearest Dirt: None found"*, which suggests no dirt is currently visible or in range. That would imply no cleaning is possible — and thus no apples should

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (9, 6). You see agent 1 at (9, 7).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

You are at (9, 6). Agent 1 is at (9, 7), directly above you — possibly a potential coordination point or a threat, depending on context. However, the key information is in the **global scan**:

- **Nearest Apple**: at (13, 6), distance = 4.  
- **Nearest Dirt**: *None found*.

This is critical. There is **no dirt** in the global scan. That means:
- There is **no dirt to clean** → no immediate benefit from cleaning.
- Since apples only spawn **when the river is clean**, and there is currently **no dirt**, the river is already clean (or at least, no dirt exists to make it dirty).
- Therefore, **apples are already possible to spawn** — or at least, they are available *now*.

So, the trade-off between:
1. Eating an apple for immediate +1.0 reward,  
2. Cleaning dirt to enable future apples (which is not possible since no dirt exists),  
3. Exploring elsewhere (since no dirt to clean and apple is at (13,6)) —

Moving from (10, 7) towards (13, 7).
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (10, 7). You see dirt at (8, 6) and agent 3 at (10, 6).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the trade-off carefully based on the current situation.

Current position: (10, 7)  
Nearest apple: (13, 7) — distance 3  
Nearest dirt: (8, 6) — distance 3  
Agent 3 is at (10, 6), directly below me, which suggests possible coordination or competition.

Key facts:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning cleaning dirt is necessary to enable future apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediate reward.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward but enables future apple spawning, which benefits the group.
- I cannot move diagonally — so movement is constrained to cardinal directions (up, down, left, right).

Now, the trade-off:
1. **Eat an apple at (13, 7)** — immediate +1.0 reward. Distance is only 3, so it's reachable in 3 moves (e.g., right to (11,7), then (12,7), then (13,7)). This is a clear, accessible reward.
-

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 0). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 1 at (1, 1).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only one step away — a direct, zero-risk action that gives me +1.0 point immediately.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 0), which is 5 steps away. Cleaning it would require significant movement and time, and there is no immediate benefit to doing so — apples don’t spawn until the river is clean, and we don’t know if any other apples will appear or if the dirt is even accessible in a way that would be efficient.
- There is no indication that the dirt cleaning will result in a greater number of apples or that the group needs it urgently. Without a clear future apple spawn dependency, cleaning it now is a long-term, speculative investment with no immediate payoff.
- Agent 1 is at (1, 1), which is adjacent to the apple — suggesting they may also be able to eat it. However, since I can move to (1, 0) without conflict and gain a point immediately, and there's no rule preventing me from eating it before others, it is a safe and rational choice.
- In a cleanup game where immediate rewards are available and future rewards are uncertain, maximizing immediate points is
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 1, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 1). You see dirt at (7, 0) and dirt at (7, 2).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 1), with dirt at (7, 0) and (7, 2). The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — a significant distance. The nearest dirt is at (7, 0), just 1 unit away, meaning I can reach it immediately.

Let’s evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward**:  
   There is no apple currently visible at my position. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which requires moving right and up. Since I am at (7, 1), I would need to go to (7, 2) first (to avoid dirt), then move right to (12, 2). But there is no apple at (7, 1) or nearby. So, eating an apple is not immediately available. This option yields zero reward now and delays progress.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning**:  
   Dirt at (7, 0) is only 1 step away — I can clean it immediately. Cleaning dirt has no direct reward, but it improves the environment: when the river is clean (less dirt), apples spawn more frequently. Since apples

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (1, 1). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 2 at (2, 0).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only 1 step away — this gives me a direct +1.0 reward with no risk or cost.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 0), which is 7 steps away. Cleaning it would require significant movement and time, and there is no indication that apples will spawn or become available before then. In the absence of any nearby dirt or visible apple spawn conditions, cleaning dirt is not a priority.
- There is no immediate threat from Agent 2 at (2, 0), and they are not blocking the path to the apple. The path from (1,1) to (1,0) is clear and safe.
- The rule states that apples only spawn when the river is clean — but that is a long-term condition. Since we are currently in a state where apples *are already present*, we should take advantage of them before investing energy in future, uncertain outcomes.
- In a cleanup game, immediate rewards should be prioritized when available, especially when the long-term benefit (future apples from cleaning dirt) is not guaranteed or accessible in the short term.

Therefore, the optimal action is to eat the apple at (1
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 1, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 0). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 1 at (1, 1).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Here’s the reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only 1 step away. Eating it gives a direct +1.0 point, which is a clear and immediate reward with no risk.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 0), which is 5 steps away — far from the current location. Cleaning it would require significant movement and time, and there’s no indication that dirt cleaning will spawn apples soon or that it’s necessary for any immediate benefit.
- There is no apple spawning condition being met currently (apples only spawn when the river is clean), and since the river isn’t currently clean, there’s no immediate apple spawning threat or benefit.
- Agent 1 is at (1, 1), which is adjacent to the apple at (1, 0). That suggests the apple might be a shared resource, and if I don’t eat it now, another agent might. Since I’m Agent 2, I have a strategic advantage in acting first — eating the apple now maximizes my immediate score and prevents someone else from claiming it.
- There is no urgent need to clean dirt to enable future apples — the global scan shows dirt is far away and not currently affecting the
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 1, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 0). You see dirt at (7, 0).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 0), and I see dirt at that exact location. The nearest apple is at (1, 0), which is 6 units away — a significant distance. There is no apple currently visible or reachable in a direct path, and the only dirt is right where I am.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There is no apple at (7, 0). I am standing on dirt, not on an apple. Eating dirt would not yield any points, and apples are not available here. So, this option is invalid. I cannot eat an apple immediately.

2. **Clean the dirt at (7, 0)?**  
   → This is a valid action. Cleaning dirt has no immediate reward, but it’s essential because apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. The dirt at (7, 0) is blocking the ability to have apples spawn in that area. By cleaning it, I’m enabling future apple spawning — possibly on adjacent land later. Since the nearest apple is 6 units away, and we have no apples yet, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for any apple growth in the future. This action supports the group's long-term

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (1, 1). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 2 at (2, 0).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Here's the reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available at (1, 0), just one step away. Eating it gives a direct +1.0 reward with no risk or delay.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 2), which is 7 units away. Cleaning that dirt would require a long journey and provides no immediate benefit. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, cleaning dirt is a long-term, indirect action — it doesn't help now and doesn't guarantee immediate apple access.
- There is no immediate threat or obstruction from Agent 2 at (2, 0). While they are adjacent, there's no indication of conflict or danger — and moving toward them would only block access to the apple if we were in a defensive or competitive scenario, which isn't suggested.
- The goal is to maximize points. Immediate action with a clear reward (eating the apple) is more efficient than investing time in a distant, uncertain task (cleaning dirt).
- There is no apple nearby that requires cleaning dirt to appear — the apple at (1, 0) is already present and accessible.

   → This is a critical step. Dirt at (8,1) is only 1 step away — I can reach it in one move. Cleaning it will improve the river's cleanliness, which increases the chance of apples

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4), dirt at (6, 5) and dirt at (7, 6).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4) — not eat an apple immediately, and not explore blindly.

Here’s the reasoning:

- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Right now, there is dirt at (7, 4), (6, 5), and (7, 6). Dirt blocks apple spawning, so cleaning it is essential to enable future apple growth.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 4), which is just one step away from my current position (7, 5). This is a very low-effort, high-impact action — I can move to (7, 4) and clean it immediately.
- Eating an apple at (2, 5) is tempting due to the immediate +1.0 reward, but that apple is 5 steps away, and the path to it is likely blocked or obstructed by dirt. Moreover, if the river remains dirty, apples won't spawn at all — so long-term goals are undermined.
- Cleaning dirt doesn't give immediate points, but it enables future apple spawning. Since the nearest apple is far away and dependent on clean land, the group’s ability to earn points in the future hinges on cleaning dirt.
- There's no

--- Step 35 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (8, 2) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to decide the best course of action.

Current position: (7, 3)  
Agent 2 is at (8, 2) — not directly threatening, but nearby.  
There is dirt at (7, 4), which is only 1 step away.  
Nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 steps away — quite far.  
The key rule: apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is removed). So, cleaning dirt enables future apple spawning, which benefits the group.  

Now, evaluating the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   - The nearest apple is 6 steps away.  
   - There are no apples visible in immediate vicinity (only dirt at (7,4)).  
   - Eating an apple requires being at an apple location — we are not currently at one.  
   - So, we cannot eat an apple now.  
   → This option is not viable.

2. **Clean the dirt at (7,4)?**  
   - Distance to dirt: 1 step (from (7,3) to (7,4)) — very close.  
   - Cleaning

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 2). You see dirt at (8, 1) and agent 1 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (8, 1).

Reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 4 units away — far enough that immediate consumption would not be efficient or rewarding in the short term.
- There is dirt directly adjacent to me at (8, 1), just one step away. Cleaning it is a low-effort, high-impact action that directly contributes to improving the environment.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning that cleaning dirt enables future apple spawning. This is a critical prerequisite for long-term rewards.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0, but only if an apple is present. Since no apple is visible nearby (and the nearest is at (12,2), requiring a long path), there’s no immediate apple to eat.
- By cleaning the dirt at (8,1), I enable the possibility of apples appearing in the area, which benefits not only myself but the group — aligning with the cooperative goal of maximizing total points over time.
- I cannot move diagonally, so I can only go to (8,1) or (7,2), (9,2), etc. The dirt at (8,1) is
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4), dirt at (6, 5) and dirt at (7, 6).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 4) — not eat an apple immediately.

Here's the reasoning:

- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Currently, there is dirt at (7, 4), (6, 5), and (7, 6). This dirt prevents apple spawning in those areas, even if they are adjacent to land. The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away — far from any immediate dirt. But without cleaning the dirt, the land remains contaminated and apples won’t spawn, meaning no future apple access.

- Eating an apple now would give +1.0, but it would be a short-term gain with no long-term benefit. The apple at (2,5) is already far away and likely inaccessible due to the current dirt state. There’s no indication that any apple is currently spawning — only that apples *can* spawn when the river is clean.

- Cleaning dirt is a necessary precondition for apple spawning. Since the nearest dirt is at (7,4), which is just one step away from my current position (7,5), I can reach it in one move. Cleaning it will reduce the dirt in that area, improving the chances of

--- Step 36 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see dirt at (8, 3) and dirt at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am at (7, 3). I observe dirt at (8, 3) and (7, 4). The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 steps away. The nearest dirt is at (8, 3), just 1 step away — very close.

Key points:
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Dirt blocks apple spawning.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but enables future apple spawning — crucial for long-term points.
- I cannot move diagonally, so movement is constrained to cardinal directions.

Right now, there is dirt directly in front of me at (8,3) — just one step away. If I clean that dirt, I remove a barrier to apple spawning. Since the nearest apple is 6 steps away, and I'm currently blocked by dirt at (8,3), cleaning that dirt would open a path toward the apple and also improve the environment for future apple generation.

Eating an apple immediately would give +1.0 point, but:
- The apple at (12,2) is far away.
- There's no apple currently visible or accessible — no apple
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 3}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 1). You see dirt at (6, 0), dirt at (8, 0) and dirt at (8, 1).
  Thinking: I am at (8, 1), and my current observation shows that there is dirt at (6, 0), (8, 0), and (8, 1). The global scan confirms that the nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — quite distant. The nearest dirt is at (8, 1), which is at my current position, meaning I’m standing directly on dirt.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple visible at my current position. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is far away and requires movement. Eating an apple would require reaching it, which means first clearing dirt or moving through the environment. Since no apple is currently spawnable (apples only spawn when the river is clean, i.e., when dirt is removed), and I’m currently on dirt, there is no apple available to eat *right now*. Therefore, eating an apple is not possible immediately — it would require a sequence of actions.

2. **Clean dirt to ensure future apples spawn?**  
   This is critical. Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be removed. Currently
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4), dirt at (6, 5) and dirt at (7, 6).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully and make a strategic decision based on the game rules and current state.

Current position: (7, 5)  
Visible dirt: (7, 4), (6, 5), (7, 6)  
Nearest apple: (2, 5) — distance 5  
Nearest dirt: (7, 4) — distance 1  

Key rules:
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed).
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but enables future apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.
- Movement is only allowed in cardinal directions (up, down, left, right), no diagonals.

Now, evaluating the options:

1. **Eat an apple immediately?**  
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 2). You see dirt at (6, 1).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 1).

Here's the reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible in immediate range. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — far from immediate reach.
- The dirt at (6, 1) is directly adjacent and only 1 unit away. Cleaning it is a simple, low-cost action that will improve the environment for future apple spawning.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when there is less dirt). So, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apples to appear — without it, even if we walk to (12, 2), no apples will spawn.
- Eating an apple now would give a +1.0 reward, but there are no apples nearby to eat. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which would require a full path through potentially dirty terrain and is not accessible until the river is clean.
- Since we are at (6, 2), moving to (6, 1) to clean dirt is a single, straightforward step. This action has no immediate cost and enables future apple generation.
- Cleaning dirt supports the group’s long-term goal — enabling apple spawning — which is
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 6). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision for maximizing points while supporting the group's long-term success.

Currently, I am at (6, 6). The nearest apple is at (13, 6), which is 7 units away — a significant distance. There's no immediate apple visible nearby, and I see nothing of interest in the current view. That suggests that eating an apple immediately is not feasible — no apple is in range to consume right now.

The nearest dirt is at (6, 1), which is only 5 units away — directly above me. This is a critical point because apples only spawn when the river is clean, meaning dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning. Since apples are currently not spawning (due to dirt), cleaning this dirt will eventually allow apples to appear, including the one at (13, 6). 

Now, evaluating the options:

1. **Eat an apple**: There is no apple in immediate range. The nearest is 7 units away, and I can't move diagonally. So, I would need to walk to (13, 6) — a long journey — and even then, I can't eat it unless it's present. Since apples don’t spawn until

--- Step 36 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 0). You see dirt at (6, 1).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 1).

Reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 7 units away — far beyond an immediate reach.
- The dirt at (6, 1) is the nearest dirt, just one step away. Cleaning it will improve the river's cleanliness and enable apple spawning in the future.
- Eating an apple now is not feasible because no apple is within reach. Even if apples were nearby, they only spawn when the river is clean — so without cleaning dirt, apples won’t appear regardless of movement.
- Cleaning dirt provides no immediate reward, but it's essential for enabling future apple spawning, which directly supports the group's goal of maximizing points.
- Since I cannot move diagonally, I must move step-by-step. From (6, 0), I can move to (6, 1) to clean the dirt — a simple, valid action.

Therefore, the optimal strategy is to clean the dirt at (6, 1). This action sets the foundation for future apple spawns, which will eventually allow me to collect apples and gain points. Without this, no apples will appear, and I will be unable to

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 2). You see dirt at (6, 1).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 1).

Here's the reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible in immediate range. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 steps away — far enough that immediate apple consumption isn't viable or efficient.
- The dirt at (6, 1) is only 1 step away, meaning it's directly adjacent and easily accessible.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple generation. Without cleaning, no apples will appear, even if we move toward the distant apple.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 point, but there are no apples available at the current location. We are at (6, 2), and the only visible apple is 6 steps away, not within reach.
- Cleaning dirt does not give immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning. This is a strategic investment in long-term sustainability.
- Since we can only move in cardinal directions (not diagonally), moving to (6, 1) to clean is a simple, low-effort action with high strategic value.

Therefore, the optimal decision is to clean the dirt at (6, 1). This ensures the river
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 5). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision.

Currently, I'm at (6, 5). The nearest apple is at (13, 6), which is 8 units away — quite far. There's no visible apple nearby, and I see nothing of interest in the immediate vicinity. The nearest dirt is at (6, 1), which is only 4 units away — directly above me. This means I can reach it in just a few moves (up 4 units), and cleaning it would help enable future apple spawning, especially since apples only appear when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed).

Now, evaluating the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple in sight, and the nearest is 8 units away. Eating it would require significant movement and time. Since I’m not currently near any apple, this option gives no immediate benefit and would delay progress toward cleaning dirt or reaching apples in the future.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   This is a strategic long-term move. Dirt removal is not rewarding in itself, but it's essential for apples to spawn. Since apples only appear when the river is clean, removing

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 0). You see dirt at (6, 1).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 1).

Here’s the reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 7 units away — far from reach, especially since we can’t move diagonally and would need to traverse a potentially dirty path.
- The dirt at (6, 1) is the nearest dirt patch, just one step away. Cleaning it will improve the river's cleanliness, which directly increases the chance of apples spawning in the future — especially in areas like (13, 0) or nearby land.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 point, but there are no apples available at the current position. The apple at (13, 0) is not accessible without first cleaning the river (which requires clearing dirt).
- Cleaning dirt provides no immediate reward, but it is a necessary prerequisite for apple spawning. Without cleaning, apples won’t spawn — so the long-term reward is much higher.
- Since the dirt is adjacent and easy to reach, cleaning it is a low-effort, high-impact action that enables future apple spawning.

Therefore, the optimal strategy is to clean the dirt at (6, 1).
   - Since the dirt is at
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 7}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 7). You see dirt at (6, 7).
  Thinking: I am at (6, 7), and I see dirt at that exact location. There are no apples visible in my immediate vicinity — the nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 7 units away. There is no dirt elsewhere in the global scan, so (6, 7) is the only dirt currently present.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple** – There is no apple at (6, 7), and the nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is far away. Eating an apple would require movement and would not be possible immediately. So, **no immediate apple is available to eat**. Attempting to eat an apple now would result in zero reward and could waste movement.

2. **Clean the dirt at (6, 7)** – This is the only dirt present. Cleaning it would make the river "cleaner" at that point. According to the rules, apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. So, by cleaning this dirt, I am enabling future apple spawning — potentially allowing apples to appear at (6, 7) or nearby, especially if the river’s cleanliness increases. This is a **long-term investment** with no immediate reward
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 7}} -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (5, 0). You see agent 1 at (7, 0).
  Thinking: I am at (5, 0), and I see Agent 1 at (7, 0). The nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 8 units away — a significant distance. The nearest dirt is at (6, 7), also 8 units away. 

Let’s analyze the trade-offs:

1. **Eating an apple for immediate reward**:  
   There are no apples visible in my immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is far away (8 units), and there is no indication of any apple spawning in the current environment. Eating an apple would require moving to (13, 0), which is not only far but also requires first ensuring the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned) to even allow apple spawning. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and currently there's dirt present, apples are not spawning. Therefore, **there is no apple available to eat right now**. Attempting to move toward it without cleaning dirt would be futile — the apple won't spawn until dirt is cleaned.

2. **Cleaning dirt to enable future apple spawning**:  
   The dirt at (6, 7) is 8 units away — not immediately adjacent. However, cleaning it is necessary

Moving from (7, 0) towards (13, 0).
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 0). You see agent 3 at (5, 0).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

**Current Position:** (7, 0)  
**Agent 3 Position:** (5, 0) — directly to the west, adjacent.  
**Nearest Apple:** (13, 0), distance = 6 units (6 steps east).  
**Global Scan:** No dirt found in the global scan.  

This is critical: **There is no dirt visible in the global scan.** That means there is no dirt to clean — so cleaning cannot happen. Therefore, **option 2 (cleaning dirt to enable future apples) is not possible right now.**

Now, consider the trade-off:

1. **Eat an apple?**  
   - The nearest apple is at (13, 0), 6 steps away.  
   - To reach it, you must move east from (7, 0) to (13, 0).  
   - However, apples only spawn *when the river is clean*.  
   - Since there is **no dirt** in the global scan, the river is already clean.  
   - So, **apples can spawn** — meaning apples *are available* now.  
   - Therefore, **eating an apple is possible and
  Decision: {'action': 'move_to', 'args': {'coord_x': 13, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Moving from (6, 7) towards (13, 7).
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 7). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: Given the current observation and global scan, let's analyze the situation carefully.

You are at (6, 7).  
The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 7 units away — a significant distance.  
Crucially, the global scan states: **"Nearest Dirt: None found."** This is a key detail.  

This means:
- There is **no dirt** in the environment currently, so **no cleaning action is needed**.
- Since apples only spawn **when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed)**, and there is currently **no dirt to clean**, there is **no mechanism to generate apples** through cleaning.
- Therefore, **cleaning dirt is not an actionable option right now** — it would be futile or premature.

Now, regarding the two decision options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There is **no apple visible nearby**, and the nearest apple is 7 units away at (13, 7).  
   → Eating an apple requires being *at* an apple. Since you're not at one, you can't eat one immediately.  
   → Even if you move to (13, 7), you
  Decision: {'action': 'move_to', 'args': {'coord_x': 13, 'coord_y': 7}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (5, 0). You see agent 1 at (7, 0).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

Current position: (5, 0)  
Agent 1 is at (7, 0) — very close, likely on the same row.  
Nearest Apple: at (13, 0), distance = 8 units.  
Nearest Dirt: **None found** in the global scan.

This is critical: **There is no dirt to clean.** That means:

- Cleaning dirt is not an option right now.  
- Therefore, **no immediate benefit from cleaning** can be gained.  
- Apples only spawn *when the river is clean*, but since there's no dirt to clean, apples cannot spawn — even if we move toward them.

So, the trade-off options become:

1. **Eat an apple** — but there are no apples visible or accessible near us. The nearest is 8 units away, and we have no dirt to clean to enable apple spawning. Without clean river conditions, apples won’t appear.  
   → **No apple can be eaten immediately** because the spawning condition isn’t met. Eating an apple would require one to be present — and none are currently available.

2. **Clean dirt** — but the global scan says "No dirt found." So this

Moving from (8, 0) towards (13, 0).
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 0). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: Given the current observation and global scan, let's analyze the situation carefully.

You are at (8, 0).  
The nearest apple is at (13, 0), 5 units away — directly to the east.  
There is no dirt visible in the global scan, meaning no dirt is currently detectable in the environment.  

Now, evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   - Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.  
   - However, the apple at (13, 0) is 5 units away — you would need to move there to reach it.  
   - There is no indication that apples spawn unless the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned).  
   - Since there is *no dirt* currently in the global scan, the condition for apple spawning is already met (zero dirt = clean river).  
   - Therefore, apples *can* spawn now, and the apple at (13, 0) is available.  
   - So, eating it is a valid, immediate action with no risk of missing future rewards.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   - Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward.
  Decision: {'action': 'move_to', 'args': {'coord_x': 13, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Moving from (7, 7) towards (13, 7).
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 7). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

You are currently at (7, 7).  
The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 6 units away — directly to the east.  
The global scan shows **no dirt nearby** — meaning there is no dirt to clean.  

This is critical: **Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean**. So, if there is no dirt to clean, there is no immediate way to enable apple spawning.  

Now, evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There is an apple at (13, 7), 6 units away. But you currently see nothing of interest nearby, and no dirt is present.  
   → Eating an apple requires movement to reach it. However, since no dirt exists, there's no immediate benefit to cleaning — and no apples will spawn anyway unless dirt is cleaned.  
   → So, eating an apple is possible, but **only if you can reach it**. There's no reason to believe that apple will be there permanently — it may be temporary or dependent on clean land.  
   - Removing dirt improves the river
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 3}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 1). You see dirt at (6, 0), dirt at (8, 0) and dirt at (8, 1).
  Thinking: I am at (8, 1), and the current observation shows dirt at (6, 0), (8, 0), and (8, 1) — all of which are adjacent to my position. The global scan confirms that the nearest apple is at (12, 2), 5 units away, and that the nearest dirt is at (8, 1), which is where I currently am. This means I am already standing on dirt — and there is no apple currently visible nearby.

Let’s break down the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple visible at (8, 1) or in immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 steps away. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), and there is currently no clean land, no apples can spawn yet. Therefore, **eating an apple is not possible now** — attempting to do so would result in failure or no reward.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   This is critical. Dirt removal is a prerequisite for apple spawning. The current dirt at (6, 0), (8

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 4), dirt at (6, 5) and dirt at (7, 6).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am at (7, 5). The immediate surroundings have dirt at (7, 4), (6, 5), and (7, 6). The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away — a significant distance. There is no apple in immediate range, and the only apples are far away, meaning I cannot eat one right now.

The global scan shows that the nearest dirt is at (7, 4), just one step away — very close. Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning, and apples only appear when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt). So, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple generation.

Now, evaluating the trade-offs:

1. **Eat an apple?**  
   There is no apple nearby. The nearest apple is 5 steps away, and I have no information suggesting any apple is currently spawnable. Eating an apple would require moving to (2, 5), which is far and may not be worth it if no apples are currently available. Also, if I don't clean dirt, apples won't spawn at all — so this option is not viable now.

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 3). You see dirt at (8, 3), dirt at (6, 4), dirt at (7, 4) and agent 3 at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I am at (8, 3), and the current observation shows that there is dirt at (8, 3), (6, 4), and (7, 4), with Agent 3 located at (7, 4). The global scan indicates that the nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — quite distant. The nearest dirt is at (8, 3), meaning I am already standing on dirt.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple visible at my current position (8, 3). Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned to create land. Since we are currently on dirt, and no apple is present, I cannot eat an apple immediately. Therefore, this option is not viable right now.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   This is critical. Dirt must be cleaned to allow apples to spawn. The current dirt at (8, 3) is directly under me — I can clean it. Cleaning it would convert that spot into land, which could then spawn an apple (if the river becomes clean enough). This action has no

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 1). You see dirt at (6, 0) and dirt at (8, 0).
  Thinking: I am at (8, 1). The global scan shows that the nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — a moderate distance. However, there is dirt at (6, 0) and (8, 0), and the nearest dirt is at (8, 0), just 1 unit away. That means I can reach it immediately.

Now, let’s analyze the trade-off:

1. **Eating an apple for immediate reward**:  
   There are no apples visible in immediate proximity (within one move), and the nearest apple is 5 units away. Eating an apple would require moving to (12, 2), which is not feasible without first cleaning dirt. Also, apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be removed. So, without cleaning dirt, apples won’t appear. Therefore, eating an apple now is not possible.

2. **Cleaning dirt to enable future apple spawning**:  
   The dirt at (8, 0) is directly adjacent to my current position (8,1). I can move to (8,0) and clean it. This action has no immediate reward, but it is essential for enabling apples to spawn in the future. Since

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 4). You see dirt at (8, 3), agent 1 at (8, 3), dirt at (6, 4), dirt at (7, 4) and dirt at (6, 5).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 4), and the current observation shows that there is dirt at (7, 4), (6,4), (6,5), and (8,3) — with agent 1 also present at (8,3). The global scan indicates that the nearest apple is at (2,5), which is 6 units away. The nearest dirt is at (7,4), where I currently am.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple visible in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (2,5), which is 6 steps away — far beyond immediate reach. Eating an apple would require movement and time, and there's no apple at (7,4) or nearby. Therefore, **eating an apple is not feasible now**. The immediate reward is not available.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   Dirt must be cleaned to allow apples to spawn. Currently, I am standing on dirt at (7,4), which is the nearest dirt. Cleaning it would be a necessary step to eventually enable apple spawning — especially since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt

--- Step 38 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 3). You see dirt at (6, 4) and agent 3 at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the current situation and the trade-offs between immediate reward and long-term benefit.

**Current Position**: (8, 3)  
**Immediate surroundings**:  
- Dirt at (6, 4) — directly adjacent (one step left and one up)  
- Agent 3 at (7, 4) — just to the left of me, at (7,4)  
- Apple at (12, 2) — 5 steps away (distance) — not immediately accessible  
- Nearest dirt globally is at (8, 0) — 3 steps down  

**Key insight**: Apples only spawn *when the river is clean*, which means dirt must be cleaned. The presence of dirt at (6,4) is a local obstacle — if I clean it, it will contribute to a cleaner river and potentially enable apple spawning in the future.  

**Option 1: Eat an apple**  
- There is no apple in immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (12,2), which is 5 steps away.  
- To reach it, I’d have to move through potentially dirty or obstructed terrain.  
- Eating an apple requires being *on land* and *in proximity*
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 0). You see dirt at (6, 0) and dirt at (8, 0).
  Thinking: I am at (8, 0), and the current observation shows dirt at both (6, 0) and (8, 0). The global scan indicates that the nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 5 units away — a significant distance. The nearest dirt is at (8, 0), meaning I'm already standing on dirt.

Let’s analyze the trade-offs:

1. **Should I eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple currently visible or accessible at (8, 0). The nearest apple is at (13, 0), which requires moving right along the x-axis. Since I’m at (8, 0), I’d need to move to (9, 0), (10, 0), etc., to reach (13, 0). But there is no indication of an apple spawning yet — apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed). Since dirt is present at (8, 0) and (6, 0), the land is currently contaminated, and thus, no apples are spawning. Therefore, **eating an apple is not possible right now** — no apple is available to consume.

  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 7}} -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 6). You see dirt at (7, 7) and agent 1 at (7, 7).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to make the best decision.

Currently, I am at (7, 6). There is dirt at (7, 7), which is directly adjacent to me. Agent 1 is also at (7, 7), so they are both present at that location. The nearest apple is at (4, 6), which is 3 units away — a reasonable distance but not immediate.

Let’s break down the options:

1. **Eat an apple** — The nearest apple is at (4, 6), which requires movement to reach. Since I'm at (7, 6), I'd need to move left to (6,6), then (5,6), then (4,6) — a 3-step path. But there's no apple visible at (7,6) or nearby. So, I cannot eat an apple immediately. This option is not viable right now.

2. **Clean the dirt at (7,7)** — This is directly adjacent to me. Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning in the future, and it's a group benefit. However, cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward. But the global scan shows that apples only spawn when the river is clean — implying
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 7}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (13, 5). You see an apple at (14, 5).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (14, 5).

Reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only one step away — this is a direct, positive action with a clear +1.0 reward.
- There is no immediate benefit to cleaning dirt at (7, 7), which is 8 units away. Cleaning dirt provides no immediate reward and is a long-term investment that only pays off if apples eventually spawn, which is uncertain and not guaranteed.
- The current situation offers a tangible, immediate gain with no risk. There is no indication that future apple spawning is dependent on immediate cleanup actions.
- Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is reduced), and the dirt is far away, the probability of spawning more apples in the near term is low. Therefore, the opportunity cost of not eating the apple is high — missing a guaranteed +1.0 point.
- In a cleanup game where both individual and group rewards matter, it's reasonable to prioritize immediate rewards when they are available and accessible, especially when the long-term benefits are uncertain and far off.

Thus, eating the apple maximizes immediate points and is a rational, optimal first move. Cleaning dirt should be deferred until after the agent has established a stable,

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 7). You see agent 2 at (7, 6).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

You are currently at (7, 7), and Agent 2 is at (7, 6) — directly adjacent. This suggests proximity to others, which may be important for coordination, though no explicit rules about cooperation are given. The immediate goal is to maximize points via apples (+1.0 each), but apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apple generation.

### Key Facts:
- **Nearest Apple**: (4, 6) — distance = 4 steps.
- **Nearest Dirt**: (7, 1) — distance = 6 steps.
- Apples do **not spawn** when dirt is present; only when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is removed).
- Cleaning dirt gives **no immediate reward**, but enables future apple spawning.
- You cannot move diagonally — so movement is restricted to cardinal directions (up/down/left/right).

### Trade-off Analysis:

**Option 1: Eat an apple immediately**
- The nearest apple is at (4,6), 4 steps away. You can reach it in 4 moves.
- Eating it gives +1.0 point immediately.
- However, if you eat it now, you are
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Moving from (7, 6) towards (4, 6).
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 6). You see agent 1 at (7, 7).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision for maximizing points and contributing to the group's success.

I am currently at (7, 6), and I see Agent 1 at (7, 7) — directly adjacent. This means there's a potential for interaction or conflict, but since the rules don't specify penalties for proximity or interaction, I should focus on what's strategically optimal.

Key facts from the global scan:
- The nearest apple is at (4, 6), which is 3 units away — reachable in 3 moves (since no diagonal movement is allowed).
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 1), which is 5 units away — a significant distance.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed). So, cleaning dirt is necessary to enable future apple spawning — a long-term benefit.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately, which is a clear short-term reward.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward but enables future apple spawns — a long-term, indirect benefit.

Now, evaluating the trade-off:

1. **Should I eat an apple?**  
   The apple at (4, 6) is only 3 steps away.
  Decision: {'action': 'move_to', 'args': {'coord_x': 4, 'coord_y': 6}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (14, 5). You see an apple at (14, 5).
  Thinking: I am at (14, 5), and there is an apple directly at my current position — distance 0. This means I can immediately eat it and gain +1.0 point.  

Let’s analyze the trade-offs:

1. **Eat the apple now**:  
   - Immediate reward: +1.0 point.  
   - No risk — the apple is already in reach.  
   - This action does not affect the river’s cleanliness or future apple spawning.  
   - Given that apples only spawn when the river is clean, and we currently have no dirt nearby to clean, the immediate benefit of eating an apple is clear.  

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apples**:  
   - The nearest dirt is at (7, 1), which is 11 units away.  
   - Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, only long-term benefit.  
   - Since there’s no indication that future apples will be available otherwise, and we currently have an apple right here, delaying action to clean dirt would mean missing out on immediate points.  
   - Moreover, the dirt is far away — moving to (7, 1) would require a long path, and there's no guarantee that cleaning it will result in more apples

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 6). You see agent 2 at (6, 6).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 1) to improve the river's cleanliness and enable future apple spawning.

Here's my reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (4, 6), which is 3 units away — reachable, but requires movement. However, apples only spawn when the river is clean. Currently, there's dirt at (7, 1), 5 units away. This dirt is a key obstacle to apple spawning.
- Eating an apple now (at (4, 6)) gives a +1.0 immediate reward, but if we don’t clean the dirt, future apple spawning will be blocked. Since apples are the only source of points, and we can't get more without cleaning, the long-term benefit of enabling future apple spawns outweighs the immediate gain.
- Cleaning dirt has no direct reward, but it's essential for enabling future apple growth. Since apples are the only scoring mechanism and they depend on a clean river, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for sustainable point accumulation.
- Agent 2 is at (6, 6), adjacent to me at (7, 6). While that might suggest coordination, there's no indication of conflict or shared goals. Without communication, the best individual strategy is to maximize personal and
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'up'
   - Therefore, **eating an apple now is not possible** because there is no apple visible in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (1
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 0). You see dirt at (6, 0) and dirt at (8, 0).
  Thinking: I am at (8, 0), and the current observation shows that there is dirt at both (6, 0) and (8, 0). The global scan indicates that the nearest apple is at (13, 0), 5 units away, and the nearest dirt is at (8, 0), which is 0 distance — meaning I'm already standing on dirt.

Let’s analyze the trade-off:

1. **Should I eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple visible at my current location. The nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 5 units away. To reach it, I would need to move east along the river (since movement is restricted to cardinal directions). However, apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning there must be no dirt present. Right now, there is dirt at (8,0), and likely at (6,0) as well. So, unless the dirt is cleaned, no apples will spawn. Therefore, **I cannot eat an apple now** because there is no apple in reach and the terrain is not clean.

2. **Should I clean dirt to ensure future apples spawn (helping the group)?**
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 4). You see agent 1 at (8, 3), dirt at (6, 4) and dirt at (6, 5).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to determine the best course of action.

Currently, I am at (7, 4). The nearest dirt is at (6, 4), which is only one step away — a very close and accessible dirt patch. Cleaning this dirt would improve the river's cleanliness, which in turn increases the chance of apples spawning in the future. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, cleaning dirt is not just beneficial — it's necessary for apple generation.

There is an apple at (2, 5), which is 6 steps away. That means I would need to move through multiple tiles to reach it. However, I have no immediate access to any apple. The only apple in the global scan is far away, and no nearby apples are visible in the current observation. Therefore, eating an apple immediately is not feasible — there is no apple in my immediate vicinity.

Option 1: Eat an apple — not possible right now. There is no apple within reach. Even if one were nearby, it would be a short-term gain with no long-term benefit.

Option 2: Clean dirt — highly strategic. The dirt at (6, 4) is adjacent and directly reachable. Cleaning it will improve the river's condition,

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 2). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 0) to enable future apple spawning.

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 4 units away — a reasonable distance, but it's not immediately accessible without first ensuring the river is clean.
- However, apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Currently, there is dirt at (6, 0), which is 4 units away from my current position (8, 2). This means the river is currently dirty and apples are not spawning.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 point, but it would be a one-time reward with no long-term benefit — and if the river remains dirty, no more apples will spawn, regardless of how many apples I eat.
- Cleaning dirt is not immediately rewarding, but it's essential for future apple spawning. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, cleaning the dirt at (6, 0) will enable apples to appear on land in the future — including at (12, 2) or elsewhere — allowing the group to gain more points over time.
- There's no immediate value in exploring further without first addressing the river's cleanliness. The path to (6
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 0). You see dirt at (6, 0).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully.

I am at (8, 0), and I see dirt at (6, 0). The nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 5 units away — quite far. The nearest dirt is only 2 units away, meaning I can reach it in one move (moving left to (6, 0)).

Right now, there are no apples visible in immediate proximity. The only apple is 5 units away, and it's on land — but land only spawns apples when the river is clean. Since there's dirt present, apples aren't spawning yet.

The key trade-off:
- Eating an apple now would give me +1.0 point, but there is no apple at (8,0) or nearby. The apple at (13,0) is far away and only spawns when the river is clean. So, if I don’t clean the dirt, I won’t be able to spawn apples at all — including the one at (13,0).
- Cleaning the dirt at (6,0) will make the river cleaner, enabling apple spawning. This is a prerequisite for future apple generation. Even though it gives no immediate reward, it enables future rewards
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 4). You see dirt at (6, 4) and dirt at (6, 5).
  Thinking: I am at (6, 4), where there is dirt. The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away. The nearest dirt is at (6, 4), which is directly where I am standing — meaning I am already on a dirt patch.

Key facts:
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. "Clean" here means less dirt — so removing dirt enables apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward but is necessary for future apple spawning.
- I cannot move diagonally — so movement is restricted to up, down, left, right.

Now, analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple?**  
   The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 steps away. To reach it, I’d need to move through potentially dirty terrain. But right now, I'm standing on dirt at (6, 4) and (6, 5). There's no apple visible or immediately accessible. So eating an apple is not possible right now — no apple is in my immediate vicinity. Therefore, **eating an apple is not feasible** at this moment.

2. **Clean dirt to

--- Step 40 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 0) — even though it doesn't give immediate reward.

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away. That’s a significant distance, and since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), there's no apple available *right now* because the dirt is still present.
- The dirt at (6, 0) is only 3 units away — a manageable distance to reach. Cleaning it will improve the river's cleanliness, which will eventually allow apples to spawn in the area.
- Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, *no apples can be eaten until dirt is cleaned*. Therefore, eating an apple now is impossible — there is no apple in range that can be accessed without first cleaning the dirt.
- The immediate reward of eating an apple is not available due to the lack of clean spawn zones.
- Cleaning dirt is a necessary precondition for future apple spawning. It’s a strategic investment in enabling long-term rewards.
- Even though there’s nothing visible nearby, the global scan shows that the dirt is close and directly impacts apple availability. Moving to clean it is the only viable action that enables
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'left'
2. **Clean dirt at (8,6)** — distance is 3, so also reachable. Cleaning it
  Decision: {'action': 'move_to', 'args': {'coord_x': 13, 'coord_y': 7}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (12, 2). You see an apple at (12, 2).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (12, 2).

Reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available at my current position (distance 0), which means I can gain +1.0 point right now with no cost or risk.
- There is no immediate benefit to cleaning dirt at (8, 6) — it's 8 units away, and cleaning it would only enable future apple spawning, which is a long-term benefit.
- Since the goal is to maximize points and apples give direct, immediate rewards, and no other immediate opportunities exist (no nearby dirt to clean, no other apples visible), acting now maximizes my current score.
- The rules state that apples only spawn when the river is clean, but that doesn't mean we must clean dirt before eating an apple — we can eat apples as they appear, and this one is already present.
- There is no indication that cleaning dirt is required before apple spawning in this specific scenario — it's a condition for future spawning, not a prerequisite for existing apples.

Therefore, the optimal action is to eat the apple at (12, 2) for immediate +1.0 point. This is the most efficient and rewarding decision given the current state.
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 12, 'coord_y': 2}} -> Env Action: 'eat'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (10, 6). You see dirt at (8, 6) and agent 1 at (10, 7).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (8, 6).

Here’s the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (13, 6), which is 3 units away — that’s a reasonable distance, but it won’t spawn unless the river is clean. The current dirt at (8, 6) is only 2 units away, meaning it’s within reach. 
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — so cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple spawns. Even though cleaning gives no immediate reward, it enables future opportunities for all agents, including myself and others.
- There is no apple in immediate range (within 1 step) that I can eat right now. The apple at (13,6) is too far to be accessible without first cleaning the dirt blocking the path or enabling spawn conditions.
- Moving to (8,6) to clean is a small, low-risk action that directly improves the environment for future apple generation. It also puts me in a better position to eventually reach the apple at (13,6) once the area is clean.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0, but that apple is not currently available — it only spawns when the river is clean. Since the

--- Step 39 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (11, 7). You see agent 3 at (9, 6), an apple at (13, 6), an apple at (13, 7) and an apple at (13, 8).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (8, 6) — despite the immediate reward from apples being nearby — because the long-term goal is to maximize total points through sustainable apple spawning, not just short-term gains.

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is only 2 steps away. That seems tempting — eating it gives +1.0 immediately. But apples only spawn *when the river is clean*. Right now, there is dirt at (8,6), which is 4 steps away. This dirt is blocking apple spawning. If we don't clean it, no more apples will appear in the future, even if we eat existing ones.

- Cleaning dirt is not rewarding immediately, but it enables future apple spawning. Since apples are the only source of points, and we have no other way to earn points, cleaning dirt is a necessary investment for long-term gains.

- The distance to the dirt (4 steps) is manageable — I can move from (11,7) to (10,7), then (9,7), (8,7), (8,6) to clean it. This path is valid and follows movement rules (no diagonals). After cleaning, the river becomes
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 6}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (12, 2). You see an apple at (14, 1) and an apple at (10, 2).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 3) — even though it's far away and doesn't provide immediate reward.

Here's why:

- Apples only spawn when the river is clean. Right now, there's dirt present, which prevents apples from spawning in general. The global scan shows the nearest dirt is at (7, 3), which is 6 units away. While that seems far, it's the only way to enable future apple spawning.
- The two apples visible — at (14, 1) and (10, 2) — are both on land, but their presence depends on the river being clean. If we don’t clean the dirt, future apple spawns may not happen, and the group’s long-term reward will be limited.
- Eating an apple now (e.g., at (10, 2), which is only 2 steps away) gives a +1.0 immediate reward, but that’s a short-term gain. If we clean the dirt, we're investing in enabling more apples to spawn later — potentially allowing us to collect many more apples in the future.
- Since we cannot move diagonally, the path to (7, 3) will take 6 moves (minimum), and
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 3}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (9, 6). You see dirt at (8, 6) and agent 1 at (11, 7).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (8, 6).

Here’s my reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (13, 6), which is 4 units away — far enough that eating it immediately would not be efficient, especially since apples only spawn *when the river is clean*. This means apples are not available unless dirt is removed.
- Currently, there is dirt at (8, 6), just one step away from me at (9, 6). This dirt is blocking apple spawning — it’s a direct barrier to future apple availability.
- Cleaning this dirt will improve the environment, enabling apple spawning in the future. Since apples spawn only when the river is clean, removing dirt is a prerequisite for gaining apples, even if it takes time.
- Eating an apple now is not viable because no apple is currently visible or accessible near me — the nearest is 4 steps away, and without clean conditions, apples won’t spawn there anyway.
- There is no immediate reward for cleaning, but the long-term benefit is critical: it enables future apple growth, which supports both my own and the group’s goals.
- Agent 1 is at (11, 7), which is not in immediate danger or a threat — no indication of conflict or

Moving from (10, 7) towards (11, 7).
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (10, 7). You see dirt at (8, 6) and agent 3 at (8, 6).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am at (10, 7). The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 3 steps away — reachable via (11,7) → (12,7) → (13,7). That’s a straightforward path. Eating an apple would give me +1.0 immediately, which is a clear reward.

However, the dirt at (8,6) is also just 3 steps away (via (9,6) → (8,6)), and there’s an agent (agent 3) already there. Dirt cleaning is not rewarding directly, but it enables apple spawning — meaning that if the river becomes clean, apples can appear, benefiting the entire group. Since apples spawn *only when the river is clean*, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple generation.

Right now, there’s dirt at (8,6), which is currently blocking apple spawning. If I clean it, I would make the river cleaner and allow apples to spawn in the future. But cleaning dirt takes time and effort with no immediate reward.

The key trade-off:
Therefore, the optimal choice is to eat the apple now. This maximizes immediate
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 1, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 0). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 1 at (1, 1).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Here's the reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only 1 step away — this is a direct, actionable opportunity for a +1.0 reward with no risk.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 2), which is 7 steps away. Cleaning it would require significant movement and time, and there's no guarantee that apples will spawn immediately or that the group will benefit in a way that outweighs the immediate gain.
- Agent 1 is at (1, 1), which is adjacent to the apple at (1, 0). If I eat the apple, I do so safely — agent 1 is not currently in a position to interfere, and there’s no indication of conflict or danger.
- There is no immediate threat or obstacle preventing me from eating the apple.
- The rule states that apples only spawn when the river is clean — but this is a long-term condition. Since we are in a state where apples *are already present*, and we are at a location where one is accessible, the immediate action should be to capitalize on that.

The trade-off between immediate reward and future benefit is not favorable here. The future benefit (more apples via cleaning) is uncertain
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 1, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 0). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully.

Currently, I am at (7, 0). The nearest apple is at (1, 0), which is 6 units away — a significant distance. There is no apple in immediate range, and I see nothing of interest nearby. The nearest dirt is at (7, 2), which is only 2 units away — very close.

Key point: Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. This means that cleaning dirt is not just a side activity — it's a prerequisite for apples to appear at all. Without cleaning dirt, apples won't spawn, regardless of how far they are.

Right now, there is no apple visible, and the nearest apple is far away. That suggests the river is currently dirty (or at least not clean enough) to support apple spawning. Cleaning the dirt at (7, 2) would be a necessary step to enable future apple spawning — including the apple at (1, 0) eventually.

Eating an apple now would give +1.0, but there is no apple nearby, and if the river remains dirty, no apples will spawn in the future. So, eating an apple now would be futile — it would not contribute to long-term progress.

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (1, 1). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 2 at (2, 0).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only 1 step away — this gives me a direct +1.0 reward with no risk or delay.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 2), which is 7 steps away. Cleaning it would require significant movement and time, and there is no immediate benefit from cleaning it — apples only spawn when the river is clean, but we currently have an apple already present.
- Agent 2 is at (2, 0), which is adjacent to the apple. If agent 2 also eats the apple, it would be shared or contested — but since we are not told that agents can't eat the same apple or that there's a shared resource, and since I am at (1,1) and can reach (1,0) in one move, I have a first-mover advantage.
- There is no indication that cleaning dirt is urgent or that future apples are needed now. The global scan shows the nearest dirt is far away, so it's not a pressing priority.
- Eating the apple now provides immediate value, which aligns with maximizing points in the short term — a key goal for agents in this game.

Therefore, I

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 0). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 1 at (1, 1).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only 1 step away — this is a direct, tangible reward (+1.0 point) with no risk.
- I am currently at (2, 0), so moving to (1, 0) is a single left move — a simple, low-effort action.
- There is no immediate threat or obstacle preventing me from eating it. Agent 1 is at (1, 1), which is diagonally adjacent, but since I cannot move diagonally, I can only reach (1, 0) from (2, 0) via a valid orthogonal move. Agent 1 is not blocking my path to the apple.
- The dirt at (7, 2) is far away (distance 7), and cleaning it would require significant travel and time. There is no immediate benefit to cleaning it now — apples only spawn *when the river is clean*, which is a future condition. Since apples are already present and within reach, acting now maximizes immediate points.
- The trade-off between immediate reward and long-term benefit is heavily skewed in favor of immediate action: eating the apple gives a clear, instant point, while cleaning dirt

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 1). You see dirt at (7, 2).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 2).

Here's the reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible nearby — the nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away. Eating an apple now would give a +1.0 reward, but it's not immediately available or accessible in a way that provides immediate benefit.
- The dirt at (7, 2) is only 1 unit away — very close and directly adjacent. Cleaning it is a low-effort, high-impact action that improves the river's cleanliness.
- The rule states that apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. So, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple spawning. Without cleaning, no apples can appear — even if they are far away.
- Since apples are the only source of points, and they only spawn when the river is clean, the only way to ensure future rewards is to clean dirt. This is a necessary investment with no immediate reward, but it enables long-term gains.
- There is no immediate alternative action (like moving to a spot with apples) that would be both safe and beneficial. Moving toward the apple at (12, 2) would require passing through or around dirt, which would require cleaning

  Obs: You are at (1, 1). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 2 at (2, 0).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Here's the reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available at (1, 0), just one step away. Eating it gives me +1.0 point — a clear, tangible reward with no risk.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 2), which is 7 units away. Cleaning it would require a significant journey and provides no immediate benefit. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, cleaning dirt is a long-term, indirect action with no current payoff.
- There is no indication that cleaning dirt would benefit me directly or that agent 2 is in a position to block or interfere with my apple collection. Agent 2 is at (2, 0), which is adjacent to the apple — they could potentially claim it, but there's no rule stating that agents can't eat apples simultaneously or that they take priority.
- Since I can move only in cardinal directions (up, down, left, right), reaching (7, 2) would take at least 6 steps (assuming optimal path), and I would gain no immediate reward during that time. In contrast, eating the apple now gives immediate points and is a low-effort action.
   The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 steps away. That means I would need to move through several tiles to reach it. There’s no apple visible in immediate vicinity. Eating one would require traveling to (2, 5), which is not adjacent. Since I’m at (7,5), and the apple is at (2,5), I would have to go left 5

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 3). You see dirt at (8, 3), dirt at (6, 4), dirt at (7, 4) and agent 3 at (7, 4).
  Thinking: I am at (8, 3), and the current observation shows that there is dirt at (8, 3), (6, 4), and (7, 4), with Agent 3 located at (7, 4). The global scan indicates that the nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away. There is no apple currently visible at my position or nearby — I am standing on dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed).

Let’s analyze the trade-offs:

1. **Eat an apple?**  
   There is no apple at (8, 3) or nearby. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away. Since I am currently on dirt, no apple is available for immediate consumption. Eating an apple would require reaching it, which means first cleaning dirt to make the river clean — and that is not possible until I remove dirt. So, **I cannot eat an apple immediately**. This option is not viable.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   This is critical. Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be removed. The

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 1). You see dirt at (6, 0) and dirt at (8, 0).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the current situation to determine the best course of action.

Current position: (8, 1)  
Visible dirt: (6, 0) and (8, 0)  
Nearest apple: (12, 2), distance = 5  
Nearest dirt: (8, 0), distance = 1  

Key observations:
- There are no apples visible in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 steps away — not immediately accessible.
- There is dirt at (8, 0), just one step away horizontally. This is the closest dirt to me.
- Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning, which is essential for long-term rewards and group benefit.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately, but no apples are currently available to eat.
- Since we are at (8,1), moving to (8,0) to clean dirt is a simple, direct action (one step down).

Trade-off analysis:
1. **Eat an apple?** — There is no apple currently available at my position. The nearest apple is 5 steps away and likely not spawnable until the river is clean. So, no immediate apple can
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 4). You see dirt at (8, 3), agent 1 at (8, 3), dirt at (6, 4), dirt at (7, 4) and dirt at (6, 5).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 4), and my current observation shows that there is dirt at (7, 4), (6,4), (6,5), and (8,3) — with agent 1 already occupying (8,3). The nearest apple is at (2,5), which is 6 steps away. The global scan confirms that the nearest dirt is at (7,4), meaning I’m already standing on dirt.

Let’s analyze the trade-off:

1. **Should I eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple visible at my current location or nearby. The nearest apple is 6 steps away, and there's no indication of any apple spawning nearby due to clean land. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), and no apple is currently available, eating one is not possible immediately. Thus, this option is not viable.

2. **Should I clean dirt to ensure future apples spawn (helping the group)?**  
   Yes — this is critical. Dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning. Currently, I am standing on (7,4), which is dirt. Cleaning it would make that location clean, which could eventually allow an apple

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 3). You see dirt at (6, 4) and agent 3 at (7, 4).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

**Current Position**: (8, 3)  
**Observation**: Dirt at (6, 4), Agent 3 at (7, 4)  
**Global Scan**:  
- Nearest Apple: (12, 2), distance = 5  
- Nearest Dirt: (8, 0), distance = 3  

We are at (8,3). The dirt at (6,4) is within reach — just one step left and one up (to (6,4)) — so it's very close. The dirt at (8,0) is further down, at distance 3, so not as immediately accessible.

**Key Rule**: Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned). Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but enables future apple spawning. So, cleaning dirt is a long-term investment.

**Immediate Reward Option**: Eat an apple at (12,2)?  
- Distance is 5 — not very close.  
- No apple is visible or near the current position.  
- Even if we could reach it, it's far and would require a full path through potentially dirty areas.  
- Since apples only
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 0). You see dirt at (6, 0) and dirt at (8, 0).
  Thinking: I am at (8, 0), and the current observation shows dirt at both (6, 0) and (8, 0). The global scan confirms that the nearest apple is at (13, 0), 5 units away, and the nearest dirt is at (8, 0), which is at distance 0 — meaning I'm already standing on dirt.

Let’s analyze the trade-offs:

1. **Should I eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple currently visible or accessible at (8, 0). The nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 5 units away. To reach it, I’d need to move eastward — but only if the path is clear. However, since the river is currently dirty (dirt at (8,0)), apples do not spawn. This means the apple at (13,0) is not currently available — it only spawns when the river is clean. Therefore, **I cannot eat an apple immediately**, because the condition for apple spawning (clean river) is not met.

2. **Should I clean dirt to ensure future apples spawn?**  
   Yes — cleaning dirt is essential. Dirt blocks apple spawning. By cleaning
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 4). You see agent 1 at (8, 3), dirt at (6, 4) and dirt at (6, 5).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to make the best decision as Agent 3.

Current position: (7, 4)  
Visible dirt: (6, 4) and (6, 5)  
Agent 1 is at (8, 3) — not directly threatening or helpful in immediate terms  
Nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 steps away — quite far  
Nearest dirt is at (6, 4), which is only 1 step away — very close  

Key trade-off:

1. **Eat an apple?**  
   - Apples give +1.0 each — immediate reward.  
   - But no apple is visible nearby. The nearest apple is 6 steps away, and we have no information about apple spawning conditions.  
   - Apple spawning only occurs when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is removed). Currently, there is dirt at (6,4) and (6,5), so apples are not spawning.  
   - Therefore, **no apple is available to eat right now** — we cannot eat one without first cleaning dirt or moving to a location where apples exist.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**

--- Step 39 ---
Moving from (7, 3) towards (6, 4).
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see dirt at (6, 4) and agent 3 at (6, 4).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to determine the best course of action.

I am currently at (7, 3). The nearest dirt is at (6, 4), which is just one step away — a distance of 1 move (not 2 as stated in the global scan, which may be a typo). There is an agent (agent 3) currently at that dirt location. This is significant because dirt cannot be cleaned if occupied — so I cannot clean it directly unless the agent leaves.

The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 steps away. That means I would need to go through a path that likely passes through or near the dirt at (6, 4) to reach it. But if I can't clean the dirt, no apples will spawn, which means the entire apple spawning system is blocked.

Given that:
- Eating an apple now gives +1.0 immediately, but there are no apples visible nearby — the nearest is 6 steps away.
- I cannot eat any apple right now because no apple is in my immediate vicinity.
- Cleaning dirt is necessary for future apple spawning, but I am blocked from doing so because agent 3 is currently occupying (6, 4).

  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 2). You see dirt at (6, 1).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 1).

Reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — a significant distance. There are no apples currently visible nearby, and the only immediate apple source is far off.
- The dirt at (6, 1) is adjacent to my current position (6, 2), so it's within one move to clean. This is a low-effort, high-impact action for enabling future apple spawning.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed). Since apples don't spawn on dirt, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for any apple access in the future.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 point, but there are no apples visible in the immediate vicinity. Without cleaning dirt, future apple spawns are blocked, which means long-term rewards are lost.
- Cleaning dirt doesn't give immediate reward, but it enables the possibility of apples appearing later — which is essential for maximizing points over time.
- Since the dirt is directly adjacent and the apple is far away, it's inefficient to wait for apples to spawn naturally when we can proactively enable their appearance.

Therefore, the optimal action is to clean
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 4). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the trade-off between immediate reward and long-term benefit.

Currently, I am at (6, 4). The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 8 units away — quite far. There is no visible apple nearby, and I see nothing of interest in my immediate surroundings. The nearest dirt is at (6, 1), which is only 3 units away — directly below me. 

Key points:
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately, but apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed).
- Dirt cleaning has no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning — which benefits the group.
- Since there are no apples currently visible nearby, and the nearest apple is far away (8 units), there is no immediate benefit to eating one now.
- The dirt at (6, 1) is very close — only 3 units away — and cleaning it would directly contribute to enabling apple spawning in the future.
- The river's cleanliness determines apple availability, so cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple access.

Therefore, even though eating an apple would give immediate points, there are no apples available to eat at this moment. Without cleaning dirt,

--- Step 38 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 0). You see dirt at (6, 1).
  Thinking: Given the current situation, I need to carefully analyze the trade-offs between immediate reward and long-term benefits.

**Current Position**: (6, 0)  
**Immediate Observation**: Dirt at (6, 1) — just one step away.  
**Global Scan**:  
- Nearest apple is at (13, 0), 7 steps away.  
- Dirt is only 1 step away — very close and accessible.  

**Option 1: Eat an apple immediately**  
- There is *no apple* at (6, 0) or nearby. The nearest apple is 7 steps away.  
- Eating an apple requires being *on* an apple. We are not currently on one.  
- Therefore, this option is not viable.  

**Option 2: Clean the dirt at (6, 1)**  
- Dirt cleaning is necessary to enable apple spawning.  
- The river is currently dirty (dirt at (6,1)), so apples are not spawning.  
- Cleaning this dirt will improve the environment, allowing apples to spawn *in the future* — possibly at (13,0) or nearby.  
- This action has no immediate reward, but it is essential for enabling future apple spawns.
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 2). You see dirt at (6, 1) and agent 3 at (6, 3).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 1).

Reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — a significant distance. Given that apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), there is no immediate apple available at my current position or nearby.
- The dirt at (6, 1) is just one step away (distance 1), making it the most accessible dirt patch. Cleaning it would improve the river's cleanliness, enabling future apple spawning — a critical condition for long-term reward.
- Eating an apple now is not possible because no apple is visible in the immediate vicinity. Even if one were, the global scan shows the nearest is far away, and there's no indication of an apple spawning near me.
- The presence of Agent 3 at (6, 3) doesn’t change the fundamental trade-off — I have no reason to prioritize interaction unless there's a shared goal involving coordination or blocking. Since the goal is to maximize points via apple consumption, and apples depend on clean conditions, I should focus on enabling future apple spawns.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it enables future apples — which is essential for long-term point accumulation.
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 3). You see agent 2 at (6, 2).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to make the best decision as Agent 3.

Current position: (6, 3)  
Agent 2 is at (6, 2) — directly below me, so we're in the same column.  
Nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 7 units away — quite far.  
Nearest dirt is at (6, 1), which is only 1 unit away (down from current position).  

Key points:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed).  
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediate reward.  
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward but enables future apple spawning.  
- Movement is only allowed in cardinal directions (up, down, left, right).  
- There’s no immediate apple nearby — the closest is 7 steps away.  
- The dirt is very close — just one step down to (6, 1).  

Now, evaluate the trade-offs:

1. **Eat an apple?**  
   The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 7 steps away. There's no apple in the immediate vicinity (within 1–2 steps).

--- Step 39 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 0). You see dirt at (6, 1).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 1).

Here’s the reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible in my immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 7 units away — far beyond a simple immediate action.
- The dirt at (6, 1) is directly adjacent and only 1 unit away — very close and accessible.
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. This means that cleaning dirt is not just a side activity — it's a prerequisite for future apple spawning. Without cleaning dirt, no apples will appear, regardless of how far away they are.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 point, but there are no apples available at (6, 0) or nearby. The apple at (13, 0) is not reachable without first cleaning the dirt, and even then, it may not spawn until the river is clean.
- Since the dirt is adjacent and only one step away, cleaning it is a low-cost, high-impact action that enables future apple generation. This supports the group's long-term goal of maximizing apple harvests.
- There is no immediate reward for inaction — the only way to get apples is by first cleaning
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
   → Since apples require clean land to spawn, and no dirt exists now, **the apple at
  Decision: {'action': 'move_to', 'args': {'coord_x': 13, 'coord_y': 7}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Moving from (5, 1) towards (12, 2).
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (5, 1). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

You are at position (5, 1).  
The global scan shows:
- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 8 units away.
- There is **no dirt** visible in the global scan.

This is a critical point: **apples only spawn when the river is clean**, meaning dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning. However, **there is currently no dirt** to clean. That implies the river is already clean — so apples *can* spawn naturally.

But here's the key: **apples are not currently spawning** because they only appear when the river is clean — and if there’s no dirt to begin with, then there's no need to clean. So, in this scenario, **apples may already be available**, or they may be waiting to spawn due to the clean condition.

Yet, the nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is far away — 8 steps. You can’t eat it immediately unless you move there.

Now, consider the trade-off:

1. **Eat an apple now?**  
   → You see nothing of interest nearby. There's no apple in your immediate vicinity. So, eating an apple would require

--- Step 39 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (9, 0). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (8, 3) rather than eating an apple at (13, 0) — despite the apple being within reach.

Here’s why:

- Apples only spawn when the river is clean. The current state shows dirt at (8, 3), which is 4 units away. This dirt is likely blocking apple spawning in the region. Without cleaning it, no apples will appear, even if I move toward (13, 0).
- The apple at (13, 0) is not actually "available" right now — it's only visible because the global scan says so. But if the river isn't clean, apples don't spawn. So eating it would be futile — it may not exist in the first place.
- Cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple spawning. This action supports the group’s long-term goal and enables future rewards. Even though it gives no immediate points, it creates a sustainable system where apples can eventually appear.
- Moving toward (13, 0) without cleaning the dirt is a short-sighted move. It risks wasting effort on a non-existent or unspawning apple.

Therefore, the optimal action is to go to (8, 3) and clean the
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 3}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 7). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to analyze the trade-off carefully based on the current situation and long-term goals.

Currently, I am at (8, 7). The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 5 units away — a reasonable distance, but not immediate. The nearest dirt is at (8, 3), which is only 4 units away vertically — directly below me. This dirt is within easy reach and cleaning it would improve the river’s cleanliness, which in turn increases the chance of apples spawning in the future. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple availability.

There is no immediate apple in sight, and I see nothing of interest nearby. Eating an apple now would give me a +1.0 reward, but it would be a short-term gain with no impact on the system's long-term apple generation. Moreover, if I eat an apple now, I miss the opportunity to clean dirt that will enable more apples to spawn later — which benefits the group.

The key point is: **apples only spawn when the river is clean**. Therefore, cleaning dirt is not just a side task — it's a necessary condition for future apple availability. Without cleaning, even if I walk to (
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 3}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 1). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am at (6, 1). The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 7 units away — quite distant. The nearest dirt is at (8, 3), only 4 units away. This means that cleaning dirt is relatively close and would enable future apple spawning on land when the river is clean.

Key considerations:

- Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately, which is valuable for personal score.
- However, apples only spawn when the river is clean — i.e., when dirt is cleaned. So, without cleaning dirt, no apples will appear, even if I'm close to one.
- The apple at (12, 2) is far away, and there's no indication it's currently spawning. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, if the dirt isn't cleaned, that apple won't be accessible.
- The dirt at (8, 3) is only 4 units away — a short journey. Cleaning it would enable future apple spawning, potentially leading to more apples appearing in the future (e.g., at (12, 2) or elsewhere).
- Since I currently see nothing of interest, and

--- Step 40 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 0). You see dirt at (6, 1) and agent 3 at (7, 1).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am currently at (8, 0). The nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 5 units away. The nearest dirt is at (6, 1), which is only 3 units away. That means I can reach the dirt much faster than the apple. 

However, I must consider the rules: apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned). So, cleaning dirt is necessary to enable future apple spawning — this supports the group's long-term goals. Eating an apple gives immediate +1.0 points, but only if it's already present.

Right now, there is no apple visible at my current position or nearby. The nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is far away and not currently spawning because the river isn't clean. Therefore, I cannot eat an apple immediately — it's not available.

The dirt at (6, 1) is within reach (distance 3), and cleaning it would enable future apple spawning. This action is essential for enabling apples to appear in the future, which benefits the group. Since I cannot eat an apple now, the only meaningful action is
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 6). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (8, 3), even though it doesn't provide immediate reward.

Reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (13, 6), which is 5 units away. That’s a significant distance, and without any dirt being cleaned, apples won’t spawn at all. The rule states that apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning. 
- The dirt at (8, 3) is only 3 units away from my current position (8, 6), making it easily accessible. Moving down to (8, 3) is a simple vertical move — no diagonal movement required.
- Eating an apple immediately (even if available) would be pointless if it's not part of a sustainable strategy. Since apples only spawn after cleaning dirt, the current apple at (13, 6) likely won’t be available in the future unless we clean dirt first.
- Cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple spawning. By cleaning it, I enable the group to eventually harvest apples — which is the primary goal. This action supports long-term success and group objectives.
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 6). You see an apple at (4, 6) and agent 1 at (7, 6).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (4, 6).

Reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only 2 steps away — a short, efficient action that gives a direct +1.0 reward with no risk.
- The nearest dirt is at (6, 2), which is 4 steps away. Cleaning it would require a significant movement cost and provides no immediate benefit. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, it's a future-oriented action with uncertain payoff.
- Agent 1 is at (7, 6), just one step to the right of me. While that might suggest a potential conflict or competition, there's no indication of hostile behavior or immediate threat — and moving toward them would block access to the apple or increase exposure to risk without clear benefit.
- The trade-off between immediate reward and long-term environmental improvement is not favorable here: cleaning dirt takes time and effort with no guaranteed return, especially when apples are already present and accessible.
- Since the apple is spawnable (it's already there), and the river isn't currently dirty enough to trigger apple spawning (which would require cleaning), the apple exists independently of dirt status — meaning we can safely consume it now.

Therefore, the optimal action is to eat the apple at (
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 4, 'coord_y': 6}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Moving from (14, 5) towards (12, 7).
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (14, 5). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to make the best decision given the constraints and goals.

Current position: (14, 5)  
Nearest apple: (12, 7) — distance 4  
Nearest dirt: (7, 1) — distance 11  

Key facts:
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed).
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward but is necessary for future apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.
- Movement is only allowed in cardinal directions (up, down, left, right) — no diagonals.
- The goal is to maximize points.

Now, evaluate the options:

1. **Eat the apple at (12, 7)**  
   - Immediate reward: +1.0 point.  
   - Distance: 4 steps — manageable.  
   - But: This apple may only exist *because* the river is currently clean. If we don’t maintain cleanliness, future apples might not spawn. However, since apples only spawn *when the river is clean*, and we don’t have any dirt in sight currently, it's possible the river is already clean.  
   - Risk: If

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see agent 2 at (5, 6).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the trade-off between immediate rewards and long-term benefits in this cleanup game.

Currently, I'm at (7, 5), and the nearest apple is at (4, 6), which is 4 steps away. That means I'd need to move left and up to reach it. The nearest dirt is at (7, 1), also 4 steps away — directly downward from my current position. 

Key observations:
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately, which is a clear short-term reward.
- Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apples to spawn in the future — but it gives no immediate reward.
- The dirt is at (7,1), which is 4 steps down from me. That’s a direct path: (7,5) → (7,4) → (7,3) → (7,2) → (7,1).
- The apple at (4,6) is farther away (distance 4), but it's not currently spawning because the river isn't clean — the dirt is blocking apple generation.

Important rule: Apples only spawn when the river is clean. Since there's dirt present, no apples are spawning — even if I'm close to one. Therefore,
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (5, 6). You see agent 1 at (7, 5) and an apple at (4, 6).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (4, 6).

Here's the reasoning:

- The apple is immediately adjacent to me at (4, 6), just one step away — this is a direct, low-effort opportunity for a +1.0 point reward.
- The nearest dirt is at (6, 2), which is 5 steps away. Cleaning it would require a significant amount of movement and time, and there's no immediate benefit from doing so — no apples are currently spawning, and the global scan shows only one apple is present, which is already reachable.
- There's no indication that the dirt cleaning will yield additional apples in the near term, and since apples only spawn when the river is clean, the benefit is delayed and uncertain.
- Since I can immediately gain a point by eating the apple, and no immediate group benefit is being lost by doing so (in fact, eating an apple doesn't harm the group's ability to clean or spawn more apples), the action is both efficient and optimal under current conditions.
- The presence of Agent 1 at (7, 5) doesn't threaten me — there's no rule about conflict or blocking, and no indication that they are in my way.

Therefore, the trade-off favors immediate reward
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 4, 'coord_y': 6}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (13, 5). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to make the best decision as Agent 3.

Currently, I am at (13, 5). The nearest apple is at (12, 7), which is a distance of 3 steps away. That means I can reach it in three moves — a relatively short path. Eating an apple would give me +1.0 point immediately, which is a clear, tangible reward.

However, the nearest dirt is at (7, 1), which is 10 steps away. Cleaning dirt is not immediately rewarding, but it's essential for future apple spawning. The rule says apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning cleaning dirt enables apples to appear in the future. So, while I don’t get a reward now, I’m investing effort to enable long-term benefits for the group.

But here's the key trade-off:  
- If I go to clean dirt at (7, 1), I must travel 10 steps — a significant distance.  
- During that time, I'm not eating apples, and I'm not contributing to immediate group rewards.  
- Meanwhile, the apple at (12, 7) is only 3 steps away — I can eat it immediately

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 4). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the trade-off between immediate reward and long-term benefit.

Currently, I am at (7, 4). The nearest apple is at (4, 6), which is 5 units away — a significant distance. The nearest dirt is at (7, 1), only 3 units away. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), cleaning dirt is essential for future apple spawning.

Key observations:
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately, but only if an apple is present and accessible.
- Apples do not spawn on land unless the river is clean — meaning cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apple availability.
- Right now, there is no visible apple nearby, and the nearest apple is 5 steps away. That means I cannot eat an apple immediately, even if I move toward it — because the spawning condition (clean river) isn't met yet.
- The dirt at (7, 1) is only 3 units away — a short path. Cleaning it would improve the environment and enable future apple spawning.

Therefore:
- I cannot eat an apple right now because apples don’t spawn until the river is clean.
- Cleaning dirt provides no immediate reward, but it enables

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 4). You see agent 1 at (8, 3), dirt at (6, 4) and dirt at (6, 5).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to determine the best course of action as Agent 3.

Current position: (7, 4)  
Visible agents: Agent 1 at (8, 3)  
Visible dirt: (6, 4) and (6, 5)  
Global scan:  
- Nearest apple: (2, 5), distance = 6  
- Nearest dirt: (6, 4), distance = 1  

First, consider the immediate options:

1. **Eat an apple?**  
   The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 steps away. That’s a long distance. There are no apples visible in the immediate vicinity (only at (2,5)), and no indication that any apples are spawning due to clean land. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), and we currently have dirt at (6,4), the apple at (2,5) is not accessible or viable *unless* the river is clean. But the river's cleanliness isn't directly visible here — it's implied to be tied to dirt removal. So, eating an apple now would require a long journey to (2,5), which

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see dirt at (6, 4) and agent 3 at (6, 4).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

Currently, I am at (7, 3). The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — quite far. There is dirt at (6, 4), which is only 2 units away, and agent 3 is currently standing there. This means the dirt is immediately adjacent and accessible.

The key trade-off is:
- **Eating an apple** gives +1.0 immediately, but there are no apples visible nearby — the nearest is 6 units away. Without cleaning the dirt, apples won’t spawn at all. So, no apple can be eaten now.
- **Cleaning dirt** at (6, 4) is necessary to enable future apple spawning. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when there's less dirt), cleaning this dirt will eventually allow apples to appear — possibly at (12, 2) or elsewhere. This is a long-term investment with no immediate reward.
- There is no nearby apple to eat, so option 1 is not viable.

Additionally, agent 3 is already at the dirt. That suggests the dirt might be a point of contention or shared resource. If
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 0). You see dirt at (6, 0).
  Thinking: I am at (8, 0) and see dirt at (6, 0). The nearest apple is at (13, 0), 5 units away — quite far. The nearest dirt is only 2 units away, at (6, 0), which means I can reach it in one move (moving left to (6, 0)).

Let’s analyze the trade-offs:

1. **Eating an apple for immediate reward**:  
   There is no apple in immediate range (within one step). The closest apple is at (13, 0), requiring 5 steps to reach. Eating it would give +1.0, but it's not accessible now. So, no immediate apple is available to eat. This option is not viable right now.

2. **Cleaning dirt to enable future apple spawning**:  
   Dirt must be cleaned to allow apples to spawn. Since apples only appear when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt), removing dirt at (6, 0) will improve the environment for future apple generation. This action is strategic — it doesn’t give immediate reward, but it enables future opportunities. Given that the nearest apple is still far away (5 units), and the dirt is only 2
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 4). You see agent 1 at (7, 3), dirt at (6, 4) and dirt at (6, 5).
  Thinking: I am at (6, 4), which currently has dirt, and I see agent 1 at (7, 3). The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 steps away — quite distant. There is no apple in immediate range. The dirt at (6, 4) and (6, 5) must be cleaned to allow apples to spawn, but eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately, while cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward but enables future apple spawning.

Let’s evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple** — There is no apple visible at my current position. The nearest apple is 5 steps away, and I don’t see any apples in the immediate vicinity. Eating an apple now would require movement to reach it, and since no apple is present, I cannot eat one. So this option is not viable.

2. **Clean dirt** — I am standing on (6, 4), which has dirt. Cleaning it would remove dirt and potentially allow apples to spawn in the future. The dirt at (6, 5) is adjacent — so cleaning (6, 4) or (6, 5) could help clear a path or enable apple spawning nearby. Since apples

--- Step 40 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 3). You see agent 3 at (6, 4).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 5).

Reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 1), which is 6 units away — far out of reach for immediate consumption. There is no nearby apple within a short distance, so eating one now would give no immediate benefit and would be inefficient.
- The nearest dirt is at (6, 5), just 1 step away (distance 2), meaning I can reach it quickly.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple generation. This is a critical system mechanic: dirt removal enables apple spawning, which directly supports the group's long-term goal.
- Since I cannot move diagonally, my movement is constrained to cardinal directions. From (6, 3), moving to (6, 4) is toward agent 3, but that’s not productive. Moving to (6, 5) is directly adjacent and only one step away — a minimal cost for a high-impact action.
- Cleaning dirt provides no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawns, which can lead to higher cumulative points for the group. This aligns with the goal of maximizing points through sustainable progress, not short-term gains.
- There
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 5}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 0). You see dirt at (6, 0).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 0), and I see dirt at (6, 0), which is just one step away. The nearest apple is at (1, 0), 6 units away — far beyond my current reach. Eating that apple would require moving left across a long stretch of land, but there's no indication that any apples are currently spawning, and the only apples visible are far away.

Crucially, the rule states: **Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (less dirt = more apples).** This means that cleaning dirt is not just a side task — it's a prerequisite for apples to appear. Since there are currently no apples visible and the nearest apple is 6 units away, it is highly likely that the land is currently dirty and thus unable to spawn apples.

Therefore, the immediate reward of eating an apple is not feasible — there are no apples within reach, and even if there were, they wouldn’t spawn without cleaning the dirt.

The dirt at (6, 0) is directly adjacent and only one step away. Cleaning it would:
- Improve the condition of the land,
- Enable the possibility of apple spawning in the future,
- Support the group’s long-term goal of maximizing apple harvest.
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 4). You see agent 1 at (6, 3) and dirt at (6, 5).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully.

Currently, I am at (6, 4). I see:
- Agent 1 at (6, 3) — directly above me, so we're in the same column.
- Dirt at (6, 5) — directly to my right, just one step away.
- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 steps away — quite far.
- The river is currently dirty, so apples are not spawning.

Key rule: Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed). Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward but enables future apple spawning. So, cleaning dirt is a long-term investment.

Right now, I have no apple in immediate reach — the nearest is 5 steps away. There's no apple at (6, 5) or nearby. The dirt at (6, 5) is adjacent and only one step away.

Option 1: Eat an apple → not possible right now. No apple is visible or reachable immediately. Even if there were one, the global scan says the nearest is 5 steps away, and I'm not in a position to reach it without moving.

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 0). You see dirt at (6, 0).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 0).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (1, 0), which is 6 units away. To reach it, I would need to move through several tiles, possibly passing through or near dirt. However, apples only spawn *when the river is clean*, meaning that dirt must be cleaned before apples can appear. Since the dirt at (6, 0) is currently present and directly adjacent to my position at (7, 0), it is a critical obstacle.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 point, but it would not solve the underlying issue: apples won't spawn unless dirt is cleaned. If I skip cleaning this dirt, future apple spawns (including the one at (1,0)) will remain blocked, and the group's long-term progress is compromised.
- Cleaning dirt has no immediate reward, but it is a necessary prerequisite for apple spawning. Since the dirt is only one step away and directly in my path to the nearest apple, it makes sense to prioritize cleaning it now.
- There is no immediate benefit to exploring further without addressing the dirt first. The global scan shows no other dirt nearby, and the apple at (1,0) is far
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 4). You see dirt at (6, 5).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 5).

Reasoning:

- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Currently, there is dirt at (6, 5), which is directly adjacent to my current position. This dirt is blocking apple spawning in that area.
- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away — quite far. Eating it now would give +1.0 point, but it's not a strategic or immediate benefit given the long distance and the fact that apples are not spawning due to dirt.
- Cleaning the dirt at (6, 5) does not give immediate reward, but it is a necessary step to enable future apple spawning. Once the dirt is cleaned, land becomes available for apples to spawn, potentially leading to more apples in the future — which increases the total points available to the group.
- Since I cannot move diagonally, moving to (6, 5) to clean it is a simple, low-cost action (only one step).
- There is no nearby apple (within 1 step) to eat immediately. The nearest apple is 5 steps away, and there's no indication that apples are currently spawning due to clean land — so no immediate eating is beneficial

--- Step 41 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 2). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: Given the current situation, let's analyze the trade-offs carefully:

1. **Should you eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   The nearest apple is at (2, 1), which is 5 units away. Since you're at (6, 2), moving to (2, 1) would require a path of at least 5 steps — a significant distance. Eating an apple gives +1.0 point, but this is a one-time reward with no benefit to future apple spawning. Given that apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and there's currently dirt at (6, 0) just 2 units away, the immediate apple is not accessible without first addressing the dirt issue.

2. **Should you clean dirt to ensure future apples spawn?**  
   Yes — and this is the more strategic move. The dirt at (6, 0) is only 2 units away, which means it's very accessible. Cleaning it will make the river cleaner, which increases the likelihood of apples spawning in the future (especially at (2, 1) or nearby locations). Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for long-term apple availability. Even
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 0). You see dirt at (6, 0).
  Thinking: I am at (6, 0), directly on a dirt patch. The nearest apple is at (1, 0), which is 5 units away — a significant distance. Currently, there is no apple visible nearby, and the only dirt is at my current position.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple at (6, 0). The only apple in the global scan is at (1, 0), which is far away and not accessible without first cleaning the dirt. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), and we currently have dirt at (6, 0), there is no apple available to eat. Therefore, **eating an apple is not possible now** — this option is invalid.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   Yes. Dirt removal is a prerequisite for apple spawning. Since apples only appear when the river is clean (less dirt), cleaning the dirt at (6, 0) will eventually allow apples to spawn — possibly at (1, 0) or elsewhere. This is a necessary step to enable future rewards. Even though cleaning gives no immediate points, it is a
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 5). You see dirt at (6, 5) and dirt at (7, 6).
  Thinking: I am at (6, 5), and the current observation shows dirt at both (6, 5) and (7, 6). The global scan indicates that the nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 4 steps away — a reasonable distance but not immediate. The nearest dirt is at (6, 5), which is where I currently am, meaning I'm standing on dirt and can clean it.

Now, let’s analyze the trade-off:

1. **Should I eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple at my current location. The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 4 steps away. Eating it would require movement and time. Since I have no immediate apple available, and the apple is far away, the immediate reward is not accessible. So, eating an apple now is not feasible.

2. **Should I clean dirt to ensure future apples spawn?**  
   This is critical. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning, when dirt is removed. Currently, there is dirt at (6, 5) and (7, 6). Cleaning dirt is not rewarding in itself, but it enables future apple spawning. Since apples are

--- Step 42 ---
Moving from (6, 1) towards (5, 1).
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 1). You see agent 2 at (6, 0).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

You are currently at (6, 1), and Agent 2 is at (6, 0) — directly below you. This suggests a potential for interaction or competition, but since the rules don't specify penalties for proximity or cooperation, and we're focused on maximizing points (apples), we should prioritize what yields the most *value*.

### Key Facts:
- **Nearest Apple**: at (2, 1), distance = 4.  
  → You can reach it in 4 moves (up/down/left/right only).  
- **Nearest Dirt**: at (7, 6), distance = 6.  
  → Requires 6 moves to reach.  
- Apples only spawn *when the river is clean* (i.e., when dirt is cleaned).  
- Cleaning dirt gives **no immediate reward**, but enables future apple spawning.  
- Eating an apple gives **+1.0 point immediately**.

### Trade-off Analysis:

**Option 1: Eat an apple now?**  
- The apple at (2,1) is within reach (4 moves).  
- You can reach it via path: (6,1) → (5,1) → (4
  Decision: {'action': 'move_to', 'args': {'coord_x': 5, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 0). You see agent 1 at (6, 1).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision.

Current position: (6, 0)  
Agent 1 is at (6, 1) — directly above me, so we're in close proximity.  
Nearest apple is at (1, 0), which is 5 units away — that’s a significant distance.  
Nearest dirt is at (7, 6), which is 7 units away — quite far.  

The key trade-off is between:
- Immediate reward: eating an apple (+1.0 point)
- Long-term benefit: cleaning dirt to enable future apple spawning

But here’s the critical point: **apples only spawn when the river is clean** — meaning cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apple generation. However, there are **no apples currently visible** — the nearest apple is far away, at (1,0), and it's not clear whether that apple is already available or will spawn depending on dirt status.

- Eat apple now: +1.0 immediate reward, but no long-term benefit
  Decision: {'action': 'move_to', 'args': {'coord_x': 11, 'coord_y': 7}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (11, 2). You see an apple at (10, 2).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (10, 2).

Reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only one step away — a direct, low-effort action that gives a clear +1.0 reward.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 3), which is 5 steps away. Cleaning it would require significant movement and time, with no immediate benefit. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is reduced), this is a long-term strategy.
- There is no indication that the dirt will spawn more apples in the near future, nor is there any urgency in cleaning it. The immediate goal is to maximize points — and the apple is within reach.
- The rule states that cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, so investing effort in that now would be a missed opportunity for a direct point gain.
- There is no other nearby apple or dirt to consider — the apple at (10, 2) is the only one visible and is at minimal distance.

Therefore, the optimal action is to eat the apple immediately. This maximizes immediate reward while leaving the long-term dirt-cleaning task for when it becomes more relevant or necessary (e.g., if future apples are not spawning). 

This decision aligns
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 10, 'coord_y': 2}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 6). You see dirt at (8, 6) and agent 1 at (10, 7).
  Thinking: I am at (8, 6), which is directly on a dirt patch — the nearest dirt is at distance 0. This means the river is currently dirty, and apples do not spawn until the river is clean. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, I cannot eat an apple right now, as there are no apples available due to the dirt.

The nearest apple is at (3, 6), which is 5 units away — a significant distance. To reach it, I would need to clean the dirt first, which means I must move to a clean section of the river. However, cleaning dirt does not give immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning — a long-term benefit for the group.

Currently, there is no apple in my immediate vicinity, and I cannot eat one without first cleaning the dirt. Therefore, the immediate reward (eating an apple) is not possible.

Option 2 — cleaning the dirt — is necessary to enable apple spawning. Since apples are the only source of points, and they only appear when the river is clean, cleaning the dirt is a prerequisite for future gains.

There is no nearby dirt to clean except at (8, 6), which I am already on. So, I must clean it.

--- Step 41 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (11, 7). You see an apple at (13, 6), an apple at (13, 7) and an apple at (13, 8).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 3) to improve the river's cleanliness and enable future apple spawning.

Here’s the reasoning:

- The immediate apples at (13, 6), (13, 7), and (13, 8) are already visible and within reach. However, the global scan shows that the nearest dirt is at (7, 3), which is 8 units away. This means that the river is currently dirty, and apples only spawn when the river is clean. Therefore, apples are not guaranteed to appear in the future unless dirt is cleaned.

- Eating an apple now gives +1.0 reward, which is valuable, but it’s a one-time gain. If I eat one now, I’m sacrificing the opportunity to clean dirt and potentially enable more apples to spawn in the future—especially since the current apples may be temporary or limited.

- The trade-off is between immediate reward and long-term sustainability. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, cleaning the dirt at (7, 3) is a prerequisite for future apple generation. Without cleaning, the system remains stagnant, and new apples won’t appear.

- Even though the nearest apple is at (13, 7) — only
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 3}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (10, 2). You see an apple at (10, 2).
  Thinking: I am at (10, 2), and there is an apple directly at my position — distance 0. This means I can immediately eat it and gain +1.0 point. 

Looking at the global scan: the nearest dirt is at (7, 3), which is 4 units away. Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable future apple spawning, but it provides no immediate reward. The trade-off is between immediate gratification (eating the apple) and long-term benefit (cleaning dirt to support future apple growth).

However, there is no indication that dirt cleaning is currently needed or that apples are not spawning — in fact, the apple is already present. The presence of an apple at (10, 2) implies the river is already clean enough for spawning at that location. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and we already have a clean spot with an apple, there's no immediate need to clean dirt *now*.

Moreover, cleaning dirt would require movement (to (7,3) or beyond), which would take time and opportunity cost — we could lose the immediate +1.0 point. Given that we are already in a position with an apple, and no other apples or dirt are closer, there is no urgent
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 10, 'coord_y': 2}} -> Env Action: 'eat'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 6). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 3) — even though it doesn't give immediate reward.

Here's why:

- The nearest apple is at (3, 6), which is 5 units away. That's a significant distance, and currently, apples only spawn when the river is clean. Since there's no visible apple spawning in the current state, the apples are likely *not* available yet.
- The dirt at (7, 3) is only 4 units away — closer than the apple. Cleaning it would improve the river's cleanliness, which in turn increases the chance of apples spawning in the future.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 point, but only if one is available. Since no apple is visible nearby and the apple spawn condition depends on clean water, we risk missing future opportunities by not improving the environment.
- The goal is to maximize points over time. Immediate apple consumption gives short-term gain, but cleaning dirt enables more apples to spawn later — which can lead to sustained or even exponential point gains.

Additionally, since you're at (8,6), moving to (7,3) is feasible via a path: (8,6) → (7,6) → (7,5)

--- Step 42 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (10, 7). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: The current observation shows that I am at (10, 7), and the nearest apple is at (13, 7) — just 3 steps away. That’s a very short distance, and eating an apple would give me an immediate +1.0 reward. However, the nearest dirt is at (7, 3), which is 7 steps away — quite far. 

Let’s analyze the trade-off:

1. **Eating an apple now**:
   - Immediate reward: +1.0 point.
   - This gives me a quick boost in score.
   - The apple is within reach — no risk of missing it.
   - However, if I eat the apple, I don’t clean dirt, which means future apple spawning may be blocked. Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is reduced). So, by not cleaning dirt, I’m potentially limiting future opportunities for apples — especially since the global scan shows that dirt is a prerequisite for apple spawning.

2. **Cleaning the dirt at (7, 3)**:
   - No immediate reward.
   - Requires moving 7 steps (to (7, 3)), which takes time and effort.
- The trade-off between immediate reward
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 1, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 0). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 1 at (1, 1).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Here’s the reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only 1 step away — that’s a direct, actionable opportunity for a +1.0 point reward with no risk.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 2), which is 7 steps away. Cleaning it would require significant movement and time, and there’s no immediate benefit from it — no apples are currently spawning, and no indication that future apple spawns depend on cleaning dirt in the short term.
- There’s no threat or obstruction from Agent 1 at (1, 1), who is just one step above me. I can safely move to (1, 0) to eat the apple without endangering myself or being blocked.
- The rule states that apples only spawn when the river is clean — but this is a *future* condition. Since we’re not currently at a dirt site, and there’s no indication that cleaning dirt will yield immediate or near-term benefits, it’s not a priority.
- In a cleanup game, the goal is to maximize points. Eating an apple gives immediate points. Delaying that for a long-term, uncertain benefit (future apple spawning) is a suboptimal trade-off when a
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 1, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see dirt at (7, 2).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 2), and I see dirt at that exact location. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — on the same row, so I can move right along the path. However, apples only spawn when the river is clean, meaning that dirt must be cleaned before apples can appear. Right now, there is dirt at (7, 2), and since apples don’t spawn on dirty land, I cannot eat an apple from this location.

Option 1: Eat an apple for immediate reward — **Not possible right now**. There is no apple visible at (7, 2), and apples only spawn on clean land. Since the dirt is present, the land is not clean, so no apple exists here. Attempting to eat an apple would be futile and incorrect.

Option 2: Clean the dirt at (7, 2) — **This is necessary**. Cleaning this dirt will eventually allow apples to spawn on this land, especially since the nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is on the same row. If we keep the dirt unclean, no apples will spawn there. Cleaning the dirt at (7, 2) is a foundational step

--- Step 40 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (1, 1). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 2 at (2, 0).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Here's the reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only 1 step away — this is a direct, positive action that gives me +1.0 point with no risk or cost.
- The nearest dirt is at (6, 5), which is 9 steps away. Cleaning it would require significant movement and time, and there's no immediate benefit or indication that apples will spawn until the river is clean. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and we don’t currently have any apples spawning due to dirt, cleaning dirt is a long-term, speculative action with no current payoff.
- Agent 2 is at (2, 0), which is adjacent to the apple. If agent 2 is also trying to eat the apple, there could be a conflict. However, since the apple is at (1, 0) and I'm at (1, 1), I can reach it first by moving down to (1, 0) and eating it before agent 2 does. This gives me a competitive advantage and ensures I get the immediate reward.
- There is no evidence that cleaning dirt will yield more apples in a way that outweighs the immediate gain from eating the
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 1, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 0). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 1 at (1, 1).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Here's the reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only 1 step away — this is a direct, positive action that gives +1.0 point with no risk or cost.
- The nearest dirt is at (6, 5), which is 9 steps away — cleaning it would require significant movement and time, and there's no immediate benefit or visibility of future apple spawns in the near term.
- There's no indication that the river's cleanliness is currently affecting apple spawning beyond the fact that apples are already present. Since an apple is already visible and accessible, the immediate reward is both safe and valuable.
- Agent 1 is at (1, 1), which is adjacent to the apple at (1, 0) — this suggests potential conflict or competition. Eating the apple now prevents agent 1 from getting it, giving me a competitive advantage. If I wait, agent 1 might eat it before I do.
- The rule says apples only spawn when the river is clean — but that doesn't mean they *don’t* exist when the river is dirty. In fact, apples may already exist even when dirt is present. So, cleaning dirt is a long-term strategy, not
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 1, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to analyze the trade-off carefully based on the current situation and long-term goals.

Currently, I am at (7, 2). The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — a reasonable distance, but not immediate. The nearest dirt is at (7, 5), which is only 3 units away directly above me. This means I can reach the dirt quickly and clean it without significant movement cost.

Key facts:
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately, which is a direct reward.
- Cleaning dirt does not give immediate reward, but it enables apples to spawn in the future — which benefits the group and increases long-term apple availability.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed). So, if I don’t clean the dirt at (7,5), no apples will spawn nearby, even if I go far to eat one.

Now, evaluating the options:

1. **Eat an apple immediately** – The apple at (12,2) is 5 steps away. I can walk there, but I would have to move through potentially dirty areas. More importantly, if I don’t clean the dirt, future apple spawning is blocked

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (1, 1). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 2 at (2, 0).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only 1 step away — this gives me a direct +1.0 reward with no risk or cost.
- The nearest dirt is at (8, 2), which is 8 steps away — this is far beyond any immediate benefit. Cleaning it would require a long journey with no immediate payoff, and since apples only spawn when the river is clean, the benefit is future and uncertain.
- There is no immediate threat or interference from Agent 2 at (2, 0) — they are not blocking movement or attacking, and we are not told that agents compete for resources. In fact, the goal is to maximize points, and eating an apple directly contributes to that.
- The trade-off between immediate reward and future benefit is heavily weighted toward immediate action: eating the apple gives tangible, instant value, while cleaning dirt is a long-term, uncertain investment with no current return.

  Obs: You are at (6, 2). You see dirt at (6, 1) and agent 3 at (6, 3).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 1).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away. To reach it, I'd need to move through several tiles, and currently, there's no apple spawning because the river is not clean. Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned.
- The dirt at (6, 1) is just one tile away (distance 1), making it the most accessible dirt patch.
- Eating an apple immediately gives +1.0, but there are no apples currently visible or spawnable — the global scan shows the nearest apple is far away and requires clean conditions.
- Cleaning dirt has no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning, which benefits the entire group. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, cleaning this dirt is a necessary prerequisite to accessing the apple at (12, 2) or any others.
- There’s no immediate benefit to eating an apple now — no apple is available at the current location or nearby. The agent at (6, 3) is not a threat or a target; it's just a presence.
- Moving toward the dirt at (6,
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 3). You see agent 2 at (6, 2).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision for maximizing points and supporting the group's long-term success.

I am currently at (6, 3), and I see Agent 2 at (6, 2) — directly below me. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 7 units away. That’s quite far. The nearest dirt is at (6, 1), which is only 2 units away — directly below me. That means I can reach the dirt quickly and clean it without much movement.

Now, let’s evaluate the trade-offs:

1. **Eating an apple for immediate reward**:  
   The nearest apple is far away (7 units), and I don’t currently have any apples in sight. There’s no apple at (6, 3) or nearby. So, eating an apple would require a long journey, and there’s no immediate apple available. Therefore, this option doesn’t provide value right now.

2. **Cleaning dirt to enable future apple spawning**:  
   Dirt cleaning is not immediately rewarding, but it's essential — apples only spawn when the river is clean. By cleaning the dirt at (6, 1), I’m enabling the possibility of apples appearing in

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 0). You see dirt at (6, 1).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 1).

Here’s my reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible nearby. The nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 7 units away — far out of reach without first clearing obstacles.
- The only dirt in the immediate vicinity is at (6, 1), just one step away. This dirt is blocking apple spawning, and apples only appear when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed).
- Eating an apple now is not possible because there are no apples in the current field of view or within reach. Even if there were, the apple at (13, 0) is too far to reach without clearing dirt first.
- Cleaning dirt provides no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning — which is essential for long-term point accumulation and group success.
- Since I cannot move diagonally, my movement is constrained to cardinal directions. From (6, 0), I can move to (6, 1) to clean it — a simple, efficient action.
- The trade-off between immediate reward and long-term benefit is clear: no apples are available now, so there’s no immediate gain from eating. The only meaningful action is to remove dirt to

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 2). You see dirt at (6, 1) and agent 3 at (6, 3).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to make the best decision for maximizing points and contributing to the group's success.

Current position: (6, 2)  
Visible dirt: (6, 1) — only 1 step away  
Agent 3 is at (6, 3) — directly to the right  
Nearest apple: (12, 2), 6 steps away  
Dirt at (6,1) is the nearest dirt, and cleaning it would allow apples to spawn in the future.

Now, evaluating the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward**  
   The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 steps away. That would require moving right to (6,3), then up/down, then right again — a long path. There are no apples visible nearby (like at (6,2) or (6,3)), and the only apple in range is far away. Eating it now would give +1.0, but it's not immediately accessible. Also, the river is currently dirty (due to dirt at (6,1)), so no apples can spawn — meaning no apples are available *now*, regardless of eating.

2. **Clean the dirt at
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 3). You see agent 2 at (6, 2).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision.

Current position: (6, 3)  
Agent 2 is at (6, 2) — directly below me, so we're in the same column.  
Nearest Apple: (12, 2) — 7 units away (horizontal distance).  
Nearest Dirt: (6, 1) — only 1 unit down from me (distance = 1).  

Important rule: Apples only spawn when the river is clean. Cleaning dirt has no immediate reward but enables future apple spawning. So, cleaning dirt is a long-term investment.

Let’s assess the options:

1. **Eat an apple immediately**  
   - The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 7 units away.  
   - To reach it, I’d need to move right and then down or up — but there’s no apple spawning yet, so I can’t eat one unless it’s already available.  
   - The key point: apples only spawn when dirt is cleaned. Since the nearest dirt is at (6, 1), and it’s only 1 step away, I can clean it now.  
   - If I don’t clean it,

--- Step 41 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 0). You see dirt at (6, 1).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 1).

Reasoning:

- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Right now, there is dirt at (6, 1), which is directly adjacent to my current position. This dirt is blocking apple spawning in that area.
- The nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 7 units away — far from immediate reach. Eating it would give +1.0 point, but it's not urgent or guaranteed, especially since apples depend on clean conditions.
- Cleaning dirt is not immediately rewarding, but it is a prerequisite for future apple spawning. If I leave the dirt uncleaned, no apples will spawn in that region — and the group’s ability to earn points is limited.
- Since I’m at (6, 0) and the dirt is at (6, 1), I can move down to (6, 1) and clean it in one step (no diagonal movement required).
- After cleaning, the land at (6, 1) becomes clean, which increases the chance of apples spawning nearby. Given that the nearest apple is at (13, 0), a clean path toward that area (e.g., along the x-axis)

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 2). You see dirt at (6, 1) and agent 3 at (6, 3).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 1).

Reasoning:

- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Right now, there is dirt at (6, 1), which is directly adjacent to my current position (6, 2). This dirt is blocking apple spawning in that area.
- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — quite far. Eating it would give +1.0 immediately, but it requires reaching it without first cleaning the dirt that prevents apple spawning nearby.
- Cleaning dirt does not give immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning. Since apples are the primary source of points, and they are currently blocked due to dirt, cleaning is a necessary prerequisite for long-term gains.
- There is no immediate apple nearby (the nearest is at distance 6), and the dirt at (6, 1) is only 1 unit away — a very low-cost action to perform.
Therefore,
  Decision: {'action': 'move_to', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 4}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 0). You see dirt at (6, 0).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 0).

Here's my reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible nearby — the nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 5 units away. At (8, 0), I am already quite close to the dirt at (6, 0), which is only 2 units away. 
- Eating an apple now would give me +1.0 point, but there are no apples in immediate range. The apple at (13, 0) is far away and will only spawn if the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned first.
- The rule states that apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. This means that cleaning dirt is not just a preparatory step — it’s a prerequisite for apple spawning. Without cleaning, no apples will appear, regardless of how far I walk.
- Since I am at (8, 0) and can move one step left to (7, 0) and then to (6, 0), cleaning the dirt at (6, 0) is a simple, low-cost action with high strategic value.
- By cleaning this dirt, I enable the possibility of apples spawning later — potentially at (13

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 4). You see agent 1 at (7, 3), dirt at (6, 4) and dirt at (6, 5).
  Thinking: I am at (6, 4), which currently has dirt, and I see agent 1 at (7, 3). The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 steps away. There is no apple currently visible or reachable in immediate vicinity — the only visible dirt is at (6, 4) and (6, 5), both of which are on my current position and adjacent to me.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There is no apple at (6, 4) or (6, 5). The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is far away and requires movement. Eating an apple would require being in a position where one is available. Since no apple is currently visible or reachable in one step, **I cannot eat an apple immediately**. Therefore, this option is not viable right now.

2. **Clean dirt to ensure future apples spawn?**  
   → Dirt at (6, 4) and (6, 5) is present. Cleaning dirt is essential because apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed). Removing dirt from (6, 4

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 3). You see agent 3 at (6, 4).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am at (6, 3), and I see Agent 3 at (6, 4) — they are directly above me, one step away. The nearest apple is at (2, 1), which is 6 steps away — quite far. The nearest dirt is at (6, 5), which is just one step away from me (distance 2). 

Now, let's assess the trade-offs:

1. **Eating an apple for immediate reward**:  
   The nearest apple is at (2, 1), which requires moving left and up — a long path. There’s no apple in close range (within 1 or 2 steps). So, eating an apple immediately would require significant movement and would not yield a reward unless I can reach it quickly. Given the distance, this is not efficient.

2. **Cleaning dirt to enable future apple spawning**:  
   The dirt is only 2 steps away — at (6, 5). Cleaning it would directly improve the river's cleanliness, increasing the chance of apples spawning in the future. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, this action is foundational. It supports the group’s long-term
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 5}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 0). You see dirt at (6, 0).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 0).

Reasoning:

- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Currently, there is dirt at (6, 0), which blocks apple spawning. Even though the nearest apple is at (1, 0) — 6 units away — it is not currently accessible because the land is contaminated.
- Eating an apple immediately (option 1) would give a +1.0 reward, but if the river remains dirty, no more apples will spawn in the future. This limits long-term potential.
- Cleaning dirt (option 2) has no immediate reward, but it is essential for enabling future apple spawning. Since apples are the only source of points and they require clean land to appear, this action is foundational to maximizing total points over time.
- There is no immediate nearby apple or viable exploration point that doesn't depend on clean land. Moving toward (6, 0) to clean it is the only logical step to enable future apple growth.

Therefore, despite the lack of immediate reward, cleaning the dirt at (6, 0) is the correct strategic move. It enables the possibility of apples spawning in the future, which is necessary to achieve maximum points. The trade-off is favorable
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 4). You see agent 1 at (6, 3) and dirt at (6, 5).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the current situation and make a strategic decision based on the game rules and objectives.

Currently, I am at (6, 4). I see:
- Agent 1 at (6, 3) — directly to my left, adjacent.
- Dirt at (6, 5) — directly to my right, one step away.

Global scan shows:
- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 steps away.
- The nearest dirt is at (6, 5), just one step from me.

Key points:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned). So, no apples can spawn unless dirt is removed.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning — which benefits the group.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediate reward, but only if an apple is present and accessible.

Now, the critical question: **Is there an apple currently available for me to eat?**

From the global scan, the nearest apple is at (2, 5) — which is 5 steps away. There's no indication of any apple being present at my current location or nearby (e.g., (6, 4

--- Step 41 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 4). You see dirt at (6, 5) and agent 3 at (6, 5).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 5).

Here’s the reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible in immediate range (the nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away), and I am at (6, 4). Eating an apple is not immediately possible due to distance and lack of spawn conditions.
- The dirt at (6, 5) is directly adjacent and is the nearest dirt patch — this means it's the most accessible point to clean.
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. By cleaning this dirt, I enable future apple spawning, which benefits the entire group — including myself, as apples are the only source of points.
- There is no immediate reward from eating an apple in this situation because I cannot reach one without significant movement and no current apple is visible or accessible.
- Moving to (6, 5) to clean it is a minimal action (one step), and it directly advances the group's long-term goal of enabling apple spawning.
- Since the dirt is adjacent and the river's cleanliness directly affects apple availability, cleaning it is a necessary prerequisite for future apple access.

Therefore, the optimal action is to clean the dirt at (6, 5) — it
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 5}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 0). You see dirt at (6, 0).
  Thinking: I am at (6, 0), and I see dirt at that exact location. The nearest apple is at (1, 0), which is 5 units away — a significant distance. Right now, there is no apple visible at my current position, and the only dirt is right where I am standing.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There is no apple at (6, 0). The nearest apple is 5 steps away. Eating an apple would require moving to (1, 0), which is not currently reachable without first cleaning dirt or navigating through the environment. Since no apple is available immediately, this option is not viable.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
- There’s no immediate alternative nearby that provides a better trade-off. The nearest dirt is directly
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 3}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 1). You see agent 1 at (8, 0) and dirt at (6, 1).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to determine the best course of action.

I am currently at (7, 1). The nearest dirt is at (6, 1), which is only one step away — directly to the west. Cleaning this dirt would improve the river's cleanliness and enable apples to spawn in the future. Since apples only appear when the river is clean, this is a prerequisite for apple spawning. 

Right now, there are no apples visible in my immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 steps away — a significant distance. Even if I could eat an apple, there are no apples available at my current position. Therefore, **eating an apple is not possible immediately**.

The only actionable item nearby is the dirt at (6, 1). Cleaning it will improve the conditions for apple spawning in the long term, which benefits the group. Since I cannot move diagonally, I can only move in cardinal directions. Moving west to (6, 1) is straightforward and safe.

There is no immediate reward for cleaning dirt — but without it, apples will not spawn, and the group will be unable to gain the +1.0 points from apples. Given that the nearest apple is

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 0). You see dirt at (6, 0), dirt at (6, 1) and agent 3 at (6, 1).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to determine the best course of action.

Current position: (7, 0)  
Observed dirt: (6, 0) and (6, 1)  
Agent 3 is at (6, 1)  
Nearest apple: (13, 0), distance 6  
Nearest dirt: (6, 0), distance 1  

Key observations:
- There are no apples currently visible or reachable in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is 6 units away, which is far and requires a long path.
- Dirt is present at (6, 0) and (6, 1), with (6, 0) being only 1 step away — very close.
- Cleaning dirt is essential because apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed). This means cleaning dirt enables future apple spawning, which benefits the group.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately, but there are no apples in range to eat. The nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is far away and not currently accessible.
- There is no immediate reward from eating — no apple is within reach.

Therefore:
- Option 1 (eat
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 5). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: The current observation shows that I am at (8, 5), with no visible nearby interest. The global scan reveals that:

- The nearest apple is at (13, 6), which is 6 steps away — far enough that immediate consumption would require significant movement.
- The nearest dirt is at (8, 3), just 2 steps away — very close and accessible.

Now, evaluating the trade-offs:

1. **Eating an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There are no apples visible or nearby. The nearest apple is 6 steps away, and since apples only spawn *when the river is clean*, we cannot assume any apple exists at (13,6) unless the dirt has been cleaned. Therefore, eating an apple now is not feasible — it would require first cleaning dirt to enable apple spawning, and even then, we'd have to travel to it. So, no immediate reward is possible.

2. **Cleaning dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   This is critical. Dirt must be cleaned to allow apples to spawn. The dirt at (8,3) is only 2 steps away — very accessible. Cleaning it would directly contribute to enabling apple spawning, potentially leading to apples appearing in the future (e

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 1). You see dirt at (6, 0), agent 1 at (7, 0) and dirt at (6, 1).
  Thinking: I am at (6, 1), and the current observation shows that there is dirt at (6, 1) — which is directly where I am. This means the river is currently dirty at my position, and apples do not spawn when the river is dirty. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 7 units away — a significant distance. There is no apple in immediate proximity, and the only dirt nearby is at (6, 1), which I am currently standing on.

Let’s evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There is no apple visible at (6, 1). The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is far away. Eating an apple would require moving to that location first — and it's not currently accessible. So, **no immediate apple is available to eat**. This option is not viable.

2. **Clean dirt to ensure future apples spawn?**  
   → Yes. The dirt at (6, 1) is directly in front of me (or at my position), and cleaning it would make the river clean at that point. Once the river is clean, apples can spawn — and the global scan confirms

--- Step 42 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 0). You see dirt at (6, 0) and agent 3 at (6, 1).
  Thinking: I am at (6, 0), directly on a dirt patch with no apples visible nearby. The nearest apple is at (13, 0), 7 units away — far enough that immediate consumption would require significant movement. There is no apple currently spawnable at my position because dirt is present, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is removed).

Key points:
- Eating an apple now is impossible — no apple is visible at (6, 0).
- The dirt at (6, 0) is the nearest dirt, meaning it's the most accessible for cleaning.
- Cleaning dirt does not give immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning — which benefits the group and increases long-term points.
- The global scan shows that apples are far away (at (13, 0)), suggesting that cleaning dirt now is essential to eventually make apples spawn in reachable areas.

Therefore, the trade-off is:
- Immediate reward: None available (no apple to eat).
- Long-term benefit: Cleaning this dirt will eventually allow apples to spawn in areas that are reachable (like the path toward (13, 0)), enabling future apple collection.

Since no apple is available and cleaning dirt is necessary to enable future apple spawning
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 4). You see dirt at (8, 3).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (8, 3).

Here's the reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible in immediate range. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 steps away — quite far.
- The dirt at (8, 3) is only 1 step away from my current position (8, 4), meaning it's immediately accessible.
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple generation.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 point, but there are no apples available to eat at this moment. The apple at (12, 2) is too far away and not currently spawnable due to dirt blocking the path or the environment being dirty.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning — which benefits the group and increases long-term potential for scoring.
- Since I cannot move diagonally, moving to (8, 3) is straightforward and efficient.

  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (4, 6). You see an apple at (2, 5) and an apple at (4, 6).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (4, 6) for immediate reward.

Reasoning:

- The apple at (4, 6) is directly adjacent to my current position — distance 0 — meaning I can eat it instantly with no movement cost.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately, which is a clear, tangible reward with no risk.
- The nearest dirt is at (6, 2), which is 6 units away — a significant distance. Cleaning it would require multiple steps and provides no immediate benefit. Moreover, apple spawning only occurs when the river is clean, but since apples are already present (especially at (4,6)), the system already has a baseline of spawnable apples.
- There is no indication that cleaning dirt is urgent or that future apples depend on immediate action. The current apple at (4,6) is already available and accessible.
- Since I cannot move diagonally, efficiency matters — and eating the apple at (4,6) requires no movement, minimizing effort.
- The group benefit of cleaning dirt is speculative and long-term. Without evidence that future apple spawns are dependent on cleaning dirt now, or that the dirt at (6,2) is critical, it's irrational to sacrifice immediate reward for
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 4, 'coord_y': 6}} -> Env Action: 'eat'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (12, 5). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 1), even though it’s far away and there’s no immediate reward.

Here’s why:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 7), just 2 steps away. That seems tempting — eating it would give +1.0 immediately. However, apples only spawn *when the river is clean*, which means dirt must be removed. Right now, there is dirt at (7, 1), which is 9 units away. This dirt is likely affecting the river’s cleanliness, preventing apples from spawning — even if one is nearby.

- Eating an apple now would be a short-term gain, but if the dirt remains, apples may not spawn in the future. Since the goal is to *maximize points over time* (not just immediate gain), and apples are the only source of points, we must ensure the system allows for future apple spawning.

- Cleaning dirt is not rewarding immediately, but it is a necessary precondition for future apple generation. Without cleaning, the river remains dirty, and apples won’t appear — even if they seem close.

- There’s no immediate interest nearby, and the apple at (12, 7) is only 2 steps away. However, if that apple

--- Step 42 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see dirt at (6, 2).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am currently at (7, 3). The observation shows dirt at (6, 2), which is adjacent and reachable. The global scan indicates:
- The nearest apple is at (3, 1), which is 6 units away — quite far.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 1), which is only 2 units away from my current position (7,3) — directly below.

This means that dirt is actually quite close — just one step down to (7,1). Cleaning this dirt would contribute to making the river cleaner, which increases the chance of apples spawning in the future. Apples only spawn when the river is clean, so cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple generation.

Right now, there is no apple in immediate range. The nearest apple is 6 steps away, and there's no indication that apples are currently spawning — likely because the river is still dirty. Therefore, eating an apple now would give me +1.0 point, but it would be a wasted action since no apples are currently available.

Moreover, the dirt at (6,2) is not directly threatening — it's not near the nearest dirt point. The dirt

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (4, 6). You see an apple at (2, 5).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (2, 5).

Here's the reasoning:

- The apple at (2, 5) is within reach — it's only 3 steps away (a Manhattan distance of |4–2| + |6–5| = 2 + 1 = 3). This is a short, feasible path and provides immediate +1.0 reward, which directly contributes to my score.
- The nearest dirt is at (6, 2), which is 6 steps away (|6–4| + |2–6| = 2 + 4 = 6). Cleaning this dirt would require a significant effort with no immediate benefit. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, this action is future-oriented and depends on long-term conditions we cannot predict or control.
- There is no indication that apples will spawn elsewhere in the near term, and the current apple is both visible and accessible.
- The goal is to *maximize points*, and eating an apple gives a direct, immediate point. Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward and only enables future apple spawning, which is speculative and not guaranteed.
- Given that I am at (4,6), I can move directly to (2,5) in a
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 2, 'coord_y': 5}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (11, 5). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to determine the best course of action.

Currently, I am at (11, 5). The nearest apple is at (12, 7), which is only 3 steps away — a very short distance. Eating that apple would give me an immediate +1.0 point, which is a clear, tangible reward.

However, the nearest dirt is at (7, 1), which is 8 steps away. Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apples to spawn in the future — meaning it's a long-term investment with no immediate benefit. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), cleaning dirt is essential for future apple availability. But currently, there are no apples spawning, so cleaning dirt now may not yield immediate results.

But here’s the key trade-off:  
- If I eat the apple at (12, 7), I get a point immediately.  
- If I instead go to clean dirt at (7, 1), I gain no immediate reward, but I am investing in a system that will eventually allow more apples to spawn — which benefits the group long-term.

--- Step 43 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see dirt at (7, 1) and dirt at (6, 2).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am currently at (7, 2). I observe dirt at (7, 1) and (6, 2). The nearest apple is at (3, 1), which is 5 steps away. The nearest dirt is at (7, 1), just 1 step away — very close.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   - Apples give +1.0 each, which is a direct point gain.  
   - However, apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed).  
   - Right now, there is dirt present, and no apple is currently visible in the immediate vicinity.  
   - The nearest apple is 5 steps away — far from current position.  
   - Since apples only spawn *when the river is clean*, and we currently have dirt, **apples are not spawning**.  
   - Therefore, **there is no apple at (3,1) right now** — it's just a future possibility.  
   → **Cannot eat an apple immediately.**

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Moving from (3, 6) towards (2, 5).
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (3, 6). You see an apple at (2, 5).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (2, 5).

Reasoning:

- The apple is within reach (distance 2), and eating it gives an immediate +1.0 point — a clear, tangible reward with no risk.
- The nearest dirt is at (6, 2), which is 7 units away. Cleaning it would require a significant movement cost and provides no immediate benefit. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is reduced), cleaning dirt is a long-term strategy that enables future apple spawning. However, this strategy is not currently viable because there's no immediate apple available, and the dirt is far away.
- There is no immediate benefit to cleaning dirt now — it doesn't help with current apple availability, and the group may not need apples until later.
- Given that I am at (3, 6) and the apple at (2, 5) is only one step left (moving up to (3, 5), then left to (2, 5)), the path is short and safe. No diagonal movement is needed, so navigation is straightforward.
Currently, the river is not clean (since dirt is at (7,6), far away), so apples are not spawning. Therefore, **apples are not available for immediate consumption** — even if I were at (1,0), I wouldn’t be able to eat one
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 6}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 5). You see dirt at (7, 6).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 6).

Reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 4 units away. To reach it, I would need to move through multiple steps, and since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), I cannot guarantee that apple will be available unless the environment is cleaned.
- The dirt at (7, 6) is only 2 units away — very close — and cleaning it directly supports the spawning of apples in the future. This is a necessary prerequisite for long-term apple availability.
- Eating an apple now (if one were available) gives a +1.0 immediate reward, but in this scenario, there is no visible apple at my current location. The nearest apple is far away and may not spawn until the river is clean.
- Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, cleaning dirt is not just beneficial — it's a prerequisite for apple spawning. Without cleaning, future apple access is blocked.
- The immediate reward of eating an apple is irrelevant here because no apple is accessible at (6,5) or nearby. The only available action that enables future rewards is cleaning dirt.

Therefore, the optimal strategy is to

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (5, 1). You see agent 2 at (7, 0).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am at (5, 1). The nearest apple is at (2, 1), which is just 3 steps away — a very short distance. Eating that apple would give me an immediate +1.0 reward. That’s a clear, achievable, and rewarding option.

However, the global scan shows that the nearest dirt is at (7, 6), which is 7 steps away. Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning in the future, but it provides no immediate reward. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), cleaning dirt is a long-term investment with delayed payoff.

Right now, there’s an apple within reach — and no immediate need to clean dirt, because the system already has an apple available. The apple at (2, 1) is directly accessible, and there’s no indication that the river is currently dirty or that apple spawning is blocked.

Additionally, I don’t have any information suggesting that cleaning dirt is urgent or that it will unlock more apples soon. The trade-off is between immediate gain (+1.0) and a future benefit that is both distant and uncertain.

Given that:
- I can eat
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 2, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 0). You see agent 1 at (5, 1).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the trade-off between immediate reward and long-term benefit.

Currently, I am at (7, 0), and the nearest apple is at (1, 0) — that’s a distance of 6 steps. Since I can't move diagonally, I’d need to move left along the x-axis to reach it. However, the nearest dirt is at (7, 6), which is directly above me — only 6 steps away in the y-direction. 

The key point is: apples only spawn when the river is clean. This means that dirt must be cleaned before apples can appear. Right now, there are no apples visible, and the only apples in the global scan are at (1, 0), which likely won’t spawn unless the river is clean.

But here’s the critical insight: the dirt at (7, 6) is very close to me — only 6 steps away. Cleaning it would make the river clean, enabling apples to spawn. Since the nearest apple is 6 steps away and the dirt is also 6 steps away, both are equally distant.

Now, evaluating the options:

1. **Eat an apple immediately?**  
   There are no apples visible in my current vicinity. The

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 6).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 6).

Reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away — quite far, and there's no immediate apple within reach. Eating it now would give only +1.0 point, but it's not a practical or strategic move given the distance and the absence of nearby apples.
- The dirt at (7, 6) is only 1 unit away — extremely close. Cleaning it will reduce the total dirt in the environment, which directly improves the river's cleanliness.
- The rule states that apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. So, cleaning dirt is not just a passive action — it's a prerequisite for future apple spawning. This means that by cleaning this dirt, I'm enabling the possibility of apples appearing in areas that may otherwise remain barren.
- There is no immediate reward for cleaning, but the long-term benefit is critical: more apples in the future, which can be eaten by the group (including me) to maximize total points.
- Since I have high-level navigation and interaction functions, I can move to (7, 6) and clean it efficiently without wasting time or resources.

Therefore, the strategic choice is to clean the dirt

  Obs: You are at (4, 1). You see an apple at (2, 1).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (2, 1).

Reasoning:

- The apple is at (2, 1), which is only 2 steps away — a very short distance. Since I can move only in cardinal directions (up, down, left, right), I can reach it in 2 moves (left to (3,1), then left to (2,1)).
- The immediate reward of +1.0 for eating an apple is valuable and provides tangible points with no risk or cost.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 6), which is 8 units away — far beyond the immediate vicinity. Cleaning it would require significant effort and time, and there's no indication that apples will spawn in the near future without it. Moreover, since apples are already present at (2,1), the current state of the world already supports apple spawning, meaning the river is currently clean enough to allow apples to exist.
- There is no immediate benefit to cleaning dirt at this moment — it's not urgent, and the apple is already available.
- Since the goal is to maximize points, and I can gain a point immediately by eating the apple without any cost or risk, it's rational to take that action first.

Therefore, I should

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 1). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully.

I am at position (7, 1). The nearest apple is at (2, 1), which is 5 units away — directly to the left along the same row. That’s a clear path: I can move left one step at a time to reach it. Eating an apple would give me +1.0 immediately, which is a straightforward reward.

However, the nearest dirt is at (7, 6), also 5 units away — directly above me. Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning in the future, which benefits the group. But cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward. The trade-off is between immediate personal gain and long-term group benefit.

But here's the key point: **apples only spawn when the river is clean**. So, if I don’t clean the dirt, apples won’t spawn at all — even if I go to (2,1) and eat one, future apples may not appear. Since apples are the only source of points, and the only way to gain points is by eating them, I must ensure that apples can spawn in the future.

   - But once cleaned, the

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (10, 2). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: Given the current situation, I need to carefully analyze the trade-offs between immediate reward and long-term benefit.

I am at (10, 2). The nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 5 units away — a moderate distance. The nearest dirt is at (7, 3), which is only 4 units away. This is significant because dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning. Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when there is less dirt). Therefore, cleaning dirt is not just a maintenance task — it's a prerequisite for future apple generation.

Right now, there are no apples visible nearby, and I see nothing of interest. Eating an apple would give me +1.0 immediately, but the apple at (13, 0) is far away and would require movement. More importantly, if I don't clean the dirt at (7, 3), future apple spawning will be blocked, which directly harms the group's ability to earn points over time.

The key insight is that **cleaning dirt enables future apple spawning**, and since apples are the primary source of points, this action has long-term value. Even though there's no immediate reward, the ability to spawn apples later (

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 6). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 3), even though there's no immediate reward.

Reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (3, 6), which is 4 units away — a reasonable distance, but it's not directly accessible without first ensuring the river is clean.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 3), just 3 units away — very close and within reach.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean. This means cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple spawning. Without cleaning, no apples can appear, even if they are nearby.
- Eating an apple now (at (3,6)) would give +1.0, but only if it's already available. However, since apples don't spawn without clean water, and the global scan indicates no current apple at (7,6), it's likely the apple at (3,6) is not currently active or is dependent on the river state.
- The river’s cleanliness is a systemic condition — cleaning dirt improves the environment for future apple growth. This is a group-level benefit that enables long-term rewards.
- Since I’m at (7,6), moving to (7,3) is only 3 steps down (south), which is

--- Step 43 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (11, 7). You see an apple at (13, 6), an apple at (13, 7) and an apple at (13, 8).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 3) — even though it's far away and doesn't offer immediate reward.

Here's why:

- Apples only spawn when the river is clean, meaning dirt must be removed to enable apple spawning. Right now, there are apples at (13,6), (13,7), and (13,8), which suggests the river *is* currently clean in that region. However, the presence of dirt at (7,3) implies that the system is not fully clean — and if that dirt remains, it may prevent future apple spawns in other areas or reduce the overall apple availability over time.

- The nearest apple is at (13,7), just 2 steps away. Eating it gives +1.0 immediately, which seems tempting. But this apple is already present — it's not dependent on cleaning dirt. So, eating it now doesn't address the long-term sustainability of apple spawning.

- However, if we don’t clean the dirt at (7,3), future apple spawns may be blocked or reduced. Since the goal is to *maximize points over time* (not just in the short term), and apples are the only source of points, the long-term benefit of

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (9, 2). You see dirt at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 3).

Reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (5, 0), which is 6 units away. That’s a significant distance, and since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), there’s no immediate apple available now — the current dirt at (7,3) prevents apple spawning.
- The dirt at (7,3) is only 3 units away from my current position (9,2). That makes it a reachable and immediate target.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0, but there are no apples visible in the current state — the global scan shows no apple in immediate range, and apple spawning is conditional on clean rivers.
- Cleaning dirt is not rewarding immediately, but it enables future apple spawning. Since apples are the primary source of points, and they only appear when the river is clean, cleaning dirt is a necessary prerequisite for long-term progress.
- The trade-off is between immediate reward (eating an apple) and enabling future rewards (cleaning dirt). However, there are no apples currently available to eat — they require clean conditions to spawn. Thus, the only viable path to earning points is to create conditions for apple spawning
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 3}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision as Agent 3.

Current position: (7, 5)  
Nearest apple: (3, 6) — distance 5  
Nearest dirt: (7, 3) — distance 2  

Immediate options:
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.  
- Cleaning dirt improves the river's cleanliness, which enables apples to spawn in the future.  
- Apples only spawn *when the river is clean*, meaning dirt must be removed to allow apple generation.  

Key insight:  
Apples do not spawn unless the river is clean. Right now, there is dirt at (7, 3), just 2 units away. Since I’m at (7, 5), moving to (7, 4), then (7, 3) is straightforward — a simple vertical move (no diagonals). Cleaning that dirt would improve the environment for future apple spawning.

But:  
The nearest apple is 5 units away — far from immediate reach. Eating it would give a small immediate reward, but it's not guaranteed to be available long-term. If the river is dirty, apples won’t spawn at all. So, if I eat the apple now

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (10, 7). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: Given the current situation, I need to carefully analyze the trade-off between immediate rewards and long-term benefits.

I am at (10, 7). The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is just 3 steps away — a short, feasible journey. Eating that apple would give me +1.0 point immediately. This seems like a straightforward, low-effort gain.

However, the nearest dirt is at (7, 3), which is 7 steps away. Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apples to spawn in the future, which benefits the group. But cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward — it's a "setup" action. The key question is: *Is there a risk of missing future apples if I don’t clean the dirt?*

Right now, there are no apples visible nearby, and the apple at (13, 7) is the nearest. If I don’t clean the dirt, apples may not spawn at all — or at least not in the future. That means I might miss opportunities to earn points later.

But here's the important point: **Apples only spawn when the river is clean**. So, unless the dirt is cleaned, apples won’t appear — even if they're close. The

--- Step 41 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 4). You see dirt at (6, 5) and agent 3 at (6, 5).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 5).

Here’s the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 steps away. That means it's not immediately accessible, and there's no apple in the immediate vicinity (within 1 step). Therefore, eating an apple now is not feasible — there’s no apple within reach.
- There is dirt at (6, 5), directly adjacent to my current position (6, 4). This dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning in the future, especially since apples only appear when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt).
- The global scan shows that cleaning dirt has no immediate reward, but it is essential for enabling future apple spawns — which benefits the group and increases long-term points.
- Agent 3 is currently at (6, 5), which suggests they may be trying to clean or interact with the dirt. However, without knowing their intentions or whether they’ve already cleaned it, we can’t assume it’s done. If they’re standing there, it might be a sign that they are also attempting to clean it — but since they’re not moving, it’s possible they are stuck or not progressing.
- Since I can move only in cardinal
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 5}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 0). You see dirt at (6, 0).
  Thinking: I am at (6, 0), where there is dirt. The nearest apple is at (1, 0), which is 5 units away — a significant distance. There is no apple currently visible at my position, and the only dirt is at (6, 0), which I'm standing on.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple at (6, 0) — only dirt. Eating an apple is not possible right now. Even if there were an apple nearby, it would require movement and would not be available immediately. Since the nearest apple is 5 steps away, and we don’t know if it’s accessible or if it will remain there, this option is not viable now.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   This is a key point. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed). Currently, the dirt at (6, 0) is blocking apple spawning in that area. Removing it would allow apples to spawn on land in that region. Since the nearest apple is at (1, 0), which is on the same horizontal line, and the dirt is at
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 5). You see agent 1 at (6, 4), dirt at (6, 5) and dirt at (7, 6).
  Thinking: I am at (6, 5), and I observe that there is dirt at (6, 5) and (7, 6). The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 4 steps away. However, currently, there is no apple visible at my current location — the only apple is far away and not immediately accessible. 

Crucially, the rule states that **apples only spawn on land when the river is clean** — meaning that dirt must be removed to enable apple spawning. Right now, I am standing on dirt at (6, 5), which means I cannot eat an apple from this location. Moreover, the presence of dirt prevents apple spawning in that area and nearby regions.

The key trade-off is:

- **Eating an apple**: I cannot eat an apple at (6, 5) because it's dirt. The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 4 steps away — but to reach it, I must first ensure the path is clean. There's no indication that apples are spawning nearby due to current dirt, so even if I walk to (2, 5), the apple may not be there unless the river is clean.

- **Cleaning dirt**: Removing dirt

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 4). You see agent 3 at (6, 5).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the trade-off carefully based on the current situation.

Currently, I am at (6, 4), and I see Agent 3 at (6, 5) — directly above me. The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 steps away. That’s a significant distance. The nearest dirt is at (7, 6), which is only 3 steps away — very close. 

Key point: Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. So, if I don’t clean dirt, apples won’t appear — even if I walk far to reach them. Cleaning dirt is not immediately rewarding, but it enables future apple spawns. Since the nearest apple is far away (5 steps), and no apples are currently visible or spawnable, I must consider whether it's worth cleaning dirt now to enable future apple generation.

Option 1: Eat an apple immediately — but there’s no apple in my vicinity. The nearest is 5 steps away. I can't eat one now. So this option is not viable.

Option 2: Clean dirt — this is the only action that enables future apple spawning. The dirt is at (7,6), just 3 steps away. I can reach it
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 6}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 0). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: Given the current situation:

- You are at (6, 0).
- The nearest apple is at (1, 0), which is 5 units away — directly to the left along the x-axis.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 6), which is 7 units away (down and right), meaning it's farther than the apple.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — i.e., when dirt is removed. Cleaning dirt enables future apple spawning, which benefits the group.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately, but apples only spawn *after* dirt is cleaned, so there's a delay between cleaning and apple availability.

### Trade-off Analysis:

**Option 1: Eat an apple now**
- Immediate +1.0 point.
- However, the apple at (1,0) is already present — it doesn't require cleaning to exist. So, it's available now.
- But: if you eat it, you don't gain any long-term benefit. You still have to clean dirt to enable more apples in the future.

**Option 2: Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning**
- Dirt at (7,6) is 7 units away — far from your current position.
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 1, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 5). You see agent 1 at (6, 4) and dirt at (7, 6).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision as Agent 3.

Current position: (6, 5)  
Agent 1 is at (6, 4) — directly north of me.  
There's dirt at (7, 6) — southeast of me.  
Nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 4 steps away.  
Nearest dirt is at (7, 6), which is only 2 steps away (down-right to (7,6)).

Key considerations:

1. **Immediate reward vs. long-term benefit**:  
   Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately. But apples only spawn *when the river is clean* — meaning cleaning dirt is a prerequisite. Without cleaning dirt, no apples can spawn. So, if I eat an apple now, I'm consuming a resource that may not be sustainable or available in the future. If the dirt remains uncleaned, apples won’t spawn, and future points are lost.

2. **Dirt at (7,6)**:  
   This is the nearest dirt. Cleaning it is a necessary step to enable apple spawning. Since the nearest apple is 4 steps away, and the dirt is only 2 steps

--- Step 43 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
Therefore, the optimal action is to eat the apple at (1, 0) now — it's safe, efficient, and aligns with maximizing immediate points. Afterward, I can plan a future route to clean dirt if needed, but only when it becomes strategically relevant.
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 1, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 0). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 1 at (1, 1).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Here's the reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only 1 step away — a direct, low-effort action that gives a clear +1.0 reward with no risk.
- The nearest dirt is at (8, 2), which is 8 steps away. Cleaning it would require significant movement and time, with no immediate benefit. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, this is a long-term strategy, not a current necessity.
- There is no immediate threat or urgent need to clean dirt — agent 1 is at (1, 1), which is adjacent, but there's no indication they are a threat or blocking access.
- The apple at (1, 0) is on land and within reach. Eating it provides immediate value and doesn't prevent future actions — I can still later clean dirt or explore other areas after gaining a point.

Thus, the immediate reward outweighs the delayed benefit of cleaning dirt. In a cleanup game where the goal is to maximize points, acting on available opportunities is optimal when they are both accessible and beneficial.

→ **Action: Eat the apple at (1, 0).**
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 1, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see dirt at (8, 2).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the current situation and make a strategic decision based on the rules and goals.

Currently, I am at (7, 3). The nearest dirt is at (8, 2), which is only one step away (distance 1, not 2 — the global scan may have a typo). This dirt is directly adjacent, making it easily accessible. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 steps away — far from immediate reach.

Key points:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed). So, cleaning dirt is not just a task — it's a prerequisite for future apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediate reward, but only if an apple is present.
- There is no apple visible in the immediate vicinity (nearest is at (12, 2), which is far away and requires cleaning the path first).
- The dirt at (8, 2) is adjacent — I can move there and clean it in one step.

Therefore:
- I cannot eat an apple now because there is no apple in range. The apple at (12, 2) is not spawnable until the river is clean, and even

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (1, 1). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 2 at (2, 0).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Here's the reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only 1 step away — this is the closest apple to me, and I can consume it directly with no risk or cost.
- Eating an apple gives a clear +1.0 reward, which directly increases my score. Since I am in a cleanup game where points are scored by eating apples, and there is no immediate penalty for eating an apple, this is a safe and beneficial action.
- The dirt at (7, 2) is far away (distance 7), and cleaning it would require a long journey. There is no indication that future apple spawns will occur in a way that justifies such a long-term, low-immediate-reward action — especially since apples are already available now.
- Agent 2 is at (2, 0), which is adjacent to the apple at (1, 0). If agent 2 is also trying to eat it, there may be a conflict. However, since I am at (1,1), I can reach the apple before agent 2 moves — and the apple is not locked or guarded. There's no rule stating that multiple agents can't eat the same apple, but in
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 1, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 0). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 1 at (1, 1).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Here's the reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only 1 step away — this is a direct, low-effort, high-reward opportunity. Eating it gives me +1.0 point instantly, which improves my score immediately.
- The dirt at (7, 2) is far away (distance 7), and cleaning it would take significant time and movement. There is no immediate benefit from cleaning it — no apples are spawning now, and there's no indication that future apple spawns will occur unless the river is clean. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, cleaning dirt is a long-term investment with delayed returns.
- Agent 1 is at (1, 1), which is adjacent to the apple at (1, 0). If I don't act now, agent 1 might eat the apple before me, reducing my reward. Since I cannot move diagonally, I can only reach (1, 0) from (2, 0) by moving left to (1, 0) — a single step. I must act quickly to secure the apple.
- There is no nearby dirt to clean, and no other immediate opportunities. Therefore, the only viable

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 3). You see dirt at (7, 2) and dirt at (8, 2).
  Thinking: I am at (8, 3). I observe dirt at (7, 2) and (8, 2). The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away. The nearest dirt is at (8, 2), just one step away — directly below me.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple in immediate range. The nearest apple is 5 steps away, and I have no information about apple spawning conditions at that location. Eating an apple requires being on land with an apple, and currently, there is no visible apple nearby. So, immediate apple consumption is not feasible. Even if I move toward (12, 2), I’d have to pass through or clean dirt first — and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed). So, eating an apple now is not possible.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   This is critical. Dirt blocks apple spawning. The current dirt at (8,2) is only one step away — I can walk there and clean it. Removing this dirt would improve the river’s cleanliness, which increases the likelihood of

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (1, 1). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 2 at (2, 0).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only 1 step away — this gives me a direct +1.0 reward with no risk or cost.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 2), which is 7 steps away — cleaning it would take significant time and effort, and there’s no immediate benefit from doing so. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, this is a long-term strategy that doesn't contribute to my current score or survival.
- There is no threat or obstruction from Agent 2 at (2, 0) — they are not in a position to interfere with my movement or actions, and I can safely move to (1, 0) to eat the apple.
- The goal is to maximize points, and eating an apple gives immediate, tangible points. Delaying this action for a future benefit (cleaning dirt) introduces risk and time delay without guaranteed return.

Therefore, the optimal immediate action is to eat the apple at (1, 0). This maximizes my current score and aligns with the core objective of the game. Cleaning dirt should be considered later, once I have a better understanding of the broader environment or when it becomes necessary

Agent 2 (High-Level):
- Agent 3 is at (6, 3), which is one step away — they may also be trying to collect apples or clean. But since they are not in a position to help with the dirt at (6, 1), and we are in a cooperative environment,
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 3). You see agent 2 at (6, 2).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the trade-off between immediate reward and long-term group benefit.

Currently, I am at (6, 3), and I see Agent 2 at (6, 2). The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 7 units away — quite far. The nearest dirt is at (6, 1), just 1 unit below me. That means I can reach the dirt in one move down to (6, 1), and cleaning it would improve the river's cleanliness, enabling apple spawning in the future.

However, I have no apple in immediate range. The apple at (12, 2) is far away and would require a long path. There's no apple spawning at my current location or nearby — the only apples are far off, and they depend on the river being clean.

Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it's essential for future apple spawning. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and clean rivers are created by removing dirt, cleaning now directly enables future apple generation. This supports the group's long-term goal.

Moreover, since I'm already close to the dirt (only one step away), and the dirt is a prerequisite for apple spawning, it's a high

--- Step 42 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 0). You see dirt at (6, 1).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 1).

Reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 7 units away — far beyond immediate reach.
- The only dirt visible is at (6, 1), just one step away. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), cleaning this dirt is essential to enable future apple spawning.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 immediately, but there are no apples available at (6, 0) or nearby. Without cleaning dirt, the river remains dirty, and apples will not spawn — meaning no apples will be available in the future, even if I move toward (13, 0).
- Cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apple spawning. It provides no immediate reward, but it enables future rewards. In a long-term cleanup game where the goal is to maximize points, enabling future apple spawns is more strategically valuable than a one-time gain from a non-existent apple.
- Since I am at (6, 0) and dirt is at (6, 1), I can move down to (6, 1) and clean it
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 2). You see dirt at (6, 1) and agent 3 at (6, 3).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 1).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — far out of reach in a single path. There are no apples visible nearby, and the only dirt visible is at (6, 1), just one step away.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 point, but there are no apples in immediate proximity. The apple at (12, 2) is not accessible without first cleaning dirt to enable apple spawning.
- The rule states that apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned to allow apples to appear. Since we are at (6, 2) and there's dirt directly below at (6, 1), cleaning it is a necessary step to enable future apple spawns.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it is a prerequisite for future apple generation. Without cleaning, no apples will appear — meaning no opportunity to earn points in the future.
- Agent 3 is at (6, 3), which is adjacent to us — they may be trying to clean or collect, but since we are at (6, 2), we have a direct path
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 3). You see agent 2 at (6, 2).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision as Agent 3.

Current position: (6, 3)  
Agent 2 is at (6, 2) — directly below me, so we're in the same column.  
Nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 7 units away (rightward).  
Nearest dirt is at (6, 1), which is only 1 unit below me — very close.  

Key point: Apples only spawn when the river is clean. Dirt cleaning is necessary to enable apple spawning. But cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward — it's a prerequisite for future apple growth.

So, trade-off:
- **Option 1: Eat an apple** — immediate +1.0 point. But the nearest apple is at (12, 2), 7 steps away. That’s far, and there’s no indication of nearby apples. Also, if I eat an apple, I’m not helping the group's long-term goal of enabling future apple spawns.
- **Option 2: Clean dirt at (6, 1)** — only 1 step down. This directly supports the river being clean, which increases the chance of apples spawning in the future

--- Step 43 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 0). You see dirt at (6, 1).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 1).

Here's the reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 7 units away — far beyond immediate reach.
- The only dirt present is at (6, 1), just one step away. This is the only dirt in the global scan, and it's directly adjacent to my current position.
- Apples only spawn *when the river is clean*, meaning that dirt must be removed to enable apple spawning. Cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple availability — it doesn't give immediate reward, but it enables long-term gains.
- Eating an apple now is not feasible because no apple is within reach. Even if one were, the immediate reward would be zero given the distance.
- Since the dirt is adjacent and cleaning it is a low-effort, high-impact action (it enables future apple spawning), it makes perfect sense to prioritize it.
- This action supports the group's goal of maximizing apple availability over time, which aligns with the objective of maximizing points in the long run.

Therefore, I should move to (6, 1) and clean the dirt. This sets the foundation for future apple spawning
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 2). You see dirt at (6, 1) and agent 3 at (6, 3).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 1).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — far enough that immediate consumption is not practical or efficient.
- The dirt at (6, 1) is only 1 unit away — very close and directly accessible from my current position (6, 2).
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed). Since there's currently dirt at (6, 1), no apples can spawn in that area or nearby — meaning the group cannot gain apples until this dirt is cleaned.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning, which is essential for long-term point accumulation and group success.
- There is no immediate benefit to eating an apple here — the nearest one is far away, and even if I could reach it, it would take significant time and effort.
- Agent 3 is at (6, 3), which is adjacent and possibly a potential coordination point — but since they are not actively interfering or blocking, and no threat is indicated, I don’t need to avoid them.

Therefore, the trade-off favors cleaning the dirt: it enables future apple spawning
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
   → Yes. Dirt at (6, 0) is present and must be cleaned to allow apples to spawn. Apples only appear on land when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt). Cleaning this dirt directly contributes to enabling apple spawning in the future. Even though cleaning gives no immediate reward, it's a necessary step for long-term gains — especially since apples are the only source of points. Since apples are far away (at (1,0)), and we don

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 5). You see agent 1 at (6, 4), dirt at (6, 5) and dirt at (7, 6).
  Thinking: I am at (6, 5), and I see agent 1 at (6, 4). There is dirt at (6, 5) and (7, 6). The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 4 units away — that's a significant distance. Currently, there is dirt at my current location, which means apples cannot spawn here yet. The rule states that apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed). So, cleaning dirt is essential for future apple spawning.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple** — There is no apple at (6, 5) or nearby. The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 4 steps away. To reach it, I’d need to move through potentially dirty terrain. Since there’s no apple currently visible or accessible, eating one isn't possible immediately. Even if I could reach it, it would take time and effort, and there’s no immediate reward available. So, this option is not viable right now.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning** — This is critical. Dirt at (6, 5) and (7, 6) prevents

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 4). You see agent 3 at (6, 5).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 6) to enable future apple spawning.

Here's my reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away. While eating an apple would give +1.0 immediately, it's far from me and requires a long path to reach.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 6), only 3 units away — very close and directly reachable from my current position (6, 4).
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean. Cleaning dirt is not rewarding immediately, but it's a prerequisite for future apple generation. Without cleaning, apples won't spawn — meaning no future reward.
- Since I'm at (6, 4), I can move to (7, 6) in one step (right), then clean it. This is a minimal effort for maximum long-term benefit.
- Agent 3 is at (6, 5), just one step above me — they may be attempting to eat apples or clean too. But since apples require clean river conditions, if we both clean dirt, the system becomes more productive for the group.
- There's no nearby apple spawn point that can be accessed without first cleaning dirt. Therefore, cleaning dirt
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 6}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 0). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I am at (6, 0). The nearest apple is at (1, 0), which is 5 units away — a manageable distance. However, the nearest dirt is at (7, 6), which is 7 units away. This suggests that apples are currently not spawning because the river is not clean.

But here's the key: **apples only spawn when the river is clean**. Since there is no apple visible near me, and the nearest apple is far away (5 units), it's likely that the apple at (1,0) is not spawning because the dirt hasn't been cleaned. So, eating that apple now would be pointless — it may not even be accessible or viable in the long run.

Furthermore, cleaning dirt is necessary to enable future apple spawning. The dirt at (7,6) is 7 units away — it's not immediately adjacent, but it's reachable. Since I have a high-level navigation function, I can plan a path to reach it.

Now, considering the trade-off:

- **Eating an apple now** gives +1.0, but if the apple isn't actually spawnable (due to dirty river), it might not exist or be accessible. There's no indication that apples are

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 5). You see agent 1 at (6, 4) and dirt at (7, 6).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation as Agent 3 to determine the best course of action.

Current position: (6, 5)  
Agent 1 is at (6, 4) — directly above me, so we're in the same column.  
There is dirt at (7, 6), which is 1 step east and 1 step north from my current position — a distance of √2, but since I can't move diagonally, I must move in two separate steps.  
The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 4 units west — a significant distance.  
The nearest dirt is at (7, 6), distance 2 (in Manhattan distance: 1 east + 1 north = 2 steps).

Now, evaluating the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 4 units away. That would require moving west to (5,5), then (4,5), (3,5), (2,5). That's a long path, and no apple is visible nearby. There's no indication of any apple spawning near me currently — apples only spawn when the river is clean

--- Step 43 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 4). You see agent 3 at (7, 5).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

You are currently at (7, 4).  
Agent 3 is at (7, 5) — directly to your right, so they are in close proximity.  
The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 units away — a long distance.  
The nearest dirt is at (7, 6), which is just one step north from you — distance 2.  

### Option 1: Eat an apple for immediate reward  
- Apples spawn only when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed).  
- Right now, there is dirt at (7, 6), and apples are not spawning because the river is not clean.  
- Therefore, **no apple is available to eat** at this moment — even if you were to move to (2, 5), there's no guarantee it would spawn an apple unless the river is clean.  
- Eating an apple is not possible right now. So this option is invalid.  

### Option 2: Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning  
- Dirt at (7, 6) is only 2 steps away — very accessible.  
- Cleaning this dirt will improve the river's cleanliness, which
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 6}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 0). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I am at (7, 0). The nearest apple is at (1, 0), which is 6 units away — a significant distance. The nearest dirt is at (7, 6), also 6 units away. 

Right now, I see nothing of interest nearby, and there are no visible apples or dirt in immediate proximity. This means I cannot eat an apple immediately, and there's no dirt to clean right now.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple?**  
   → There is no apple in immediate range. The nearest apple is 6 steps away, and I have no information about whether it's accessible or if it will spawn. Since I can't see or interact with it directly, and no apple is visible, I cannot eat one now. Eating an apple would require movement and would only be beneficial if the apple were present and reachable. So, **not viable now**.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   → The dirt is at (7, 6), which is directly above me (same x, 6 units up). This is within reach. Cleaning dirt is necessary to allow apples to spawn later — it's a prerequisite for long-term rewards. Even though
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 6}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see agent 1 at (7, 4) and dirt at (7, 6).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 6).

Here's the reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible in my immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away — far beyond immediate reach.
- The only dirt I can interact with is at (7, 6), just one step away. This is the closest dirt to me, and cleaning it would be a low-effort, high-impact action for the group.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning that dirt must be removed to enable apple spawning. Since apples are essential for scoring, and they don’t spawn on dirty land, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple availability.
- Eating an apple now is not feasible because there are no apples nearby. Even if I could reach one, it would take many steps and would not be efficient given the long distance.
- Cleaning dirt (even without immediate reward) enables future apple spawning, which benefits the entire group and increases overall points in the long run.
- The rule explicitly states that cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward but is necessary to enable apple spawning — so the trade-off is clear: no immediate gain, but critical infrastructure for future gains.

Therefore, the optimal action is to clean the dirt at (8, 3). This action sets the stage for future apple spawning, which will eventually allow me to collect apples when they become available. Without cleaning, apples will not

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 1). You see dirt at (6, 0) and agent 1 at (6, 0).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to determine the best course of action.

Current position: (6, 1)  
Dirt at (6, 0) — directly below me, only 1 step away  
Agent 1 is at (6, 0) — same location as the dirt  
Nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 7 steps away  
No apples are currently visible or accessible — the river is not clean, so apples don’t spawn  
The rule states: apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (less dirt). So, to get apples, I must first clean dirt.

Immediate reward: eating an apple gives +1.0 point, but there are no apples available at the moment. I cannot eat one without it being present. So, **option 1 is not feasible**.

Option 2: Clean the dirt at (6, 0).  
- This is directly adjacent and within reach.  
- Cleaning dirt has no immediate reward, but it is essential to enable future apple spawning.  
- Since the nearest apple is 7 steps away, and apples only spawn when the river is clean, cleaning this dirt is a prerequisite for any apple access.

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 0). You see agent 3 at (6, 1).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to make the best decision given the rules and objectives.

Current position: (6, 0)  
Agent 3 is at (6, 1) — directly above me, so no immediate conflict or risk.  
Nearest apple is at (13, 0), 7 units away — that’s a long distance.  
Nearest dirt is at (8, 3), distance 5 — which is closer than the apple.  

Key rules:
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned).
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but enables future apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.
- You cannot move diagonally — only up, down, left, right.

### Trade-off Analysis:

**Option 1: Eat an apple immediately**
- The nearest apple is 7 units away — very far.
- There’s no apple in immediate vicinity (within 1 or 2 steps).
- Eating an apple would require moving to (13, 0), which is a long journey with no immediate benefit.
- Even if I eat one, it’s a small gain (+1.0), and I’d still
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 3}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 3). You see dirt at (8, 3).
  Thinking: I am at (8, 3), and I see dirt there. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — a moderate distance. However, apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, meaning that dirt must be cleaned before apples can appear. Right now, there is dirt at (8, 3), and since apples don’t spawn on dirty land, I cannot eat an apple at this location or any nearby land that is still contaminated.

The key point is: **apples only spawn when dirt is cleaned**. So, eating an apple is not possible right now because the land is dirty. Even if I were to move toward the apple at (12, 2), unless the path is clean, I won’t be able to access it — and the apple may not even spawn until the river (or relevant land) is cleaned.

Therefore, **I cannot eat an apple immediately** due to the current state of the environment.

Now, evaluating the options:

1. **Eat an apple?** — No. There is no apple visible on clean land. The dirt at (8, 3) prevents apple spawning. Eating an apple would be impossible and would result in a loss of potential

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 1). You see agent 1 at (6, 0).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to make the best decision as Agent 3.

Current position: (6, 1)  
Agent 1 is at (6, 0) — directly below me, so they are adjacent. This suggests possible coordination or competition, though no direct conflict is stated.

Global scan:
- Nearest apple: (12, 2) — distance = 7 units
- Nearest dirt: (8, 3) — distance = 4 units

Key observations:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned). So, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediate reward.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward but enables future apple spawning — which benefits the group.
- The dirt is only 4 units away, which is much closer than the apple (7 units).
- Since apples require clean river conditions, and the dirt is relatively close, cleaning it would unlock future apple spawns — potentially enabling more apples to appear in the future, which could be harvested by multiple agents.

Trade-off:
1. **Eat an apple now?**  
   - Immediate reward: +1.0  
   - But the apple is

Moving from (7, 0) towards (13, 0).
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 0). You see agent 3 at (7, 1).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

You are currently at (7, 0). Agent 3 is at (7, 1), directly above you — a close proximity that might suggest coordination or competition, but no immediate action is required unless there's a threat or opportunity.

**Global Scan Summary:**
- Nearest Apple: at (13, 0), distance = 6 steps.
- Nearest Dirt: *None found*.

This is critical.

**Key Rule Reminder:**  
Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt has been cleaned). Currently, there is *no dirt* listed in the global scan. That suggests either:
- The dirt is far away (not in the immediate vicinity), or
- The dirt has already been cleaned, or
- The system is misreported.

But the absence of dirt means there is *no dirt to clean*, so **cleaning dirt is not possible right now**. Therefore, **option 2 (cleaning dirt)** is not feasible — it's not an available action.

**Option 1: Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
The nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 6 steps away. That means you
  Decision: {'action': 'move_to', 'args': {'coord_x': 13, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 3). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: The current observation shows that you are at (8, 3), and there is no visible dirt nearby in the global scan. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — a moderate distance, but not out of reach. However, the critical detail is that **there is no dirt listed in the global scan**, meaning there is currently no dirt to clean.

Let’s analyze the trade-offs:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   - Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.  
   - However, apples only spawn *when the river is clean* (i.e., when dirt has been removed).  
   - Since no dirt is currently visible or reported, and apples are not spawning, it is likely that **apples are not available at all right now** — even if we move toward (12, 2), there’s no guarantee it will spawn.  
   - Therefore, **eating an apple is not possible** at this moment — there is no apple in the vicinity that you can access.  
   - So, this option is not viable.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   - This is a long-term strategy.
  Decision: {'action': 'random_explore', 'args': {}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 1). You see agent 1 at (7, 0).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

You are at (7, 1). Agent 1 is at (7, 0), directly below you. The global scan shows:
- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away.
- There is **no dirt** visible in the global scan.

This is a critical point: **Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt has been cleaned).** Currently, there is no dirt listed — which suggests either:
- The dirt is not visible in the global scan (maybe it's hidden or far away), or
- The river is already clean, and apples can spawn naturally.

But the rule says: *Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (less dirt = more apples)*. So if there's no dirt, that implies the river is already clean — meaning apples **can** spawn now.

However, the global scan says "Nearest Dirt: None found" — which may mean there is no dirt currently detectable. That could imply that the river is already clean, so apple spawning is already enabled.

Therefore:
  Obs: You are at (7, 4). You see agent 3 at (7, 5).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to determine the best course of action.

Currently, I am at (7, 4), and I see Agent 3 at (7, 5) — they are just one step away. The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 steps away. That means it's not immediately accessible. The nearest dirt is at (7, 6), which is just one step north from my current position — distance 2. Cleaning dirt is essential because apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when there's less dirt). So, cleaning dirt enables future apple spawning, which benefits the group.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple**: There's no apple in immediate range. The nearest is 6 steps away, and I don't have any apple in sight. Eating one would give +1.0, but I can't do that without first reaching it. Since I’m not near any apple, this option isn't viable now.

2. **Clean dirt**: The dirt at (7, 6) is only 2 steps away. Cleaning it would take a small amount of time and effort but would improve the river’s cleanliness, enabling future
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 6}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (5, 0). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully.

I am at (5, 0). The nearest apple is at (1, 0), which is 4 units away — directly to the left along the x-axis. That means I can reach it in 4 moves (up/down/left/right only). Eating an apple would give me +1.0 immediately, which is a clear, direct reward.

However, the nearest dirt is at (7, 6), which is 8 units away — quite far. Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apples to spawn in the future, but it gives no immediate reward. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), cleaning dirt is a long-term investment that enables future apple spawning — which benefits the group.

But here's the key: **there is already an apple at (1, 0)**, and I can reach it directly. This means that the river is currently clean enough to allow apple spawning — so apples are already available. Therefore, there's no need to clean dirt *now* to enable apples, because apples are already present.

The trade-off is:  
- Eat apple now → immediate +1.0 point, no risk, no delay.  
-

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see agent 1 at (7, 4) and dirt at (7, 6).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 6).

Reasoning:

- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Currently, there is dirt at (7, 6), which is adjacent to my position (7, 5). This dirt is blocking apple spawning in that area.
- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away — far from my current position. Eating it immediately would give +1.0 point, but it's not accessible without first cleaning the dirt that prevents apple spawning in the region.
- Cleaning the dirt at (7, 6) will improve the river's cleanliness and enable future apple spawning, especially in the area near (7, 5) and (7, 6), which is currently blocked.
- Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and we have no immediate access to apples due to dirt, the immediate reward of eating an apple is not viable — there are no apples currently visible or reachable in a clean state.
- The dirt is only one step away, so cleaning it is a low-effort, high-impact action that enables future apple generation for the group.
- There is no nearby apple spawnable area currently due to dirt, so exploring

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 6) and agent 3 at (7, 6).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 6).

Reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away — quite far. Eating it would give +1.0 reward, but it's not immediately accessible and would require a long path.
- The dirt at (7, 6) is directly adjacent and is the nearest dirt patch. Cleaning it would improve the river's cleanliness, which increases the chance of apples spawning in the future — especially since apples only spawn when the river is clean.
- Agent 3 is currently at (7, 6), which suggests this location may be a point of conflict or coordination. However, since I cannot move diagonally and must act strategically, I should consider whether cleaning dirt benefits the group more than taking a short-term reward.
- There is no immediate apple nearby, and the apple at (2, 5) is far away. Therefore, eating an apple now would be inefficient and not aligned with long-term goals.
- Cleaning dirt is a necessary prerequisite for apple spawning. Without cleaning, no apples can appear — so this action is foundational to future rewards.
- Since I am Agent 1 and the goal is to maximize points *over time* (not just immediate
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 6}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (4, 0). You see an apple at (2, 1).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (2, 1).

Here's the reasoning:

- The apple at (2, 1) is within immediate reach — only one step away (from (4, 0) to (2, 1) is two steps left, then one up — total of 3 moves, but it's adjacent in a grid path). The global scan shows the nearest apple is at (1, 0), which is 3 steps away, so (2, 1) is actually closer than the global nearest apple — it's only 3 moves away (left to (3,0), then to (2,0), then up to (2,1)).

- The nearest dirt is at (7,6), which is 9 steps away — very far. Cleaning that dirt would take significant time and effort with no immediate benefit, and since apples only spawn *when the river is clean*, the dirt must be cleaned to enable future apple spawning. However, this is a long-term, indirect benefit.

- Eating the apple at (2,1) gives an immediate +1.0 point, which is valuable in a game where rewards are immediate and scarce. There’s no indication that cleaning dirt is urgent or that
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 2, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 6). You see agent 1 at (7, 5), dirt at (7, 6), dirt at (6, 7), dirt at (7, 7) and dirt at (8, 7).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 6), and the current observation shows that there is dirt at (7, 6), (6, 7), (7, 7), and (8, 7). This means the river is currently dirty at these points, and apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 units away. There is no apple visible in the immediate vicinity (like at (7, 6) or nearby). The only apple in the global scan is far away. Eating an apple would require reaching it, which involves traversing through potentially dirty areas. Since there's no apple nearby, and we are already at a dirt location, there’s no immediate apple to eat. Therefore, **eating an apple is not feasible right now**.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   Yes — dirt must be cleaned to allow apples to spawn. The current dirt at (7, 6), (6, 7), (7, 7), and (8, 7) blocks

--- Step 45 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see agent 3 at (7, 6).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am at (7, 5), and I see Agent 3 at (7, 6) — they are immediately adjacent, so there's a potential for coordination or conflict. However, the key factor is not just proximity to others, but the core game mechanics: apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed). 

Looking at the global scan:
- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away — a significant distance.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 7), just 2 units away from me.

This means I can reach the dirt in two steps (up to (7,6), then to (7,7)) — a very short and feasible path. Cleaning that dirt will contribute to making the river clean, which will eventually allow apples to spawn in areas that currently don’t have them. Since apples spawn only when the river is clean, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple generation.

Now, evaluating the trade-off:
- Since the goal is to maximize points, and eating an apple gives a direct +1.0 point, while cleaning dirt gives no immediate
  Decision: {'action': 'move_to', 'args': {'coord_x': 2, 'coord_y': 5}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (12, 5). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I should **clean the dirt at (7, 1)**.

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 7), which is only 2 steps away. Eating it would give me +1.0 immediately — a clear short-term reward.
- However, apples only spawn *when the river is clean*, and clean rivers require dirt to be removed. Right now, there's dirt at (7, 1), which is 9 units away. This dirt is likely blocking apple spawning in the broader area.
- The global scan indicates that the apple at (12, 7) might be a temporary or isolated spawn — without cleaning the dirt, future apple spawns (which are likely needed for long-term sustainability and group benefit) will not occur.
- Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, cleaning dirt is a *prerequisite* for future rewards. Without it, even if I eat the apple now, I will eventually be unable to access more apples.
- The distance to the dirt (9 units) is significant, but it's a one-time action that enables long-term access to apples. Moving to (7,1) would require a path through the map — though not immediately visible — and while it's

--- Step 44 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 1). You see dirt at (7, 0), dirt at (7, 1) and dirt at (6, 2).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation step by step.

**Current Position:** (7, 1)  
**Observations:**  
- Dirt at (7, 0), (7, 1), and (6, 2)  
- Nearest Apple: at (3, 1), distance = 4  
- Nearest Dirt: at (7, 1), distance = 0 → meaning we are currently *on* dirt  

**Rules Recap:**  
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed).  
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward.  
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point.  
- You cannot move diagonally.  

**Key Insight:**  
We are currently *on* dirt at (7,1), which means we are not on land. Apples only spawn on land. Therefore, **we cannot eat an apple at this moment** because there is no apple on land. The nearest apple is at (3,1), which is 4 units away — but to reach it, we must first reach land.

**Can we reach land?**  
Currently, we are at (7,1), which is on dirt. To get to land,
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 6). You see an apple at (2, 5).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (2, 5).

Reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available at a distance of just 1 step — this is the closest apple to me, and eating it gives a direct +1.0 reward with no risk or cost.
- There is no immediate benefit to cleaning dirt at (6, 2), which is 8 steps away. The dirt is far from my current position, and cleaning it would require significant movement with no guaranteed return in the short term.
- The rule states that apples only spawn when the river is clean — but this is a long-term condition. Since we are in a cleanup game and the goal is to maximize points, immediate action that yields reward (eating an apple) is more effective than delayed, uncertain actions.
- There is no indication that cleaning dirt will unlock any other apples in the near future, nor is there a known dependency between dirt cleaning and apple spawning that would make it worth delaying the immediate reward.

Therefore, the optimal strategy is to eat the apple at (2, 5) to gain immediate points. Afterward, I can plan to clean the dirt at (6, 2) when I have more time and resources, but right now, the best action is to maximize
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 2, 'coord_y': 5}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Moving from (11, 5) towards (12, 5).
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (11, 5). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: Given the current situation, I need to carefully analyze the trade-offs between immediate reward and long-term benefit.

**Current Position**: (11, 5)  
**Nearest Apple**: (12, 7) — distance = 3  
**Nearest Dirt**: (7, 1) — distance = 8  

The apple at (12, 7) is within reach — only 3 steps away. Since movement is restricted to cardinal directions (no diagonals), reaching it would take exactly 3 moves: right to (12,5), then up to (12,6), then up to (12,7). This is a short and feasible journey.

However, the dirt at (7,1) is far away — 8 steps away — and cleaning it would require a significant investment of time and movement. Since apples only spawn *when the river is clean* (i.e., when dirt is removed), cleaning dirt is essential for future apple spawning. But the immediate reward from eating an apple is +1.0, which is a direct point gain.

**Key considerations**:
- Eating an apple now gives **immediate +1.0 point**.
- Cleaning dirt has **no immediate reward**, but

--- Step 45 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 1). You see dirt at (7, 0) and dirt at (6, 2).
  Thinking: I should **clean the dirt at (7, 0)** — not eat an apple immediately, and not explore randomly.

Here’s the reasoning:

- **Immediate reward vs. long-term benefit**: Eating an apple gives +1.0 point, but apples only spawn *when the river is clean*. Right now, there is dirt at (7, 0) and (6, 2), and the global scan shows that apples only appear when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning.  
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 0), just one step away from my current position (7, 1). Cleaning it would reduce dirt in the system and improve the river’s cleanliness, which in turn increases the chance of apples spawning in the future — including at (3, 1), which is the nearest apple.  
- Eating an apple now would give a short-term gain, but if the river remains dirty, apples won’t spawn at all, and future opportunities are lost. Since apples are only available when clean, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for earning apples.  
- There’s no immediate apple available that can be eaten without first ensuring the environment supports its presence. The apple at (3, 1) is
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 5). You see an apple at (2, 5).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (2, 5).

Reasoning:

- The apple is directly at my current position (2, 5), so the distance is 0 — this means I can immediately access it with no movement cost.
- Eating an apple gives a direct reward of +1.0 point, which is a clear, immediate benefit.
- The nearest dirt is at (6, 2), which is 7 units away — this is far from my current position, and cleaning it would require significant movement and time.
- There is no immediate benefit to cleaning dirt in this situation because apples are already spawning (one is present at my location), and the rule states that apples only spawn when the river is clean — implying that clean river = more apples. Since we already have an apple, the river is already in a state that allows spawning. Thus, cleaning dirt is not urgent or necessary now.
- The trade-off between immediate reward and future benefit is heavily skewed: eating the apple provides instant value, while cleaning dirt provides no immediate reward and requires effort to reach a distant location.

Therefore, the optimal decision is to eat the apple. This maximizes immediate points, and since apples are already spawning (due to the current state), the system is already
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 2, 'coord_y': 5}} -> Env Action: 'eat'
Right now, the dirt at (7,6) is blocking apple spawning. If I clean it, I enable
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 6}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 6). You see dirt at (7, 6), dirt at (6, 7), dirt at (7, 7) and dirt at (8, 7).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 6), and the current observation shows that there is dirt at (7, 6), (6, 7), (7, 7), and (8, 7). The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 steps away — quite far. There is no apple currently visible in the immediate vicinity. 

The global scan confirms that the nearest dirt is at (7, 6), which is where I am standing. That means I am already on a dirt tile, and cleaning it would be a logical first step — not for immediate reward, but to enable future apple spawning. Apples only spawn when the river is clean, which implies that cleaning dirt reduces dirt and increases the chance of apples appearing on land.

Now, evaluating the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple nearby. The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 steps away. I cannot eat it immediately. Even if I move toward it, I would have to clean dirt along the way (since dirt blocks apple spawning), and no apple is currently available. Therefore, eating an apple is not feasible now.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future

--- Step 45 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (3, 1). You see an apple at (1, 0) and an apple at (2, 1).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (2, 1).

Reasoning:

- The apple at (2, 1) is immediately adjacent to my current position (3, 1), meaning I can reach it in one move. This provides a clear, immediate +1.0 reward with no risk or cost.
- The nearest dirt is at (6, 7), which is 9 units away — extremely distant. Cleaning it would require significant movement and time, and there is no immediate benefit or apple spawning expected in the near term. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and the dirt is far away, the long-term benefit is negligible compared to the immediate gain.
- There is no indication that cleaning dirt is urgent or necessary in the current state. The apple at (2, 1) is already available and within reach.
- Moving to clean dirt would delay my ability to earn points, which is a core objective. In a cleanup game where points are maximized, acting on immediate, accessible rewards is optimal unless there's a clear, high-value future benefit.

Therefore, the best decision is to eat the apple at (2, 1) — it gives immediate value, aligns with the primary goal, and avoids wasting time on a
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 2, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 7) to enable future apple spawning.

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — a significant distance. There's no immediate apple in sight, and we're at (7, 2), so moving to it would require traversing open terrain without any obvious benefit.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 7), also 5 units away. Dirt must be cleaned to allow apples to spawn. This means that without cleaning, apples will not appear at all — even if we're close to them.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 point, but there is no apple visible nearby. The global scan shows the nearest apple is 5 units away — we would have to travel there first. That path may not be safe or efficient, and more importantly, apples only spawn *after* the river is cleaned. So even if we eat an apple now, it's not a sustainable strategy.
- Cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple spawning. If we don't clean it, no apples will appear — regardless of how far we go. Since apples are the only source of points, preventing their spawning entirely would be
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 7}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 6). You see dirt at (6, 7), dirt at (7, 7) and dirt at (8, 7).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to determine the best course of action.

Currently, I am at (7, 6). I observe dirt at (6, 7), (7, 7), and (8, 7). The nearest dirt is at (7, 7), which is only one step away — a very short distance. This means I can easily reach and clean it. 

The global scan shows that the nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 steps away. That’s quite far, and there are no apples currently visible in the immediate vicinity. Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning, dirt must be removed to enable apple spawning. Since there is currently no apple at my location or nearby, I cannot eat one right now.

Option 1: Eating an apple for immediate reward — not viable. There are no apples visible or accessible in the current area. Even if I could reach one, it's far away and would require significant movement without any immediate benefit.

Option 2: Cleaning dirt to enable future apple spawning — this is critical. Removing dirt improves the environment, which allows apples to spawn. This action, while not rewarding immediately, is essential for long-term success. The dirt at

--- Step 46 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 1). You see an apple at (1, 0) and an apple at (2, 1).
  Thinking: I am at (2, 1), and I see an apple directly at my position — (2, 1). That means I can eat it immediately for +1.0 point. The global scan confirms that the nearest apple is at (2, 1), so this is a zero-distance, accessible apple.

Now, let's evaluate the trade-off:

1. **Should I eat the apple for immediate reward?**  
   Yes — there is no cost to eating it. It gives a clear, immediate +1.0 point. There's no risk, and it doesn't require any action beyond moving to that location (which I'm already at). Since I can't move diagonally, and I'm already at (2, 1), I can simply eat the apple right now. This is a safe, low-effort, high-reward action.

2. **Should I clean dirt to enable future apples?**  
   The nearest dirt is at (6, 7), which is 10 units away. Cleaning dirt is necessary for future apple spawning, but it doesn't provide immediate reward. Given that I’m currently at a position with an apple in range, and the dirt is far away, the effort to clean it now would

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully.

Currently, I am at (7, 3). The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — a significant distance. The nearest dirt is at (7, 7), which is only 4 units away — very close in the same column. 

Now, let's evaluate the options:

1. **Eating an apple for immediate reward**: There are no apples visible nearby. The nearest apple is 6 steps away, and I have no information about whether it's accessible or if there are other apples closer. Eating an apple would give +1.0, but it requires movement to reach it. Since I'm at (7,3) and the apple is at (12,2), I'd need to move right and down — which is a 6-step path. There's no indication that apples are spawning now, and since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), I can't assume there's an apple available to eat right now.

2. **Cleaning dirt to enable future apple spawning**: The dirt at (7,7) is only 4 units away — very close. Cleaning it would improve the river's
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 7}} -> Env Action: 'down'
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 3}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 2). You see dirt at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully.

Currently, I am at (8, 2), and I see dirt at (7, 3). The distance to that dirt is only 2 steps — very close. The nearest apple is at (5, 0), which is 5 steps away. That means I can reach the dirt quickly, but I would have to move to (7,3) first.

Now, consider the rules:
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed).
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.

Right now, there are no apples visible in my immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (5,0), which is 5 steps away — far from where I am. And there is dirt at (7,3), which is only 2 steps away. So, if I clean that dirt, I'm enabling the possibility of apples spawning in the future, which would benefit the group.

But if I eat an apple now, I get immediate +1.0, but the apple isn't nearby — I’d have to walk to (5,0), which takes
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 3}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 4). You see dirt at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 3).

Reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (5, 0), which is 6 units away — far from my current position at (7, 4). There is no immediate apple in close proximity (within 1-2 steps), so eating an apple now would not be practical or efficient.
- The dirt at (7, 3) is only 1 step away — very close and directly adjacent. Cleaning it will improve the river's cleanliness, which in turn increases the chance of apples spawning in the future, especially since apples only appear when the river is clean.
- While cleaning dirt provides no immediate reward, it is a necessary prerequisite for apple spawning. Since apples are the only source of points, and they are currently not spawning due to dirt, cleaning is a strategic investment in future rewards.
- The global scan shows no nearby apples, so there's no immediate benefit to eating one. Moreover, moving to clean dirt is a low-cost, high-impact action that supports long-term goal achievement.
- There is no indication of other dirt or apple locations closer than (7, 3), so focusing on this one spot is optimal.

Therefore, the best action is to clean the dirt at

--- Step 45 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (9, 7). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 3) to enable future apple spawning.

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 4 units away — a reasonable distance, but currently unreachable due to the river being dirty.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 3), 6 units away — this is not immediately close, but it's the only source of dirt that needs to be cleaned to enable apple spawning.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean. This means that without cleaning dirt, there will be no apples to eat, regardless of how far you walk.
- Eating an apple now (even if it's nearby) would give only +1.0 reward, but it's not a viable option here because there's no apple visible nearby — the nearest is 4 units away, and the path may be blocked by dirt.
- Cleaning dirt has no immediate reward, but it is a necessary precondition for future apple spawning. If we don't clean it, apples won't spawn at all, and the group will be unable to earn points.
- Since the dirt is at (7, 3), and we are at (9, 7), we can move in a straight
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 3}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see dirt at (7, 3) and agent 3 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 3).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (5, 0), which is 4 units away. That would require moving through multiple tiles, and there's no immediate apple nearby (within 1 step) for me to eat right now.
- There is dirt at (7, 3), just one step away — and I'm currently at (7, 2), so I can move to (7, 3) to clean it.
- Cleaning dirt does not give immediate points, but it is essential for enabling apples to spawn in the future. Since apples only appear when the river is clean (i.e., when there's less dirt), cleaning this dirt will increase the chance of apples appearing in the area.
- Agent 3 is currently at (7, 3), which suggests they may be trying to clean or interact with that dirt. If they're already there, it's possible they are attempting to clean it — but if they're not making progress, or if they're not cleaning, then I should act to ensure the dirt is cleaned.
- Since I am at (7, 2), I can move to (7, 3) and clean the dirt,
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 3}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2) and dirt at (7, 3).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 3), and I see agent 2 at (7, 2), with dirt directly at my current position. The nearest apple is at (5, 0), which is 5 units away — a significant distance. The dirt at (7, 3) is immediately adjacent and can be cleaned to enable future apple spawning.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple at (7, 3) — only dirt. The nearest apple is at (5, 0), which is far away and not currently accessible. Eating an apple would require moving to a location where one exists, and there is no apple in immediate vicinity. Therefore, **no immediate apple is available** to eat now. This option is not viable.

2. **Clean the dirt at (7, 3)?**  
   This is a strategic move. Cleaning dirt reduces pollution and increases the chance of apples spawning in the future — especially since apples only spawn when the river is clean. The global scan confirms that apples only appear when the river is clean, meaning cleaning dirt is essential for long-term apple availability.  
   Even though cleaning provides no immediate reward, it is a necessary

--- Step 46 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 7). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

You are currently at (8, 7).  
The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 5 units away — directly to the east.  
The global scan shows **no dirt nearby** — meaning there is no dirt to clean.  

Now, consider the two main options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward (+1.0)**  
   - The apple at (13, 7) is within reach — you can move there step by step (no diagonal movement, so it will take 5 moves).  
   - Eating an apple gives you a direct +1.0 point.  
   - However, apples only spawn *when the river is clean*. Right now, there is no dirt to clean, so apples are not spawning.  
   - This means the apple at (13, 7) may not be a permanent or sustainable resource — it might be a one-time occurrence, or it might be a false positive.  
   - Since no dirt exists in the global scan, there's no current mechanism to enable apple spawning — so the apple may not be available long-term.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning**  
   - But the
  Decision: {'action': 'random_explore', 'args': {}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see agent 3 at (7, 3).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

**Current Position**: (7, 2)  
**Agent 3's Position**: (7, 3) — directly above you, so close proximity.  
**Nearest Apple**: (5, 0) — distance of 4 units (requires moving left 2, down 2).  
**Nearest Dirt**: None found in the global scan.  

Important context:  
- Apples only spawn **on land when the river is clean**.  
- Cleaning dirt gives **no immediate reward**, but is **necessary** to enable future apple spawning.  
- There is **no dirt visible** in the global scan.  
- You cannot move diagonally — so movement is restricted to up/down/left/right.  

### Option 1: Eat an apple for immediate reward  
- The nearest apple is at (5, 0), which is 4 units away.  
- You can reach it via path: (7,2) → (6,2) → (5,2) → (5,1) → (5,0).  
- However, **apples only spawn when the river is clean**.  
  Obs: You are at (2, 0). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 1 at (1, 1).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Here’s the reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only 1 step away — that’s the closest apple in the entire map. Eating it gives a direct +1.0 point, which is a guaranteed, immediate reward with no risk.
- The dirt at (7, 2) is far away (distance 7), and cleaning it would require a long journey. There is no indication that future apples will spawn until the river is clean, and since we’re not currently near any dirt, cleaning it now would not provide any immediate benefit.
- Agent 1 is at (1, 1), which is adjacent to the apple at (1, 0). That means agent 1 is in a position to potentially eat it too — but they are not currently there. If I eat the apple now, I gain a point and prevent someone else from getting it. However, the rules don’t say apples are exclusive, so multiple agents could eat the same apple — but in standard interpretation, apples are one-time spawns. Since the apple is visible and not claimed, it's safe to assume it's available for one agent to consume.

Given that:
- The apple is within reach,
- There
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 1, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 2). You see dirt at (7, 2) and dirt at (8, 2).
  Thinking: I am at (8, 2), and the observation shows that there is dirt at both (7, 2) and (8, 2). The global scan indicates that the nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 4 units away — a reasonable distance, but not immediate. The nearest dirt is at (8, 2), which is at my current position, meaning I'm already standing on dirt.

Now, let's analyze the options:

1. **Should I eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple visible at my current location. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 4 steps away. I would need to move to reach it. Since I am currently on dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), I cannot eat an apple unless there is one already present. Since there is no apple at (8, 2) or nearby, I cannot eat one immediately. So, this option is not viable now.

2. **Should I clean dirt to ensure future apples spawn?**  
   Yes — and this is the most urgent action. Dirt blocks apple spawning. The rule states: *Apples

--- Step 44 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (1, 1). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 2 at (2, 0).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only 1 step away — this is a direct, low-effort, high-reward opportunity (+1.0 point).
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 2), which is 7 units away. Cleaning it would require significant movement and time, and there is no immediate benefit from doing so — especially since no apples are currently spawning (apples only appear when the river is clean, which is a future condition).
- There is an agent (agent 2) at (2, 0), which is adjacent to the apple. While this may indicate potential conflict or competition, there is no indication that agent 2 is actively blocking or threatening. Eating the apple now provides a guaranteed point, whereas cleaning dirt offers no immediate reward and delays future apple spawns.
- The game’s core mechanic rewards immediate action (eating apples) over long-term, uncertain actions (cleaning dirt). Since apples spawn only when the river is clean, and we currently have no apples spawning due to dirt, cleaning is not currently beneficial.
- There is no other nearby apple or dirt to justify exploration.

Therefore, the optimal immediate action is to eat the apple at (1
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 1, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 0). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 1 at (1, 1).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only 1 step away — this is a direct, positive reward (+1.0 point) with no risk.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 2), which is 7 steps away. Cleaning it would require significant movement and time, and there’s no immediate benefit from it — apples don’t spawn until the river is clean, but that’s a long-term outcome.
- There is no indication that cleaning dirt is urgent or that future apple spawns will be critical in the near term. In fact, since apples are already spawning (one at (1,0)), the system is already producing rewards.
- Agent 1 is at (1, 1), which is adjacent to the apple. If I don’t act now, that agent might eat it first. Since I am Agent 2, I must act to maximize my own points — and if I wait, I risk losing the apple to another agent.
- There is no immediate threat or obstacle that prevents me from moving to (1, 0) — it’s adjacent and reachable in one move.

Therefore, the immediate reward of eating the apple is both feasible and optimal. Cleaning dirt
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 1, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 2). You see dirt at (7, 2).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 2).

Here's why:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 4 units away — far enough that it's not immediately accessible without movement. Eating it now would require walking to that location, which takes time and may not be efficient given the current situation.
- The dirt at (7, 2) is only 1 unit away — very close and directly reachable from my current position (8, 2). Cleaning it is a low-effort, high-impact action that directly improves the environment.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean. By removing dirt, I enable future apple spawning — which benefits the group and increases long-term rewards. Since apples are the only source of points, enabling their spawning is essential for sustained progress.
- There is no immediate reward for cleaning dirt, but it’s a necessary precondition for future apple generation. In a cleanup game, such actions are strategic investments in future outcomes.
- I cannot move diagonally, so movement is constrained to cardinal directions. Going from (8,2) to (7,2) is a valid, simple step.

Therefore, cleaning the dirt at (7,2) is the optimal action: it

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (1, 1). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 2 at (2, 0).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only 1 step away — this is a direct, low-effort opportunity for a +1.0 reward.
- There is no immediate benefit to cleaning dirt at (7, 2), which is 7 steps away. Cleaning it would require significant movement and time, and since no apples are currently spawning (as the river is not yet clean), there is no current payoff from that action.
- Agent 2 is at (2, 0), which is adjacent to the apple. If agent 2 eats the apple, they would get the reward, but there’s no indication that they are doing so — and since we are operating under a goal to maximize our own points, acting now gives us a clear, immediate advantage.
- The rule states that apples only spawn when the river is clean — but that is a future condition. Right now, the apple is already present. Therefore, we don’t need to clean dirt to get this apple — we can simply eat it.
- There is no evidence that cleaning dirt will result in any immediate benefit or that the group will benefit more from it than from immediate action.

Therefore, the optimal decision is to eat
  Obs: You are at (6, 3). You see agent 2 at (6, 2).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to determine the best course of action.

I am at (6, 3), and I see Agent 2 at (6, 2). The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 7 units away — a significant distance. The nearest dirt is at (6, 1), which is only 2 units away. That means I can reach the dirt in just one move down to (6, 1), and cleaning it would improve the river's cleanliness, enabling apples to spawn in the future.

Currently, there are no apples visible in my immediate vicinity. The apple at (12, 2) is far away and likely won't spawn unless the river is clean. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, cleaning the dirt at (6, 1) is a prerequisite for future apple generation — and thus a strategic necessity for the group's long-term success.

Eating an apple now would give me +1.0 reward immediately, but since no apples are available nearby and the river is currently dirty, there’s no apple to eat. Therefore, the immediate reward option is not viable.

Cleaning the dirt at (6, 1) is the only action

--- Step 44 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 0). You see dirt at (6, 1).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 1).

Reasoning:

- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Right now, there is dirt at (6, 1), which is directly adjacent to my current position (6, 0). This dirt is blocking apple spawning in that area.
- The nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 7 units away — a significant distance. Eating it now would give +1.0 point, but it's not a near-term or guaranteed reward.
- Cleaning the dirt at (6, 1) will improve the river's cleanliness, enabling future apple spawning on land, especially in the vicinity. Since apples spawn only when the river is clean, removing this dirt is a prerequisite for apples to appear in that region.
- There is no immediate reward for cleaning dirt, but it's a necessary step to enable future apple generation — which directly supports the long-term goal of maximizing points.
- Moving to (6, 1) to clean it is a single, simple action (one step down), and it's the only immediate action that improves the environment for future apple spawning.
- Without cleaning this dirt, the area remains barren and no apples will spawn there, even if

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 2). You see dirt at (6, 1) and agent 3 at (6, 3).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 1).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — quite far. Eating it would give +1.0 immediately, but it requires moving through potentially uncleaned terrain, and there's no guarantee that apples will spawn unless the river is clean.
- The dirt at (6, 1) is only 1 unit away — very close. Cleaning it directly contributes to making the river cleaner, which increases the chance of apple spawning in the future. This is a foundational action that enables long-term rewards.
- The rule explicitly states that apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. This means cleaning dirt is not just a side task — it's a prerequisite for apple generation. Without cleaning, even if we reach far apples, they won't spawn.
- Agent 3 is at (6, 3), which is just one step away from me. They might be acting independently. If we don’t clean the dirt, the river remains dirty, and future apple spawning is blocked — potentially depriving the entire group of rewards. Cleaning dirt supports the group's collective goal.
- There’s no immediate apple nearby to eat, and the

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 3). You see agent 2 at (6, 2).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to make the best decision as Agent 3.

Current position: (6, 3)  
Agent 2 is at (6, 2) — directly below me, so we're in the same column.  
Nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 7 units away — quite far.  
Nearest dirt is at (6, 1), just one step below me — distance = 2.  

Key facts:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed).  
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately.  
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward but enables future apple spawning.  
- Movement is only allowed in cardinal directions (up, down, left, right).  
- I cannot move diagonally.  

**Option 1: Eat an apple immediately?**  
The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 7 steps away. I would need to move to (12, 2) to eat it. That’s a long journey.

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 0). You see dirt at (6, 1).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 1).

Here's the reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 7 units away — far out of reach without first improving the environment.
- The dirt at (6, 1) is the nearest dirt patch, just one step away. Cleaning it will improve the river's cleanliness, which in turn increases the chance of apples spawning in the future.
- Eating an apple now is not possible because no apple is available at (6, 0) or nearby. There's no immediate reward to be gained by eating.
- The game mechanics state that apples only spawn when the river is clean — so cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple spawns. This is a necessary step, not a luxury.
- Since I cannot move diagonally, I can only move up/down/left/right. From (6, 0), I can move to (6, 1) to clean the dirt — a simple, low-cost action with high strategic value.

By cleaning the dirt, I'm enabling future apple spawning, which aligns with the long-term goal of maximizing points. This action supports the group's success and ensures that apples

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 2). You see dirt at (6, 1) and agent 3 at (6, 3).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 1).

Here's the reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible in my immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 steps away — far out of reach for immediate consumption.
- The dirt at (6, 1) is only 1 step away, meaning it's very close and easily accessible.
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — so cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple generation. This directly enables the group to gain apples later.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 reward, but there are no apples nearby, and the apple at (12, 2) is too far to reach without first cleaning the dirt to allow apple spawning in the area.
- Since the dirt is adjacent and the apple spawn condition depends on cleanliness, cleaning it is a necessary step to enable future apple growth — especially since the global scan shows the nearest apple is distant.

Even though cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, it creates a foundation for future apple availability. In a long-term cleanup and reward strategy, this is a high-value action.

Therefore, I should move to (6, 1) to clean the dirt — fulfilling
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 3). You see agent 2 at (6, 2).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 1).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 7 units away — far enough that it's not immediately accessible without movement.
- The nearest dirt is at (6, 1), just one step below me at (6, 3). This is very close and within reach.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apple generation. Without cleaning dirt, no apples will appear, regardless of how far away they are.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0, but it's not possible to access one immediately because the river is currently dirty and apples aren't spawning.
- Since I am already at (6, 3), moving to (6, 2) to reach (6, 1) is only one step down — a simple, low-effort action.
- Cleaning dirt doesn't give immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning, which benefits the entire group. This aligns with the long-term goal of maximizing total points through sustainable apple generation.
Therefore, the optimal action is

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (7, 6) and agent 3 at (7, 6).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

Currently, I am at (7, 5). There is dirt at (7, 6), which is directly adjacent to me, and Agent 3 is located there. The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away — a significant distance. There is no apple in immediate proximity, and I have no apple to eat right now.

Key facts:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but enables future apple spawning.
- I cannot move diagonally — so movement is restricted to up, down, left, right.
- The dirt at (7, 6) is immediately accessible — just one step away.

Now, evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple?**  
   There is no apple at (7, 5) or nearby. The nearest apple is 5 steps away at (2, 5). Eating an apple now would require moving to that location, which is not efficient and would waste time. Also, since apples only spawn when dirt is cleaned, there is no apple available *now* — so this option is not viable.

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 1). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully.

Currently, I am at (7, 1). The nearest apple is at (2, 1), which is 5 units away — that's a significant distance. The nearest dirt is at (7, 6), also 5 units away. 

Key insight: Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning. However, cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward. Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately, which is a direct point gain.

But here's the trade-off:
- If I eat an apple now, I get +1.0 immediately, but I'm not near any apples — I have to walk 5 steps to reach (2,1). That means I’ll be moving away from the dirt, and if I don’t clean it, future apple spawning may be blocked.
- The dirt at (7,6) is directly in line with my current position — I can move to (7,6) in 5 steps and clean it. Cleaning it would help enable future apple spawning, which benefits the group. But I get no immediate reward.

Now, consider the global scan: the nearest apple is at (2,1), which is
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 6}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 6). You see agent 1 at (7, 5), dirt at (7, 6), dirt at (6, 7), dirt at (7, 7) and dirt at (8, 7).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 6), which is currently covered in dirt. There is no apple visible in my immediate vicinity — the nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 units away. The dirt at (7, 6), (6, 7), (7, 7), and (8, 7) blocks access to clean land, which is required for apples to spawn.

Key facts:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning, dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately, but only if an apple is present.
- There are no apples currently visible in the vicinity of my position.
- The dirt at (7, 6) is directly under me — I can clean it to make land available.
- Cleaning dirt provides no immediate reward, but enables future apple spawning, which benefits the group.

Analysis of options:

1. **Eat an apple?**  
   → There is no apple at (7, 6) or nearby. I cannot eat one immediately. This option is not viable.

2. **Clean dirt?**  
   → The dirt at (7, 6) is directly beneath me. Cleaning it would

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see agent 3 at (7, 6).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to determine the best course of action.

Current position: (7, 5)  
Agent 3 is at (7, 6) — directly north, so they're in close proximity.  
Nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away — a significant distance.  
Nearest dirt is at (7, 7), just one step north — very close.  

Key facts:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned).  
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but enables future apple spawning.  
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately.  
- Movement is only allowed in cardinal directions (no diagonals).  

Now, evaluating the options:

1. **Eat an apple immediately?**  
   The nearest apple is at (2,5), 5 steps away. To reach it, I’d have to move left across the grid. However, there’s no indication that apples are currently spawning — and in fact, apples only spawn *after* dirt is cleaned. Since the river is currently dirty (dirt at (7,7)), apples are not spawning. Therefore, the apple at (2,5)
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 7}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 7) to enable future apple spawning.

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — far enough that immediate consumption would require significant movement without any guarantee of immediate reward.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 7), also 5 units away — the same distance as the apple. However, dirt cleaning is not immediately rewarding, but it's essential for enabling apples to spawn in the future.
- The current observation states "you see nothing of interest nearby," which suggests no immediate apple is visible or accessible.
- Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple availability. Without cleaning, the apples at (12, 2) and potentially others will not spawn.
- There is no immediate benefit to eating an apple now — it would give +1.0, but the apple at (12, 2) is not currently spawnable due to the presence of dirt.
- Moving to (7, 7) to clean it is a strategic investment: it will enable future apple spawning, which benefits the group in the long term. Since the
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 7}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 6). You see agent 1 at (7, 5), dirt at (6, 7), dirt at (7, 7) and dirt at (8, 7).
  Thinking: I am Agent 3 at (7, 6). The current observation shows that there is dirt at (6,7), (7,7), and (8,7) — all of which are within a short distance. The nearest dirt is at (7,7), which is only one step away (directly below me). This means I can clean it immediately.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

1. **Eating an apple for immediate reward**:  
   The nearest apple is at (2,5), which is 6 steps away. There is no apple visible in the immediate vicinity (I see no apple at (7,6) or nearby). Eating an apple would require traveling to (2,5), which is far and time-consuming. Moreover, since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), and we currently have dirt nearby, there's no guarantee that apples will spawn in the near future. So, immediate apple consumption is not viable or efficient.

2. **Cleaning dirt to enable future apple spawning**:  
   This is critical. Dirt removal is not rewarded directly, but it enables apples to spawn — which is the ultimate goal. Since apples only appear when the river is clean, and

--- Step 45 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 0). You see agent 3 at (8, 1).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

Current position: (8, 0)  
Agent 3 is at (8, 1) — directly above you, so visibility is good.  
Nearest Apple: at (13, 0), distance = 5 units.  
Nearest Dirt: **None found** in the global scan.

This is critical: **There is no dirt to clean.** That means there's no immediate opportunity to perform a cleaning action that would enable future apple spawning.

Now, evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   - The nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 5 units away.  
   - To reach it, you’d need to move from (8, 0) → (9, 0) → (10, 0) → (11, 0) → (12, 0) → (13, 0).  
   - Movement is allowed only in cardinal directions (up, down, left, right), so this path is valid.  
   - However, **apples only spawn when the river is clean** — and currently, there is **no dirt** to clean.
  Decision: {'action': 'random_explore', 'args': {}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 4). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: Given the current observation and global scan, let's analyze the situation carefully.

You are at (8, 4).  
The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — a significant distance.  
Crucially, the global scan states: **"Nearest Dirt: None found."** This is a critical detail.  

### Step 1: Can you eat an apple now?
- There is no visible apple at your current position.  
- The nearest apple is 6 units away, and you don't have a path or indication that it's accessible immediately.  
- Eating an apple requires being *on* an apple — not just nearby.  
→ **No immediate apple is available to eat.**

### Step 2: Should you clean dirt?
- The scan says "Nearest Dirt: None found."  
→ This means there is currently *no dirt* in the environment.  
→ Therefore, **cleaning dirt is not possible** — there’s nothing to clean.  
→ Cleaning dirt would only matter *if* dirt existed, which it does not.  
→ So, **no benefit to cleaning dirt now** — it would be a wasted action.

### Step 3: Where should you explore
  Decision: {'action': 'random_explore', 'args': {}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Moving from (8, 1) towards (12, 2).
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 1). You see agent 1 at (8, 0).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

Current position: (8, 1)  
Agent 1 is at (8, 0) — directly below you.  
Nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away (distance = |12–8| + |2–1| = 4 + 1 = 5).  
Global scan says: **No dirt is found nearby** — this is critical.

Rule reminder:  
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean.  
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but enables future apple spawning.  
- You can only move orthogonally (up, down, left, right).  
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.  

Now, evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple immediately?**  
   - The nearest apple is at (12, 2), 5 steps away.  
   - There is **no dirt to clean**, so cleaning is not possible.  
   - Therefore, no future apple spawning is blocked — the river is already clean (or no dirt exists).  
   - However, the apple is still far away.  
   - Eating an apple now would require movement

Moving from (8, 0) towards (13, 0).
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 0). You see agent 3 at (9, 1).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

**Current Position:** (8, 0)  
**Agent 3 Location:** (9, 1) — not directly threatening, but nearby.  
**Nearest Apple:** (13, 0), distance = 5 units.  
**Nearest Dirt:** None found in the global scan.  

This is critical: **There is no dirt to clean.** That means:

- Cleaning dirt is **not possible** right now — it's not in the environment.
- Therefore, **option 2 (cleaning dirt for future apples)** is **not actionable** at this moment.
- The rule says apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — but if there's no dirt, there's nothing to clean, so no apples can spawn *via this mechanism*.

So, we must ask: **Is there any apple available now, or is it too far?**

The nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 5 units away. Since movement is only allowed in cardinal directions (up, down, left, right), and no diagonal movement is allowed, we must walk from (8,0) → (9,0) → (10,0) → (
  Decision: {'action': 'move_to', 'args': {'coord_x': 13, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Moving from (8, 5) towards (13, 6).
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 5). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: Given the current situation, let's carefully analyze the trade-offs:

- **Current Observation**: You are at (8, 5), and you see nothing of interest nearby.  
- **Global Scan**: The nearest apple is at (13, 6), which is 6 units away. There is **no dirt** listed in the global scan — meaning there is no dirt to clean.  
- **Apple spawn condition**: Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed). Since there is currently **no dirt**, apples are not spawning — even though an apple is located at (13, 6), it may not be available to eat unless the river is clean.

But here's the key point: **Apples only spawn when the river is clean**. If there's no dirt to begin with, then the river is already clean — so apples should already be spawning. However, the global scan says "nearest apple is at (13,6)", which implies that the apple is present and accessible. So either:
- The apple is already available, or
- The river is clean, and apples are already spawning.

But there's no dirt listed — so cleaning dirt is not needed *now*.
  Decision: {'action': 'move_to', 'args': {'coord_x': 13, 'coord_y': 6}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (9, 1). You see agent 1 at (8, 0).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

You are currently at (9, 1).  
You see Agent 1 at (8, 0).  
The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is a distance of 4 steps away.  
The global scan says: **No dirt is found nearby**.

This is critical. The rules state that **apples only spawn on land when the river is clean** — meaning, dirt must be cleaned *before* apples can appear. Since there is **no dirt** in the global scan, there is no immediate dirt to clean. Therefore, **cleaning dirt is not currently a viable action** — there's nothing to clean.

Now, evaluating the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   The apple at (12, 2) is 4 steps away. You can reach it, but you must first move there. Eating an apple gives +1.0 point — immediate and valuable. However, since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and there is currently no dirt to clean, **apples are not currently spawning**. So, the apple at (12, 2) might not exist — or might be a false positive in

--- Step 47 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (9, 0). You see agent 3 at (8, 1).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

**Current Position**: (9, 0)  
**Agent 3's Position**: (8, 1) — very close, possibly a teammate or competitor.  
**Nearest Apple**: (13, 0), distance = 4 units.  
**Nearest Dirt**: None found in the global scan.  

This is critical: **There is no dirt in the global scan.** That means there is currently no dirt to clean. Cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apples to spawn — apples only appear when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt has been removed).  

So, the trade-off question must be re-evaluated:

1. **Eat an apple now?**  
   - The nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 4 steps away.  
   - To reach it, you’d need to move right from (9,0) to (13,0) — a straightforward path.  
Moving from (12, 5) towards (6, 2).
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (12, 5). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 2) to enable future apple spawning.

Reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 7), which is only 2 units away — so it's within reach. However, the apple will only spawn *if* the river is clean. The global scan shows the nearest dirt is at (6, 2), which is 9 units away. This means the river is currently dirty, and thus apples are not spawning.
- Eating an apple now would give a +1.0 immediate reward, but if the river remains dirty, apples will not spawn in the future. This would deprive the group of future opportunities to earn points.
- Cleaning dirt is not immediately rewarding, but it's a prerequisite for apple spawning. Without cleaning, no apples will appear, regardless of how close they seem.
- Since the dirt is far away (9 units), moving there now will take time and effort. However, the long-term benefit — enabling future apple spawns — outweighs the short-term gain of eating one apple now.
- There is no immediate interest nearby (nothing visible at (12, 5)), so exploring further is not urgent.

Therefore, the optimal strategy is to move toward the dirt at

--- Step 46 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 0). You see dirt at (7, 0).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 0), where there is dirt, and the nearest apple is at (11, 0), 4 units away. Right now, there are no apples visible in the immediate vicinity — the only apple is at a distance. The dirt at (7, 0) must be cleaned to enable apples to spawn, since apples only appear on land when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt).

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple at (7, 0). The nearest apple is 4 units away. To reach it, I would need to move east along the x-axis (since I can't move diagonally), which would require first cleaning the dirt at (7, 0) to make the land usable. But even then, I can't eat an apple unless it's present. Since no apple is currently spawning (because the river is dirty), I cannot eat one now. So, immediate reward is not available.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   Yes. The dirt at (7, 0) is the only dirt in the global scan. Cleaning it will make that location usable land.
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 5). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision.

Currently, I am at (2, 5). The nearest apple is at (1, 8), which is 4 units away — that's a reasonable distance. However, apples only spawn when the river is clean, meaning that cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apple availability. Right now, the nearest dirt is at (6, 2), which is 7 units away — not immediately close.

The key trade-off is:
- **Eating an apple now** gives +1.0 point immediately, but only if an apple is present and accessible.
- **Cleaning dirt** has no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning, which benefits the group long-term.

But here's the critical point: **apples only spawn when the river is clean**. This implies that if the dirt is not cleaned, apples won’t appear — even if they are nearby. Since the nearest apple is at (1,8), and the river is currently dirty (due to dirt at (6,2)), that apple will not spawn unless the dirt is cleaned.

Therefore, **eating an apple now is not possible**, because apples aren’t spawning due to the dirty river. The apple at (1

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (11, 5). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the trade-off between immediate reward and long-term benefits.

Currently, I'm at (11, 5). The nearest apple is at (12, 7), which is only 3 steps away — very accessible. Eating it would give me +1.0 point immediately. However, the nearest dirt is at (6, 2), which is 8 steps away — quite distant. Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable future apple spawning, but it requires significant movement and time with no immediate reward.

Key considerations:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean. So, if I don't clean dirt, apples will not appear — even if I walk near them.
- The apple at (12, 7) is currently spawnable only if the river is clean. But since we don't have a direct observation of the river's condition, and dirt is far away, it's possible the river is currently dirty and thus no apples are spawning — meaning the apple at (12, 7) might not be available at all.
- The global scan shows the apple is at (12, 7), but if the river is dirty, apples don't spawn — so the apple may not exist in reality,

--- Step 47 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 0). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: The current situation requires a strategic trade-off between immediate reward and long-term sustainability.

Let’s analyze each option:

1. **Eat an apple at (11, 0)**  
   - Distance: 4 steps (from (7,0) to (11,0)) — feasible.  
   - Immediate reward: +1.0 point.  
   - However, apples only spawn *when the river is clean*. The presence of an apple now does not guarantee future spawns — it might be a one-time occurrence.  
   - Eating it now gives a short-term gain but doesn't contribute to the long-term goal of enabling more apples through clean river conditions.

2. **Clean dirt at (6,2)**  
   - Distance: 3 steps (from (7,0) to (6,2)) — also feasible.  
   - No immediate reward, but cleaning dirt improves the river’s cleanliness, which increases the likelihood of future apple spawns.  
   - This action supports the group’s sustainability — more apples will appear later, which benefits both individual and collective goals.  
   - Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, cleaning dirt is a *prerequisite* for future apple generation.  
   - Even if no apple
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 2}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (3, 5). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to analyze the trade-off carefully.

Currently, I am at (3, 5). The nearest apple is at (3, 1), which is 4 units away — directly upward along the same column. That’s a short, straightforward path. Eating an apple would give me +1.0 immediately, which is a clear reward.

However, the nearest dirt is at (6, 2), 6 units away — which is farther than the apple. Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apples to spawn in the future, but it provides no immediate reward. The key point is that apples only spawn *when the river is clean*, meaning dirt must be cleaned to allow apple generation. So cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple availability — but only after the dirt is cleaned.

Right now, there is an apple within reach — just 4 steps away. There is no indication that the river is currently dirty or that apple spawning is disabled. Since apples already exist at (3, 1), and they are within range, we can assume the river is already clean enough to spawn apples. Therefore, the need to clean dirt is not urgent — it's a future condition, not a current one.

Moreover, the apple at (3,1) is
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 3, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (10, 5). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the trade-off between immediate reward and long-term benefit.

Currently, I am at (10, 5). The nearest apple is at (12, 7), which is a distance of 4 squares away. That means I can reach it in 4 moves (moving right then up). Eating that apple would give me +1.0 point immediately.

However, the nearest dirt is at (6, 2), which is 7 squares away. Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning — meaning, without cleaning dirt, apples won’t spawn at all. Since apples only appear when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple generation.

But here's the key: I currently see **nothing of interest nearby** — meaning no visible apples or dirt in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is 4 units away, and the nearest dirt is 7 units away. 

Now, consider the implications:

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 7). You see dirt at (6, 7), dirt at (7, 7), dirt at (8, 7) and dirt at (6, 8).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 7), and my current observation shows that there is dirt at (6,7), (7,7), (8,7), and (6,8). The global scan indicates that the nearest apple is at (13,7), which is 6 units away. The nearest dirt is at (7,7) — meaning I am standing on dirt.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Should I eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There is no apple visible at my current location. The nearest apple is at (13,7), which is far away. Eating an apple requires being on land where one exists. Since there are no apples currently visible at (7,7) or nearby, I cannot eat one right now. So, this option is not viable.

2. **Should I clean dirt to ensure future apples spawn?**  
   → Yes. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when there is no dirt). Currently, I am standing on dirt at (7,7), and there is dirt at adjacent cells. Cleaning dirt removes it, allowing land to form. Once land is formed, apples can spawn. Since the nearest apple is

--- Step 47 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 1). You see an apple at (1, 0).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Reasoning:

- The apple is at (1, 0), which is only 2 steps away — a very short distance. Since I can move only in cardinal directions (up, down, left, right), reaching it requires just two moves: from (2,1) to (1,1) to (1,0). This is a simple, efficient action.
- Eating an apple gives me +1.0 point immediately, which is a direct and tangible reward with no risk or cost.
- The nearest dirt is at (6,7), which is 10 units away — far beyond any immediate benefit. Cleaning dirt would require significant effort and time, and there is no indication that apples will spawn in the near future or that the group will benefit from such a long-term action.
- There is no immediate future apple spawn threat or opportunity tied to dirt cleaning — the apple at (1,0) is already visible and within reach.
- In a cleanup game where immediate rewards are available and future rewards depend on conditions (like clean rivers), prioritizing immediate gains is rational when the future benefit is uncertain and far off.

Therefore, the optimal action is to eat the apple at (1
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 1, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 4). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to analyze the trade-off carefully based on the current situation and long-term goals.

Currently, I am at (7, 4). The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 units away — quite far. The nearest dirt is at (6, 7), which is only 4 units away. That means I can reach the dirt before I can reach the apple. 

Key insight: Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apple spawning. So, if I don't clean dirt, apples won't appear, even if I walk far. This makes cleaning dirt a foundational step for future apple availability.

Right now, there are no apples visible nearby — the nearest is 6 steps away. If I go to eat that apple immediately, I get +1 point, but I’m not gaining access to future apple spawns. In contrast, cleaning the dirt at (6,7) will enable apples to spawn in the future, potentially allowing more apples to appear in areas where they weren’t possible before.

Moreover, since I can reach the dirt in 4 steps (from (7,4) to (6,7)), and the apple is 6 steps away, cleaning dirt is
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 7}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 7). You see dirt at (6, 7), dirt at (8, 7) and dirt at (6, 8).
  Thinking: Given the current situation, let's analyze the trade-off carefully.

**Current Position:** (7, 7)  
**Visible Dirt:** (6, 7), (8, 7), (6, 8)  
**Nearest Apple:** (13, 7) — distance 6  
**Nearest Dirt:** (6, 7) — distance 1  

### Option 1: Eat an Apple for Immediate Reward  
- The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 6 units away.  
- There are no apples visible or immediately accessible at (7, 7).  
- Eating an apple would give +1.0 point, but it requires movement to reach it.  
- However, **no apple is currently spawnable** because the river is not clean (dirt exists).  
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — i.e., when dirt is removed.  
→ **Conclusion:** You cannot eat an apple *now* because there are no apples available. Eating one would require reaching a location where apples are already present, which is not the case. So, this option is **not viable** at this moment.

### Option 2: Clean Dirt to Enable Future Apple

--- Step 48 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (1, 1). You see an apple at (1, 0).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available at distance 1 — this is the closest apple to me, and I can reach it in one move.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately, which directly increases my score.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 1), which is 6 units away — cleaning it would require a long journey and no immediate reward. Since there's no indication that dirt cleaning will result in apples spawning before I reach it, and since apples are already present nearby, there's no urgent need to clean dirt right now.
- There is no immediate benefit to cleaning dirt over eating the apple. The dirt cleaning is a long-term, indirect action that only enables future apple spawning — but we already have an apple in range.
- The rules state that apples spawn *only* when the river is clean, but that doesn't mean the river is dirty now — the global scan shows a nearby apple, which implies that apple spawning is already active (or at least possible). Therefore, the current apple is a valid, immediate opportunity.

Therefore, the best action is to eat the apple at (1, 0) to gain immediate points, and then plan future
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 1, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 4). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to determine the best course of action.

I am currently at (6, 4). The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away — a significant distance. The nearest dirt is at (6, 7), only 3 units away. This is important because apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt has been removed). So, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple spawning.

Right now, there are no visible apples nearby — I see nothing of interest — which suggests that without cleaning dirt, apples will not appear at all, even if I move toward them. The apple at (2, 5) is currently not spawning because the river (presumably) is dirty.

So, the trade-off:
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 point immediately, but there is no apple in immediate range. I cannot eat one without moving and finding one first.
- Cleaning dirt at (6, 7) would not give immediate reward, but it's essential to enable future apple spawning. Since apples only appear when the river is clean, cleaning this dirt is a prerequisite for the apple at (2, 5) to become accessible.

Given
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 7}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 7). You see dirt at (6, 7), dirt at (8, 7), dirt at (6, 8) and dirt at (7, 8).
  Thinking: I am at (6, 7), and the current observation shows dirt at (6, 7), (8, 7), (6, 8), and (7, 8). The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 steps away — far from my current position. There is no apple in immediate proximity, and the only available apple is at a distance that requires significant movement.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There is no apple visible at my current position. The nearest apple is 6 steps away, and I have no information that any apple is spawning nearby. Eating an apple would require movement to reach it, and since apples only spawn *when the river is clean* (i.e., when dirt is removed), and currently there is dirt present, no apples are available. Thus, **I cannot eat an apple right now**. Attempting to move toward (2, 5) without cleaning dirt would be futile — no apples will spawn until the dirt is removed.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
1. **Eating an apple now**: The nearest apple is 5 units away — I would need to walk there, and it would give +1.
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 7}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (3, 0). You see an apple at (1, 0) and an apple at (2, 1).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Here's the reasoning:

- The apple at (1, 0) is only 2 steps away — a very short distance. This gives me immediate +1.0 point, which is a direct and valuable reward.
- The dirt at (6, 7) is far away (distance 10), and cleaning it would require significant movement and time. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, cleaning dirt is necessary for future apple spawning, but it doesn't yield any immediate benefit.
- There is no nearby dirt (within reasonable reach) that I need to clean to enable apple spawning now. The current apples are already present, and they can be eaten immediately.
- The apple at (2, 1) is farther away (distance 3 from current position), so it's less accessible and less immediately rewarding.
- In a cleanup game, while long-term environmental improvement (cleaning dirt) is important, the primary goal is to maximize points. Immediate rewards from apples should be prioritized unless there's a clear, urgent need to clean dirt that would otherwise prevent apple spawning.

Therefore, eating the apple at (1, 0) provides immediate value with minimal cost. Cleaning dirt is
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 1, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 6). You see agent 1 at (7, 5), dirt at (6, 7), dirt at (7, 7) and dirt at (8, 7).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 7) — not because it's the only dirt, but because it's the closest and most strategically important.

Here’s my reasoning:

1. **Eating an apple now?**  
   The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 units away. To reach it, I’d need to move through multiple zones, possibly passing through more dirt. There are no apples visible near me — the only apple is far away. Eating one now would give +1.0, but I’d have to walk a long distance to get there, and there’s no guarantee that any apple would spawn in the near future without first cleaning dirt. So, immediate reward is low value given the distance and lack of nearby apples.

2. **Cleaning dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   Dirt removal is not rewarding immediately, but it’s essential — apples only spawn when the river is clean. The dirt at (7, 7) is just one step away (distance 1), meaning I can reach it in one move. Cleaning it will reduce the dirt load in that area, potentially allowing apples to spawn nearby in the future. Since the global scan shows the nearest dirt is at (7,

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 6). You see dirt at (6, 7), dirt at (7, 7), agent 3 at (7, 7) and dirt at (8, 7).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to make the best decision for maximizing points and contributing to the group's success.

Current position: (7, 6)  
Immediate surroundings:
- Dirt at (6, 7)
- Dirt at (7, 7) — occupied by Agent 3
- Dirt at (8, 7)

Global scan:
- Nearest apple: (2, 5), distance 6 — far away
- Nearest dirt: (7, 7), distance 1 — very close

Key observations:
- There are no apples currently visible in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is 6 steps away, which is quite distant.
- The dirt at (7,7) is directly adjacent and is the closest dirt (distance 1). This dirt is currently blocking potential apple spawning — apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed).
- Agent 3 is already at (7,7), which suggests they may be trying to clean or are blocked by the dirt. But since they're at the dirt, they can't clean it unless they move or we assist.

Trade-off analysis:

1. **Eat an apple?**  
   → No apples are visible nearby. The nearest
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 7}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 0). You see an apple at (1, 0) and an apple at (2, 1).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Here’s the reasoning:

- The apple at (1, 0) is directly adjacent and only one step away — this gives me an immediate +1.0 reward with no risk or cost.
- The nearest dirt is at (6, 7), which is 11 steps away. Cleaning it would require a significant journey and no immediate benefit — especially since apples only spawn *when the river is clean*, which means the dirt must be cleaned *before* apples can appear. Since there are already apples present (at (1,0) and (2,1)), the river is already clean enough for spawning to occur — so cleaning distant dirt is not urgent or necessary right now.
- There is no indication that the dirt at (6,7) is blocking anything or that future apple spawns are dependent on immediate cleanup. Apple spawning is tied to overall river cleanliness, not localized dirt patches.
- Eating an apple now provides immediate value, increases my score, and does not hinder any long-term goals — it’s a safe, efficient action.

Therefore, the trade-off favors immediate reward over future potential. I have no reason to delay eating the apple at (1,0). I will eat it now
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 1, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 7). You see agent 1 at (7, 6), dirt at (6, 7), dirt at (7, 7), dirt at (8, 7) and dirt at (6, 8).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 7), and the current observation shows that there is dirt at (6, 7), (7, 7), (8, 7), and (6, 8). The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 6 steps away. The global scan confirms that the nearest dirt is at (7, 7) — directly where I am — meaning I'm standing on dirt.

Let’s break down the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple visible at my current location. The nearest apple is 6 steps away, and there is no indication that any apple is spawning nearby due to clean land. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), and currently the area is full of dirt, there are no apples available to eat. So, **eating an apple is not possible now** — it would require movement and a clean spot, which doesn't exist yet.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   This is a critical point. The rule states: *Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (less dirt = more apples)*. Currently, I

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 6). You see dirt at (6, 7), agent 3 at (7, 7) and dirt at (8, 7).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

Currently, I am at (7, 6). The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 units away — quite far. There is dirt at (6, 7), which is only 1 unit away (distance = 1), and agent 3 is at (7, 7). There's also dirt at (8, 7), which is 1 unit away from me (distance = 1). 

Key facts:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but enables future apple spawns.
- I can only move in cardinal directions (up, down, left, right) — no diagonals.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.

Right now, there is dirt very close to me — at (6, 7) and (8, 7). These are both just one step away. Cleaning either of these would contribute directly to cleaning the river and potentially allow apples to spawn in the future.

  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 1, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 0). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 1 at (1, 1).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only 1 step away — this is a direct, positive reward (+1.0 point) with no risk.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 2), which is 7 steps away — this is far off, and cleaning it would take significant time and effort without any immediate benefit.
- There is no indication that the dirt cleaning will spawn apples in a way that justifies the delay, especially since apples only spawn when the river is clean — but the river’s state is not visible or measurable in this observation.
- Agent 1 is at (1, 1), which is adjacent to the apple — they may already be trying to claim it or are in a position to benefit from it. Eating the apple now gives me a point before they do, and it doesn't harm the group directly.
- There is no evidence that cleaning dirt is a necessary or urgent step for the group’s survival or progress — it's a long-term strategy with no immediate payoff.

Therefore, the immediate reward of eating the apple is optimal. Delaying it to clean dirt would be a poor trade-off given the lack of urgency, distance, and visibility of future
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 1, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see dirt at (7, 2).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 2), and I see dirt at that exact location. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), 5 units away — that’s a significant distance. Right now, there is no apple available for immediate consumption, and the only dirt is right where I am.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple** – There is no apple at (7, 2), and the nearest apple is 5 steps away. Since I cannot eat anything immediately, this option is not viable right now. Eating would require movement and finding an apple first — which is not possible unless I move.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning** – This is the only actionable step available. Dirt at (7, 2) is directly under me. Cleaning it would reduce the dirt count in the environment, which improves the river's cleanliness. According to the rules, apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning cleaning dirt is essential for future apple generation. Even though there’s no immediate reward, this action is critical for long-term progress. Since the nearest apple is 5 units away, and the river is currently dirty at (7, 2), cleaning this dirt is a necessary prerequisite to allow apples

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (1, 1). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 2 at (2, 0).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only 1 step away — this is a direct, positive action with a clear +1.0 reward.
- The nearest dirt is at (6, 5), which is 9 steps away. Cleaning it would provide long-term benefits (more apples in the future), but there is no immediate reward or urgency in doing so.
- Agent 2 is at (2, 0), which is adjacent to the apple. If agent 2 is also trying to eat the apple, there may be a conflict — but since the apple is at (1, 0) and we are at (1, 1), we can reach it before agent 2 (who is at (2, 0) and would need to move to (1, 0) to get it). However, even if agent 2 reaches it first, we still have the option to eat it if we act now.
- Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt is not immediate, the long-term benefit of cleaning is not worth the delay when a tangible, immediate reward is available.
- There is no indication that cleaning dirt is urgent or that
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 1, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 0). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 1 at (1, 1).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Here's the reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available at (1, 0), just one step away. Since the goal is to maximize points and apples give +1.0 each, taking this immediate reward is optimal in the current state.
- The nearest dirt is at (6, 5), which is 9 units away — far beyond the current reach. Cleaning it would require a significant journey with no immediate benefit, and there’s no indication that apples will spawn until the river is clean. Since we are not yet in a position to clean dirt, and there's no urgent need to do so (given that apples are already present), delaying action for future benefits is not justified.
- Agent 1 is at (1, 1), which is adjacent to the apple. If agent 1 is also trying to eat the apple, there may be a conflict. However, since the apple is at (1, 0), and agent 1 is at (1, 1), they are on the same column but separated by one cell. If agent 1 moves down to (1, 0), they could claim the apple. But since we are at (2, 0),

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 2). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 5), even though it doesn't give immediate reward.

Reasoning:
- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 5 units away — a significant distance. There's no immediate apple available at my current position (7, 2).
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 5), just 3 units away — very close and directly in my line of sight vertically.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean, meaning dirt removal is a prerequisite for apple generation. Without cleaning dirt, no apples will appear, regardless of how far they are.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 reward, but if the river remains dirty, future apples won't spawn — effectively wasting the opportunity to gain more apples later.
- Since the dirt is only 3 units away, it's a short, efficient path to clean it. This action enables future apple spawning, which is critical for long-term point accumulation and group success.
- There's no immediate nearby apple or interesting object to exploit. The current observation says "you see nothing of interest," which reinforces that exploration is not justified without a clear path to value.

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (1, 1). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 2 at (2, 0).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only 1 step away — this gives me a direct +1.0 point with no risk or cost.
- There is no visible dirt nearby (the nearest dirt is at (6, 5), 9 steps away), so cleaning it now would not lead to apple spawning in the near term. The benefit of future apples is speculative and delayed.
- There is an agent (Agent 2) at (2, 0), which is adjacent to the apple. If I don't act now, that agent might eat it before me — meaning I lose the immediate reward.
- Since I cannot move diagonally, the path to the apple is straightforward: move from (1,1) to (1,0). No risk, no cost, and maximum immediate benefit.
- Cleaning dirt is a long-term strategy that only pays off when apples spawn — which depends on the river being clean. But with no current dirt nearby and no indication that the river is dirty or that apple spawning is imminent, this action is not urgent.

Therefore, the optimal decision is to eat the apple immediately to maximize my current score. Future cleaning can be considered after I’ve secured

  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see agent 2 at (7, 2).
  Thinking: The current observation shows that I am at (7, 3), and Agent 2 is at (7, 2) — directly above me. The global scan indicates that the nearest apple is at (5, 0), which is 5 units away (a significant distance), and critically, **there is no dirt visible in the global scan**.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   - The nearest apple is at (5, 0), which is 5 units away. Since I can’t move diagonally, I’d need to move at least 5 steps to reach it (e.g., left 2, down 3).  
   - However, apples only spawn *when the river is clean*. The current global scan says "no dirt found," which implies the river is currently clean — so apples *can* spawn.  
   - But if there's no dirt to clean, and no dirt is visible, then cleaning isn't possible. Therefore, there's no benefit to cleaning dirt *now*.  
   - Eating an apple would give +1.0 point, but only if it’s accessible. Since it’s far away and we don’t know if it’s currently spawn

--- Step 47 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 6). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

You are currently at (8, 6).  
The nearest apple is at (3, 6), which is 5 units away — a significant distance.  
However, the global scan indicates: **No dirt is found nearby**. This is critical.

Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning, dirt must be cleaned *first* to enable apple spawning.  
Currently, there is **no dirt** in the global scan. That suggests either:
- The dirt is far away (beyond current visibility), or
- The river is already clean, and apples can spawn naturally.

But here's the key point: **Apples only spawn when the river is clean**. If there's no dirt, the river is clean — so apples *can* spawn. However, the presence of an apple at (3,6) suggests that apples *are* currently spawning — which is consistent with a clean river.

Now, the trade-off:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward (+1.0)**:  
   This gives you a direct point. However, if apples are already spawning due to a clean river, then eating one now doesn't help the group — it's just a personal
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 3, 'coord_y': 6}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 2). You see agent 3 at (6, 3).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

You are at (8, 2).  
Agent 3 is at (6, 3).  
The nearest apple is at (5, 0), which is 5 units away — a significant distance.  
The global scan says "Nearest Dirt: None found." That’s critical.

This means:
- There is currently **no dirt** to clean.  
- Therefore, **no apples can spawn**, regardless of actions taken.  
- The condition for apple spawning (river clean) is not met — it requires dirt to be present first, which is currently absent.

So, the trade-off options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There is **no apple visible** at your current location or nearby. The nearest apple is at (5, 0), 5 units away.  
   → You cannot eat an apple unless you move to it and it's available. But apples only spawn when dirt is present. Since no dirt exists, **no apples are currently spawning**.  
   → Thus, **eating an apple is not possible now** — it would be a false option.

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 3). You see agent 2 at (8, 2).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

You are currently at (6, 3). Agent 2 is at (8, 2), which is to the southeast — a direction that may be relevant if coordination or movement constraints are involved, but no explicit rules about interaction with other agents are given.

### Key Observations:

- **Nearest Apple**: at (5, 0), distance = 4.  
  This is a significant distance — you would need to move at least 4 steps to reach it.  
  Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately, which is a direct reward.

- **Nearest Dirt**: "None found" in the global scan.  
  This is critical. According to the rules:  
  > Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (less dirt = more apples).  
  Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward but is necessary to enable apple spawning.  

  So, if there is **no dirt** to clean, then **no cleaning is possible**, and thus **no apples can spawn** in the future.  
  This contradicts the global scan saying "Nearest Dirt: None found" — if there is no dirt, then there is nothing to clean, and the condition for apple

Moving from (7, 6) towards (3, 6).
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 6). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

You are at (7, 6).  
The nearest apple is at (3, 6) — exactly 4 units west. That’s a clear path along the same row (y=6), which means you can move directly to it without obstacles (assuming no terrain blocks).  

However, the global scan says: **"Nearest Dirt: None found."** This is critical. Dirt must be cleaned to allow apples to spawn. Since there is no dirt currently in the environment, cleaning isn't needed — there's nothing to clean.  

Therefore, **option 2 (cleaning dirt)** is not applicable — there's no dirt to clean, and thus no benefit to doing so. Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward and only enables future apple spawning, but if no dirt exists, apples are not dependent on cleaning anything.  

Option 1: **Eat an apple** — the nearest apple is at (3,6), which is reachable in 4 steps (moving west). Since apples give +1.0 each, and there's no immediate cost to eating it, and no dirt to clean, this action provides a direct, immediate reward.  

Option 3: Explore elsewhere? There’s no indication of hidden
  Decision: {'action': 'move_to', 'args': {'coord_x': 3, 'coord_y': 6}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 3). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

You are currently at (8, 3). The global scan shows:

- The nearest apple is at (5, 0), which is 6 units away — a significant distance.
- There is **no dirt** in the global scan — meaning there is currently no dirt to clean.

This is critical: **apples only spawn on land when the river is clean**. Since there is no dirt visible, there is no dirt to clean, and therefore **no immediate spawning of apples**. So, even if you move toward the apple at (5, 0), you won't be able to eat it unless the land becomes clean first.

But here’s the key point: **you cannot spawn apples without cleaning dirt**. Since there is no dirt in the current scan, that implies either:
- Dirt is not yet visible (perhaps it's off-grid or hidden),
- Or the river is currently clean, and apples are not spawning because there's no dirt to clean (which contradicts the rule — apples spawn *when* the river is clean, meaning dirt must be cleaned to achieve that state).

Wait — let’s re-express the rule:  
> "Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean
  Decision: {'action': 'random_explore', 'args': {}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (5, 3). You see an apple at (3, 2).
  Thinking: I am at (5, 3) and see an apple at (3, 2). Let's analyze the situation carefully.

First, the immediate reward: there is an apple at (3, 2), which is a distance of |5–3| + |3–2| = 2 + 1 = 3 steps away. Eating it would give me +1.0 point immediately.

Second, the global scan says: "Nearest Apple: at (5, 0), distance 3" — this suggests that apples are not currently spawning because there's no dirt to clean. The message also says: "Nearest Dirt: None found." This is critical. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning that dirt must be cleaned first to enable apple spawning. Since no dirt is visible, there’s currently no mechanism to spawn apples. Therefore, **cleaning dirt is not currently possible** — and without dirt, there’s no apple generation.

So, the trade-off:
- Option 1: Eat the apple at (3, 2) → gives immediate +1.0, but only if I can reach it.
- There is no nearby apple that can be eaten now, and the current state of the environment (dirty river) prevents

--- Step 46 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 0). You see dirt at (6, 1).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 1).

Here’s the reasoning:

- There are **no apples currently visible** in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 7 units away — far beyond immediate reach.
- The dirt at (6, 1) is the nearest dirt patch, just one step away. Cleaning it will improve the river's cleanliness and allow apples to spawn in the future.
- Apples **only spawn when the river is clean**, meaning cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for gaining apples. Without cleaning, no apples will appear, even if we walk far.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 point, but there are **no apples available** at the current location or nearby. Therefore, attempting to eat an apple would result in zero reward.
- Moving to clean the dirt at (6, 1) is a **strategic investment** — it enables future apple spawning, which is essential for long-term point accumulation.
- Since we cannot move diagonally, the path to (6,1) is straightforward: move up to (6,1) and clean it.

Thus, the optimal action is to **clean the dirt at (6,1)**. This
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 2). You see dirt at (6, 1) and agent 3 at (6, 3).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 1).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — far enough that immediate consumption would not be efficient.
- The dirt at (6, 1) is only 1 unit away, meaning it's very close and easily accessible.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple generation.
- Eating an apple now gives +1.0 point immediately, but only if an apple is present. There is no visible apple at (6, 2) or nearby; the nearest is far away.
- There is no apple currently spawning because the river is dirty. Cleaning the dirt at (6, 1) will improve the environment and enable future apple spawning — which benefits the group in the long term.
- Since I cannot move diagonally, moving to (6, 1) is a simple, low-cost action that directly contributes to enabling apple growth.
- Even though cleaning gives no immediate reward, it is a necessary step to unlock future rewards. In a cooperative cleanup game, this action supports the group’s overall success.

Therefore, the optimal strategy is to clean the dirt at (

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 3). You see agent 2 at (6, 2).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully and make a strategic decision based on the current state and long-term goals.

Current position: (6, 3)  
Agent 2 is at (6, 2) — directly below me, so we're in the same column.  
Nearest apple is at (12, 2), 7 units away — quite far.  
Nearest dirt is at (6, 1), only 1 unit down — very close.  

Key insight: Apples only spawn when the river is clean. Dirt removal is not immediately rewarding, but it enables future apple spawning. Since apples are the only source of points (+1.0 each), and we're at (6,3), the immediate reward from eating an apple is only available if one is present in our vicinity.

But — there are **no apples visible in the immediate vicinity**. The nearest apple is at (12,2), which is 7 steps away. That means, unless we clean dirt to eventually allow apple spawning, we may not get any apples at all.

Now, dirt is at (6,1), just one step below me. I can move down to (6,1) and clean it — this would make the river

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 0). You see dirt at (6, 1).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 1).

Here's the reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible in the immediate vicinity (the nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 7 units away — far out of reach without clearing path or improving conditions).
- The only dirt visible is at (6, 1), just one step away. This is the closest dirt to my current position.
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning. Since apples are not currently spawning, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple generation.
- Eating an apple now is not possible because no apple is within reach (and there's no apple at (6, 0) or nearby).
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it is essential for enabling future apple spawns, which directly supports the group's goal of maximizing points.
- Moving to (6, 1) to clean it is a minimal cost action with high long-term value — it's a single step, and once cleaned, the area becomes suitable for apple spawning, potentially leading to apples appearing nearby or on the path to (13, 0).

Therefore, the optimal action is to clean the dirt at
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 2). You see dirt at (6, 1) and agent 3 at (6, 3).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 1).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — quite far. Eating it would give a +1.0 reward, but it would require a long path, and there's no immediate indication that apples will spawn at that location unless the river is clean.
- The dirt at (6, 1) is only 1 unit away — very close. Cleaning it would directly improve the river's cleanliness, which increases the chance of apples spawning in the future. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, this is a prerequisite for long-term apple harvesting.
- Agent 3 is at (6, 3), which is just one step away from the dirt. They might be trying to clean or collect, but their position doesn't suggest they're actively working on the river. If I clean the dirt now, I’m making progress toward enabling future apple spawns, which benefits the group.
- There is no immediate reward in cleaning dirt, but it is a necessary step for apple spawning. Since apples are the only source of points, and they are currently not spawning (due to dirt), delaying cleaning means delaying access to future rewards.
-
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 3). You see agent 2 at (6, 2).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 1).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 7 units away — far from my current position at (6, 3). Eating it would require a long journey and gives only +1.0 point, which is a small immediate reward with no guarantee of future apples.
- The nearest dirt is at (6, 1), just one step below me. Cleaning it would take minimal effort (a single move down to (6, 1), then interact to clean).
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt removal is a prerequisite for apple spawning. By cleaning this dirt, I am enabling future apple generation, which benefits the entire group and increases the long-term potential for rewards.
- There is no immediate, accessible apple nearby. The apple at (12, 2) is out of reach without a significant path through potentially dirty areas.
- Since I cannot move diagonally, moving to (6, 1) is efficient and safe — it's adjacent and directly in line with the dirt.

Therefore, cleaning the dirt at (6, 1) is the optimal action: it provides no immediate reward, but it

--- Step 46 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 6). You see dirt at (6, 7), dirt at (7, 7), agent 3 at (7, 7) and dirt at (8, 7).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to determine the best course of action.

Currently, I am at (7, 6). The observation shows:
- Dirt at (6,7), (7,7), and (8,7)
- Agent 3 is located at (7,7) — this is a key point because it's both a dirt location and occupied by another agent
- The nearest apple is at (2,5), which is 6 steps away — quite far
- The nearest dirt is at (7,7), only 1 step away

The key trade-off is:
1. **Eat an apple** → immediate +1.0 reward, but apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed). Currently, there is dirt at (7,7), so no apples can spawn — so eating an apple now would be impossible anyway.

Wait — this is critical: **Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (less dirt = more apples)**. So if there's dirt present, no apples can be found. Therefore, **there are no apples available for eating now** — even if I were to go to (2,5), it's not currently spawnable because the

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to determine the best course of action.

Currently, I am at (7, 3). The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 steps away. The nearest dirt is at (7, 7), which is only 4 steps away. This is a critical point: apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning that cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apples to appear.

Right now, there are no visible apples nearby, and I see nothing of interest. However, the global scan shows that apples are not currently spawning because dirt remains. The key trade-off is:

1. **Eat an apple immediately** — but there is no apple in immediate range. The nearest is 6 steps away, and I see nothing of interest nearby. Eating an apple would require movement and would not help with the river cleaning. Also, if there are no apples to eat, this action is not feasible.

2. **Clean the dirt at (7,7)** — this is only 4 steps away. Cleaning dirt has no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning. Since apples are currently not spawning (due to dirt), cleaning is essential to allow apples to appear in the future. This action supports
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 7}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 7). You see agent 1 at (7, 6), dirt at (6, 7), dirt at (7, 7), dirt at (8, 7) and dirt at (6, 8).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 7), and the current observation shows that there is dirt at (6,7), (7,7), (8,7), and (6,8). The nearest apple is at (13,7), which is 6 steps away. The nearest dirt is at (7,7), which is 0 distance — meaning I'm standing on dirt.

Let’s analyze the trade-offs:

1. **Eat an apple?**  
   There is no apple visible in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (13,7), which is 6 steps away. To reach it, I’d need to move through potentially dirty terrain. Eating an apple would require first reaching it — which means cleaning dirt along the way (if necessary) and navigating through the grid. Since there are no apples currently spawning (because the river is not clean), I cannot eat an apple *now*. So, **eating an apple is not immediately possible** and would require a long journey with no guaranteed reward in the short term.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   This is crucial. Apples only spawn when the river is clean — i.e., when there is less dirt. Dirt at (6

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 6). You see dirt at (6, 7), agent 3 at (7, 7) and dirt at (8, 7).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

Currently, I am at (7, 6). The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 steps away — quite far. There's no apple in immediate proximity. The only dirt visible is at (6, 7), which is just 1 step away (distance 1 from me at (7,6) — actually, (6,7) is one step left and one step up, so distance is √2, but in grid movement, it's 2 steps: left to (6,6), then up to (6,7) — so 2 steps). The dirt at (8,7) is also 1 step away (right), so distance 1 to (8,7)? Wait: from (7,6) to (8,7) is one right and one up — again, 2 steps.

So both dirt locations are 2 steps away. That’s manageable.

Now, the key trade-off:

1. **Eat an apple** — but there's no apple nearby. The nearest is 6 steps away. Eating it would require a long journey and no immediate reward unless I find one. Since

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 4). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully.

I am at position (7, 4). The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 units away — quite distant. The nearest dirt is at (6, 7), only 4 units away. This suggests that cleaning dirt is relatively close and achievable.

Now, evaluating the trade-offs:

1. **Eating an apple for immediate reward**: Apples give +1.0 each, which is valuable. However, there is no apple visible nearby — the nearest is 6 units away. Moving to it would require a significant path, and since we can't move diagonally, it would take at least 6 steps (minimum Manhattan distance). Also, the apple at (2,5) may only spawn if the river is clean — which depends on dirt being cleaned. If the dirt at (6,7) is not cleaned, apples won’t spawn at all, making the apple at (2,5) inaccessible even if we reach it.

2. **Cleaning dirt to enable future apple spawning**: Cleaning dirt has no immediate reward, but it is essential for apples to spawn. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is reduced), cleaning the

Agent 3 (High-Level):

  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to determine the best course of action.

I am at (7, 7). The immediate surroundings show dirt at (6, 7) and (8, 7), and also at (6, 8). These are all adjacent to my position — specifically, to the west and east. The nearest dirt is at (6, 7), which is just one step away (distance 1). 

There are no apples visible in immediate proximity. The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 6 steps away — far from my current position. That means I cannot eat an apple immediately, and the only way to get apples is to clean dirt first, which will eventually allow apple spawning on land.

Key point: Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning, when dirt is removed. So, cleaning dirt is not a direct reward, but it enables future apple growth. Since I have no apples nearby and the nearest apple is far away, I must consider whether cleaning dirt now is a necessary investment.

Now, evaluating the options:

1. **Eat an apple** — There are no apples nearby. I cannot eat one immediately. So this option is not viable.

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 6). You see dirt at (6, 7), agent 3 at (6, 7) and dirt at (8, 7).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to determine the best course of action.

Current position: (6, 6)  
Immediate surroundings:
- Dirt at (6, 7) — directly ahead
- Agent 3 is located at (6, 7) — same location as the dirt
- Dirt at (8, 7) — to the right

Global scan:
- Nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away
- Nearest dirt is at (6, 7), only 1 step away

Key considerations:

1. **Should I eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There is no apple in immediate range. The nearest apple is at (2, 5), requiring a path through multiple tiles. Eating an apple would require movement to reach it, and there’s no apple visible or accessible right now. So, **no immediate apple can be eaten**. This option is not viable.

2. **Should I clean dirt to ensure future apples spawn?**  
   → Yes. Dirt at (6, 7) is directly adjacent and is blocking access to a potentially valuable resource. Cleaning it would:
   - Remove a barrier (the dirt)
   - However, **apples only spawn when dirt is cleaned**. Since there is no dirt listed in the global scan, we must assume that **no apples are currently available** — or at least, the apple at (13,0) is
  Decision: {'action': 'random_explore', 'args': {}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (9, 5). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: The current observation shows that you are at (9, 5), seeing nothing of interest nearby. The global scan reveals that the nearest apple is at (13, 6), which is 5 units away — a reasonable distance, but not immediate. Crucially, **there is no dirt listed in the global scan**, meaning there is no dirt to clean.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward**:  
   There is no apple visible nearby, and the nearest apple is at (13, 6), which requires movement. Since you are not currently in proximity to any apple, eating one is not possible. Even if you could move there, you’d have to traverse a distance of 5 steps (either right and up, or diagonally — but you can't move diagonally). Since no apple is visible or accessible now, this option is not viable.

2. **Clean dirt to ensure future apples spawn**:  
   There is **no dirt** in the global scan. This suggests that either dirt is not present in the area, or it's hidden in a region not yet scanned. However, apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be present to clean *before* apples can appear.

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 1). You see agent 1 at (9, 0).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

**Current Position:** (8, 1)  
**Agent 1 Location:** (9, 0) — adjacent, possibly a potential interaction point.  
**Nearest Apple:** (12, 2), distance = 5 steps.  
**Nearest Dirt:** *None found* in the global scan.  

This is a critical point: **there is no dirt visible** in the global scan. That means there is currently no dirt to clean — so the condition for apple spawning (clean river) is already met or not applicable.  

But wait: apples only spawn *when the river is clean*, and cleaning dirt enables that. Since no dirt is visible, it implies either:
- The dirt is far away (beyond current range), or  
- The river is already clean (so apples can spawn naturally).

Given that the nearest apple is at (12, 2) — 5 steps away — and there's no dirt to clean, **there is no immediate benefit to cleaning dirt**, because there’s nothing to clean.

Now, consider the two options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (10, 0). You see agent 3 at (9, 1).
  Thinking: The current observation shows that I am at (10, 0), and the nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is only 3 units away — a very short distance. This suggests that an apple is reachable immediately without any complex movement. 

However, the global scan indicates that **there is no dirt nearby** to clean. This is a critical point: apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Since no dirt is currently visible or detectable in the scan, cleaning dirt is not an immediate option — and thus, there is no active dirt to clean to enable future apple spawning.

Therefore, the trade-off analysis becomes:

1. **Eat an apple?**  
   Yes — the apple at (13, 0) is within reach (distance = 3), and since we are on land, it can be eaten immediately. Eating an apple gives +1.0 point, which is a direct, tangible reward. There is no immediate benefit to cleaning dirt in this scenario, because no dirt exists to clean.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apples?**  
   Not applicable — no dirt is present. Cleaning dirt would require first locating dirt, which isn't in the global scan. Without dirt, there

The nearest apple is at (13, 6), which is 4 units away — a reasonable distance, but not immediate.  
Crucially, the global scan indicates **no dirt is nearby**. This is significant because:

- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when there is less dirt).  
- Cleaning dirt gives **no immediate reward**, but it is **necessary** for future apple spawning.  
- There is **no dirt to clean** currently — meaning the river is already clean in this region.  

So, the trade-off becomes:

1. **Eat an apple?**  
   → The apple at (13,6) is within reach (4 units away). You can move to it, and eating it gives +1.0 point.  
   → However, since there is no dirt to clean, cleaning isn't needed — the system is already in a state where apples can spawn.  
   → Therefore, eating an apple is not only possible, but **it's the only immediate action that yields a reward**.

  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

You are currently at (9, 1).  
You see Agent 1 at (10, 0).  
The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is a distance of 4 steps away.  
The global scan indicates **no dirt is nearby** — meaning there is no dirt to clean.

Now, consider the trade-offs:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   - An apple gives +1.0 point immediately.  
   - The apple at (12, 2) is 4 steps away — reachable, but not within immediate range.  
   - However, **there is no dirt to clean**, so no apples can spawn regardless.  
   - Therefore, **apples cannot spawn in the future**, because apple spawning is contingent on the river being clean (i.e., dirt being cleaned).  
   - So, if we don’t clean dirt, no apples will appear — even if we go to (12, 2), we won’t be able to eat one unless it's already there.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apples?**  
   - There is **no dirt visible** in the global scan.

--- Step 49 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (11, 0). You see agent 3 at (9, 0) and an apple at (13, 0).
  Thinking: The current observation shows that there is an apple at (13, 0), which is just 2 steps away — a very short distance. This means eating the apple would give an immediate +1.0 reward with minimal effort.  

However, the global scan indicates **no dirt is nearby**, which means there is currently no dirt to clean. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt has been removed), cleaning dirt is not immediately beneficial unless dirt is present. In this case, there is no dirt to clean, so the "future apple spawning" benefit from cleaning does not apply.

Therefore, the trade-off analysis is:

- **Eating the apple** is viable and gives immediate reward with no risk. It doesn’t require any action beyond moving to (13, 0) and consuming it.
- **Cleaning dirt** is not applicable because there is no dirt to clean. Attempting to clean non-existent dirt would be inefficient and pointless.
- **Exploring** is unnecessary since the nearest apple is already within reach and no dirt is present to justify exploration.

Thus, the optimal action is to **eat the apple at (13, 0)** — it provides immediate value, aligns with the goal

--- Step 49 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (1, 0). You see an apple at (1, 0).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Here's the reasoning:

- The apple is directly at my current position (1, 0), so I can eat it immediately for +1.0 point — this is a guaranteed, immediate reward with no risk.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 1), which is 7 units away. Cleaning it would require movement and time, and there is no immediate benefit from cleaning it — apples only spawn *when the river is clean*, which means dirt removal is a prerequisite for future apple generation, not a direct reward.
- Since no apples are currently spawning due to dirt, and the dirt is far away, there is no immediate benefit to cleaning it now. The group's long-term benefit is not at risk — we already have an apple available.
- There is no indication of any other immediate threats or opportunities. The current situation is optimal for immediate gain.

Therefore, the trade-off favors immediate action: eating the apple gives a clear, positive reward without sacrificing future potential. Future apple spawning depends on cleaning dirt, which is not urgent or necessary in this moment. I should act now to maximize immediate points.

Action: Eat the apple at (1, 0).
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 1, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'eat'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 5). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (7, 7).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 4 units away. That means it's not immediately accessible without moving through several tiles. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and the current state shows dirt at (7, 7), we must consider whether cleaning that dirt will enable future apple spawning.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 point, but it's not a strategic move if apples are not spawning due to dirty conditions. If we don't clean the dirt, apples will not appear at all — meaning we miss out on future rewards entirely.
- The dirt at (7, 7) is only 3 units away (distance), which is manageable. Since movement is restricted to cardinal directions (no diagonals), I can reach it in a few steps: (6,5) → (7,5) → (7,6) → (7,7).
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it's essential for enabling apple spawning. This is a long-term investment that benefits the group (and ultimately me, as apples are the only way to gain points).
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 7}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 7). You see dirt at (7, 7), dirt at (8, 7), dirt at (6, 8) and dirt at (7, 8).
  Thinking: I am at (6, 7). The current observation shows dirt at (7, 7), (8, 7), (6, 8), and (7, 8). These are all adjacent to my position, meaning I can easily reach and clean them. 

The global scan indicates that the nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 units away — quite far. There is no apple in immediate proximity (within 1–2 steps), and no visible apple on land currently. The river is currently dirty (due to the presence of dirt), which means apples are not spawning. Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning that cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple generation.

Now, evaluating the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple at my current location or nearby. The nearest apple is far away (distance 6), and I cannot reach it without first cleaning dirt. Eating an apple would require being on land with an apple, which currently does not exist. So, immediate reward is not available.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   This is critical. The dirt at (7,7), (8,7

--- Step 50 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (1, 0). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: Given the current situation, let's analyze the trade-offs carefully:

1. **Should you eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 units away. You are currently at (1, 0). Moving to (2, 5) would require a path through open terrain, possibly crossing empty or unexplored areas. However, there are no apples visible nearby, and the apple is far away. Eating an apple now would give +1.0 point, but it would require significant movement and time. More importantly, **apples only spawn when the river is clean** — meaning that without cleaning dirt, apples may not appear at all. So, if we don’t clean dirt, future apple spawns are unlikely. Therefore, eating an apple now might be a short-term gain with no long-term benefit, especially if the apples are not guaranteed to spawn anyway.

2. **Should you clean dirt to ensure future apples spawn?**  
   The nearest dirt is at (7, 1), which is 7 units away — farther than the apple. However, cleaning dirt is essential for enabling apple spawning. If we don’t clean it, the river remains dirty, and apples won’t
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to make the best decision.

Currently, I am at (7, 5). The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away — a significant distance. The nearest dirt is at (7, 7), just 2 units away. This means I can reach the dirt quickly, and cleaning it would have a direct impact on enabling future apple spawning.

Key considerations:
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately, but apples only spawn when the river is clean. If I eat an apple now, I’m consuming a resource that might not be sustainable — especially if there are no apples nearby to spawn in the future.
- Cleaning dirt has no immediate reward, but it enables apples to spawn later. Since the nearest apple is 5 units away and the dirt is only 2 units away, I can clean it efficiently and enable future apple generation.
- The global scan shows that apples are currently not spawning because the river isn't clean. Without cleaning dirt, apples won’t appear, even if I move toward them.
- There’s no immediate apple in sight, and I’m not in a position to eat one without a long journey.

Therefore, the trade-off is:
- Immediate reward
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 7}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 7). You see dirt at (7, 7), dirt at (8, 7), dirt at (6, 8) and dirt at (7, 8).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 7), and the current observation shows dirt at (7, 7), (8, 7), (6,8), and (7,8). The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 6 steps away. There is no apple currently visible in my immediate vicinity — only dirt. 

Key points to consider:

1. **Immediate reward vs. future benefit**:
   - Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately, but there are no apples available at my current location.
   - The only apples in the global scan are at (13,7), which is 6 steps away — not currently accessible due to dirt blocking the path.
   - Therefore, **eating an apple is not possible right now**. There is no immediate reward to be gained from this action.

2. **Cleaning dirt for future apple spawning**:
   - Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed).
   - The dirt at (7,7), (8,7), (6,8), and (7,8) are blocking access to clean land and thus prevent apple spawning.
- If I go to eat the apple at (12, 7), I get a +1.0 reward immediately. But I don’t clean any dirt — so I’m not contributing to the river’s cleanliness. Future apple spawns are still dependent on cleaning dirt

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 0). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 2), even though there's no immediate reward.

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (3, 1), which is 4 units away — a significant distance. Moving there directly would require a long path and likely pass through or near dirt, which may be blocking apple spawning.
- The nearest dirt is at (6, 2), just 2 units away — very accessible. Cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apples to spawn. Without cleaning dirt, apples won’t appear, even if they’re nearby.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0, but it's not a strategic move because:
  - There's no apple currently visible in a nearby, accessible location.
  - Apples only spawn when the river is clean — so if we don’t clean dirt, future apple spawns are blocked.
  - The goal is to maximize points over time, not just in the short term.
- Cleaning dirt at (6, 2) is a high-impact, low-effort action that enables future apple spawns. This supports the group's long-term success.
- Since there’s no immediate apple in range and the dirt is close, it makes sense to prioritize clearing dirt first.
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 2}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (3, 4). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 2) to enable future apple spawning.

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (3, 1), which is only 3 steps away. However, apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be removed. Currently, there is dirt at (6, 2), 5 steps away. This dirt is blocking apple spawning in the system.
- Eating an apple now gives a +1.0 reward, but it's a short-term gain. The apples at (3, 1) may not spawn at all unless the river is clean — so eating an apple now might be futile if the environment remains dirty.
- Cleaning dirt is not immediately rewarding, but it enables future apple spawning. Since apples are the only source of points, and they only appear when the river is clean, this action is essential for long-term success.
- The global scan shows no immediate apple spawns, and the dirt is not close enough to be reachable without a plan. Moving to (6, 2) to clean it would take 5 steps, but it's a necessary investment.
- There's no indication of any immediate danger or resource that justifies immediate apple consumption over environmental improvement.

Therefore,
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 2}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Moving from (11, 5) towards (12, 7).
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (11, 5). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully and make a strategic decision based on the rules and objectives.

Currently, I am at (11, 5). The nearest apple is at (12, 7), which is only 3 steps away — a very short distance. Eating that apple would give me an immediate +1.0 reward. However, the global scan shows that the nearest dirt is at (6, 2), which is 8 steps away. This dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning in the future — a long-term benefit for the group.

But here’s the key: **apples only spawn when the river is clean**. That means cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple generation. However, right now, there are no apples spawning because the river is not clean. So, even though apples are nearby, they are not currently available due to the dirt condition.

Wait — the observation says: "You see nothing of interest nearby." But the global scan says the nearest apple is at (12,7). That suggests it's visible in the broader world state, even if not directly visible from (11,5). So, is the apple actually present and accessible?

Yes — the apple at (12,7

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 1). You see dirt at (6, 2).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 2).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (3, 1), which is 3 units away — that's a significant distance, and moving there would require navigating through potentially dirty terrain. More importantly, apples only spawn when the river is clean, meaning dirt must be removed to enable apple growth. Right now, there's dirt at (6, 2), which is directly adjacent to my current position. This dirt is blocking apple spawning in that area.

- Eating an apple now would give a +1.0 reward, but there are no apples visible in the immediate vicinity (only at (3,1), which is far away). Moreover, if the dirt remains, no apples will spawn in the future — which means the long-term reward (apples) is completely blocked.

- Cleaning the dirt at (6, 2) is a necessary step to enable future apple spawning. Since apples spawn only when the river is clean, removing this dirt will allow apples to appear in the future, possibly even at (3,1) or nearby. This action supports the group's goal of maximizing apple harvest over time.

- There is no immediate reward in eating an apple, and the apple at
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 2}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Moving from (4, 4) towards (6, 2).
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (4, 4). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 2) to enable future apple spawning.

Here’s the reasoning:

- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. This means that cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apple generation, not a direct reward.
- The nearest apple is at (3, 1), which is 4 units away — far from my current position (4, 4). Even if I could reach it, there's no guarantee it will remain there or spawn again.
- The nearest dirt is at (6, 2), also 4 units away. This is the only actionable step that directly enables future apple spawning.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 point, but if the river remains dirty, future apples won’t spawn — meaning long-term rewards are lost.
- Since apples are a limited resource (they only appear when the river is clean), and we are in a cooperative cleanup game where cleaning benefits the group, the strategic value of cleaning dirt is higher than taking a short-term reward.
- There is no immediate visible interest nearby, so exploring blindly would be inefficient. Instead, moving toward the dirt at (6, 2) is the most logical and strategic move.

Therefore, I should move toward (

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (12, 5). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the trade-off between immediate reward and long-term benefit.

Currently, I am at (12, 5). The nearest apple is at (12, 7), which is only 2 steps away — a very short distance. Eating that apple would give me +1.0 point immediately. That seems like a straightforward, low-effort gain.

However, the nearest dirt is at (6, 2), which is 9 units away. Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning — meaning that without cleaning dirt, apples won’t appear at all. But cleaning dirt doesn’t give any immediate reward, and it takes time and movement.

The key question is: **Is there a balance between immediate gain and future potential?**

Right now, there *is* an apple within reach. There's no indication that the river is currently dirty or that apple spawning is disabled. The global scan shows the nearest apple is at (12, 7), and since I'm already at (12, 5), I can reach it in two moves — up to (12, 6), then to (12, 7).

  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 1, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 0). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 1 at (1, 1).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only 1 step away — this is a direct, positive reward (+1.0 point) with no risk.
- The nearest dirt is at (6, 5), which is 9 steps away — far beyond immediate reach. Cleaning it would provide future apple spawning, but it’s not feasible or urgent given the current state.
- There is no immediate threat or obstacle that prevents me from eating the apple.
- Agent 1 is at (1, 1), which is adjacent to the apple, but there's no indication they are blocking me or that they are a threat. I have no information about their intentions or actions.
- Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and the river is currently dirty (implied by the absence of apples elsewhere), cleaning dirt is a long-term strategy. However, without any immediate benefit from cleaning, and with a nearby apple, acting on immediate opportunity is more efficient.
- In a cleanup game where points are maximized, immediate rewards are critical — especially when future rewards depend on actions that are far away and require significant effort.

Therefore, the optimal decision is to eat the apple at (1, 0

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 3). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the trade-off between immediate reward and long-term benefit.

Currently, I'm at (7, 3). The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — quite far. There is no apple visible nearby, and I see nothing of interest in the immediate vicinity. The nearest dirt is at (7, 5), which is only 2 units away — directly above me. 

Key points:
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately, but apples only spawn *when the river is clean* (i.e., when dirt is removed).
- Dirt cleaning has no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning — which is essential for the group’s long-term success.
- Since the nearest dirt is only 2 units away, it's very accessible and low-effort to clean.
- There are no nearby apples, so eating one now would be pointless — no apple is available to consume at this moment.
- The apple at (12, 2) is far away and will not spawn unless the river is clean. Without cleaning dirt, apples won't appear at all.

Therefore:

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (1, 1). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 2 at (2, 0).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only 1 step away — this is a direct, low-effort, high-reward opportunity. Eating it gives me +1.0 point immediately, which contributes directly to my score.
- The nearest dirt is at (6, 5), which is 9 steps away. Cleaning it would require significant movement and time, and there's no indication that apples will spawn in the near future or that the group's long-term goals are more urgent than my immediate scoring.
- There is no threat or interference from agent 2 at (2, 0) that would prevent me from safely eating the apple. The distance between me and agent 2 is only 1 step (to (2, 0)), but since they are not blocking movement or attacking, and no rules state that agents interfere with apple consumption, I can safely proceed.
- The rule states that apples only spawn when the river is clean — but this is a *future* condition. Since the current apple is already present, it is already valid for consumption. Waiting to clean dirt would delay immediate rewards and potentially miss opportunities for future apples, which may not materialize anyway.

Agent 2 (High-Level):

  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only 1 step away — this is a direct, positive reward (+1.0 point) with no risk.
- The nearest dirt is at (6, 5), which is 9 units away. Cleaning it would require significant movement and time, and there is no immediate benefit from doing so — apples only spawn when the river is clean, which is a long-term, indirect benefit.
- There is no indication that the dirt at (6, 5) is currently affecting the river or apple spawning in any immediate way. The current state shows apples already exist at (1, 0), so we don't need to clean to get apples — we can simply consume them.
- Agent 1 is at (1, 1), which is adjacent to the apple at (1, 0). If I eat the apple now, I gain a point immediately. If I wait to clean dirt, I risk missing out on this immediate reward and delay future gains, which are uncertain and far off.
- Since I cannot move diagonally, I can only move in cardinal directions, and (1, 0) is directly accessible from (2,

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 4). You see dirt at (6, 5) and dirt at (7, 5).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 4). The current observation shows dirt at (6, 5) and (7, 5). The global scan indicates that the nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 7 units away, and the nearest dirt is at (7, 5), just 1 unit away.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple visible in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is far away at (12, 2), and we are currently on land with dirt present. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), we cannot currently eat an apple. Eating one would require being in a location with an apple, which we aren’t. So, this option is not viable right now.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   This is critical. Dirt at (7, 5) is only 1 unit away — very close. Cleaning it would reduce the dirt level in the river, which increases the chance of apples spawning later. Since apples spawn only when the river is clean (less dirt), removing this dirt is a necessary step to enable future apple growth

- The nearest dirt is at (6, 5), which is 9 steps away. Cleaning it would require significant movement and time, with no immediate benefit. There's no indication that cleaning dirt will spawn apples in a way that justifies the delay or cost, especially since apples are already present and accessible.
- There is no threat from Agent 2 at (2, 0) that would make movement risky. Agent 2 is not blocking the apple, and we have a clear path to (1, 0) — moving left from (1, 1) to (1, 0) is safe and straightforward.
- The goal is to maximize points. Eating an apple now gives a guaranteed +1.0 point. Delaying that action to clean dirt would only be rational if apples were not already available and if future apple spawns were likely to be significantly more abundant. There is no evidence of that here.
- There's no indication that cleaning dirt would improve the situation for the group in a way that outweighs the immediate
- Option 2: Clean dirt → but no dirt is found in the global scan

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 6). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully.

Currently, I am at (6, 6). The nearest apple is at (3, 6), which is 3 units away — a relatively short distance. Eating that apple would give me an immediate +1.0 reward. That’s a clear, tangible benefit with no risk.

However, the dirt is at (8, 0), which is 8 units away. Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable future apple spawning, which benefits the group. But cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward — only long-term benefit. Also, dirt is far away, and moving to (8, 0) would require a long path (likely going through unexplored areas), which might not be efficient.

Now, considering the trade-off:
- Immediate reward: Yes — I can eat the apple at (3, 6) in 3 steps (left 3 units).
- Future benefit: The dirt is far away, and there’s no indication that apples are currently spawning due to dirt. The global scan shows apples are already present at (3, 6), meaning the river is likely already clean enough for apples to spawn — so cleaning dirt may not be necessary *now*.
- Exploration: There’s nothing of interest
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 3, 'coord_y': 6}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 2). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the current situation and make a strategic decision based on the trade-off between immediate reward and long-term group benefit.

Current position: (8, 2)  
Nearest Apple: (5, 0) — distance = 5  
Nearest Dirt: (8, 0) — distance = 2  

Key observations:
- The nearest apple is 5 steps away — a significant distance.
- The nearest dirt is only 2 steps away (at (8, 0)), which means it's directly below me.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately, but cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward — only enables future apple spawning.
- I cannot move diagonally, so movement is constrained to cardinal directions.

Critical reasoning:
- I am currently at (8, 2). The dirt at (8, 0) is directly below me — only 2 steps away (down to (8,1), then (8,0)).
- Cleaning this dirt would make the river cleaner, which increases the chance of apples spawning in the future — including potentially at (5,0) or other nearby locations.
- The
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (4, 3). You see an apple at (3, 2).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (3, 2).

Here's the reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only 2 steps away — a very short distance. Since apples provide +1.0 points each, and there is no immediate reward for cleaning dirt, the immediate benefit of eating the apple is clear and tangible.
- The nearest dirt is at (8, 0), which is 7 units away. Cleaning it would require a significant movement cost and no immediate reward. Moreover, the global scan shows that apples only spawn when the river is clean, which implies that dirt cleaning is a long-term, indirect strategy. Since we don’t yet have a confirmed need for future apples (e.g., no indication that apples are currently absent or that future spawns are expected), this action is not urgent.
- There is no other nearby apple or dirt to consider. The apple at (3, 2) is the only one visible and is within reach.
- In a cleanup game where you want to maximize points, and apples are the primary scoring mechanism, taking available rewards is optimal unless there is a clear, immediate necessity to clean dirt (e.g., if the river is visibly dirty and apples are not spawning at all).

Therefore, eating the apple now provides

--- Step 50 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (5, 6). You see an apple at (3, 6).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (3, 6).

Here's the reasoning:

- The apple is at (3, 6), which is only 2 steps away — a very short distance. Since movement is not diagonal, it will take exactly 2 moves (left to (4,6), then left to (3,6)) to reach it. This is a straightforward, immediate action with a clear +1.0 reward.
- The nearest dirt is at (8, 0), which is 9 units away — far beyond any immediate practical reach. Cleaning that dirt would require a significant effort with no immediate benefit, and since apples only spawn *when the river is clean*, it's a long-term, indirect benefit.
- There is no immediate threat or obstacle mentioned, and no other apples or dirt are closer than the one at (8, 0).
- In a cleanup game where immediate rewards are available and future rewards are conditional and distant, the principle of maximizing immediate utility while enabling future gains should be balanced. However, in this case, there is a clear, accessible apple with no risk, and no reason to delay eating it for a distant, uncertain benefit.
- Since the apple is already visible and spawn conditions are currently met (we
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 3, 'coord_y': 6}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (8, 1). You see dirt at (8, 0).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to determine the best course of action.

I am currently at (8, 1), and I see dirt at (8, 0). The nearest apple is at (5, 0), which is 4 units away. The dirt at (8, 0) is only 1 unit away — very close. 

Key points:
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. This means dirt must be removed to enable apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 immediately, which is a direct reward.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward but enables future apple spawning, which benefits the group (and potentially me in the long run).
- I cannot move diagonally, so movement is constrained to up/down/left/right.

Right now, there are no apples visible nearby — the nearest is 4 units away. The dirt is directly adjacent (at (8,0)), which means I can clean it immediately with one move (down to (8,0)).

If I eat an apple now, I get +1.0, but:
- There’s no apple at (8,1) or nearby.
- The apple at (5,0) is far away and currently not
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 8, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (3, 3). You see an apple at (3, 2).
  Thinking: Given the current situation, I should **eat the apple at (3, 2)**.

### Reasoning:

1. **Immediate Reward vs. Future Benefit**:
   - Eating the apple at (3, 2) gives me +1.0 point immediately — a clear, tangible gain.
   - The dirt at (8, 0) is far away (distance 8), meaning cleaning it will not provide any benefit in the near term. There is no indication that cleaning this dirt will spawn apples soon, and the path to it is long and resource-intensive.
   - Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and the current river state is not known to be clean, cleaning dirt is a long-term investment with uncertain payoff. Without any immediate benefit from cleaning, and with no visible or near-term apple spawns, it's not a priority.

2. **Proximity and Opportunity**:
   - The apple is at (3, 2), which is just one step away. This is a direct, low-effort opportunity to gain points.
   - There is no other apple nearby, and no dirt within a short range to justify a detour. Moving to clean dirt would require traversing a long distance (8 steps) with no immediate
Even though the nearest apple is far away (6 units), I have no access to apples at all right now —
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 7}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (1, 0). You see an apple at (1, 0) and an apple at (2, 1).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0) for immediate reward.

Reasoning:

- The apple at (1, 0) is directly adjacent and within reach — distance 0. This means I can immediately gain +1.0 point by eating it without any risk or cost.
- The nearest dirt is at (6, 7), which is 12 units away. Cleaning that dirt would require a significant amount of movement and time, and there's no immediate benefit from it — apples only spawn when the river is clean, but no apples are currently spawning, and the apple at (2, 1) is already present and accessible.
- There's no indication that cleaning dirt will produce any immediate benefit or that future apple spawns are imminent. The global scan shows no current apple spawns due to dirt — only that dirt exists at a far distance.
- Since I am already at (1, 0), and there's an apple right where I am, acting immediately maximizes my current score without sacrificing future potential.
- The trade-off between immediate reward and future group benefit is unfavorable here: eating the apple provides a clear, immediate benefit with no cost, while cleaning dirt is far away, uncertain, and offers no present value.

Therefore, the
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 1, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'eat'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 7). You see agent 1 at (7, 6), dirt at (6, 7), dirt at (8, 7) and dirt at (6, 8).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am at (7, 7).  
- Agent 1 is at (7, 6), directly above me.  
- There is dirt at (6, 7), (8, 7), and (6, 8).  
- The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 6 steps away.  
- The nearest dirt is at (6, 7), only 1 step away — very close.  

Key point: Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Dirt blocks apple spawning. So cleaning dirt is essential to enable apples to appear in the future.  

Right now, there are no apples visible in the immediate vicinity — only the distant one at (13, 7), which is far away and currently unreachable without first clearing obstacles.  

**Option 1: Eat an apple**  
- Immediate reward: +1.0  
- But there are no apples visible near me. I’m at (7,7), and no apple is in my immediate vicinity.  
- The nearest apple is at (13,7), which is 6 steps away — and only if the river is clean.

--- Step 48 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 6). You see dirt at (6, 7), agent 3 at (6, 7) and dirt at (8, 7).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

Current position: (6, 6)  
Visible dirt: (6, 7) — directly ahead, 1 step away  
Agent 3 is at (6, 7) — same location as the dirt  
Dirt at (8, 7) — to the right, 2 steps away  
Nearest apple: (2, 5) — distance 5 steps away (not immediately reachable)  
The river is currently dirty, so apples are not spawning. Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned.

Key point: **Apples do not spawn unless the river is clean.** So, even if I eat an apple, there are none available right now. The nearest apple is 5 steps away and requires the river to be clean first. Since there's dirt at (6,7) and (8,7), the river is currently dirty — no apples can spawn.

Therefore:
- **Option 1 (eat an apple):** Not possible right now — no apples are available. Eating would be futile.
- **Option 2 (clean dirt):** Critical. Cleaning the dirt at (6,7) will make
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 7}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (1, 0). You see an apple at (2, 1).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (2, 1).

Reasoning:

- The apple is at a distance of 2 from my current position (1, 0), which is very close and reachable in two moves (right to (2, 0), then up to (2, 1)). This is a low-effort, high-reward action with immediate +1.0 point gain.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 1), which is 7 units away — far beyond the immediate range. Cleaning it would require significant movement and time, and there is no indication that dirt cleanup will spawn apples in a way that justifies such a long-term investment without immediate benefit.
- There is no visible apple nearby that would require cleaning dirt to spawn — the apple at (2, 1) is already present and accessible.
- The rules state that apples only spawn when the river is clean, but in this situation, we already have an apple. This means the apple is already available, so no dirt cleaning is needed to access it.
- Since the apple is already there and we can reach it in two steps, eating it provides immediate reward with no risk or delay.

Therefore, the optimal action is to eat the apple at (2,
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 2, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 7). You see agent 1 at (6, 6), dirt at (6, 7), dirt at (8, 7), dirt at (6, 8) and dirt at (7, 8).
  Thinking: I am at (6, 7), which is currently covered in dirt. There's no apple visible at my current location — in fact, the only apple in the global scan is at (2, 5), which is quite far away (distance 6). The nearest dirt is at (6, 7), which I'm already standing on, meaning I'm directly adjacent to dirt that needs cleaning.

Let’s break down the options:

1. **Eat an apple** – There is no apple at (6, 7) or nearby. The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 units away. Since I’m currently on dirt, I can't eat an apple immediately. So eating an apple is not possible now. Even if I could, it would be a poor trade-off because apples only spawn *when the river is clean*, and currently, the river (or land) is dirty. So no apples are available for consumption now.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning** – This is critical. The rule states: *Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (less dirt = more apples)*. Therefore, cleaning dirt is necessary to unlock apple spawning. Right now, I’m standing on

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 6). You see agent 3 at (6, 7), dirt at (7, 7) and dirt at (8, 7).
  Thinking: I should **clean the dirt at (7, 7)** to enable future apple spawning.

Here’s the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away — a significant distance. Moving there directly would require a long path, and there's no immediate reward for eating an apple now, especially since apples only spawn *when the river is clean*.
- The dirt at (7, 7) is within a very short distance (distance 2 from my current position at (6,6)) — I can reach it in just one move (to (7,7)) and clean it.
- Cleaning dirt doesn’t give immediate points, but it enables future apple spawning. Since apples only appear when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt), removing dirt at (7,7) will increase the chance of apples appearing in the area, especially near the river.
- The presence of dirt at (8,7) suggests a dirt cluster, possibly along a river path. Cleaning this dirt contributes to long-term sustainability of apple availability.
- There’s no immediate benefit in eating an apple now — the nearest one is far away and not accessible without first ensuring the environment is conducive to apple growth.

--- Step 48 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 0). You see dirt at (6, 1).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 1).

Reasoning:

- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Currently, there is dirt at (6, 1), which is directly adjacent to my position. This dirt is blocking the potential for apple spawning in that area.
- The nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 7 units away — quite far. Eating it now would give only +1.0 point, but it would not address the root cause of limited apple availability.
- Cleaning the dirt at (6, 1) has no immediate reward, but it's essential for enabling future apple spawning. Once that dirt is cleaned, land becomes viable for apples to appear, potentially leading to more apple opportunities down the line.
- Since I’m already at (6, 0) and the dirt is at (6, 1), I can move down to (6, 1) and clean it with a single move — this is efficient and low-risk.
- The group's long-term success depends on clean land, so contributing to that by cleaning dirt is a strategic investment, even without immediate gain.

Therefore, the optimal action is to clean the dirt at (6, 1) to enable

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 2). You see dirt at (6, 1) and agent 3 at (6, 3).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 1).

Reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — quite far, and currently not accessible because the river is dirty. Apples only spawn when the river is clean, meaning that cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apple generation.
- The dirt at (6, 1) is only 1 unit away — immediately adjacent — making it the most accessible dirt patch. Cleaning it would directly improve the river's cleanliness and enable apple spawning in the future.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 point, but there are no apples currently visible or reachable without first cleaning dirt. The apple at (12, 2) is not spawnable until the river is clean, so it's not available for immediate consumption.
- Agent 3 is at (6, 3), which is one step away from the dirt at (6, 1), but that doesn’t change the fact that cleaning dirt is necessary for apple spawning. There's no indication that agent 3 is doing anything beneficial or blocking access.
- The trade-off between immediate reward and long-term benefit: while eating an apple now gives immediate points, it would be ineffective because apples

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 3). You see agent 2 at (6, 2).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision.

I am at (6, 3), and I see Agent 2 at (6, 2) — directly below me. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 7 units away. That's quite far. The nearest dirt is at (6, 1), which is only 1 unit below me — very close.

The key rule is: **Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (less dirt = more apples).** So, cleaning dirt is essential for future apple spawning. However, cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward — it's purely a prerequisite for future rewards.

Right now, there are no apples visible nearby — the nearest is 7 units away. That means we’re not in a position to gain immediate apple points. Also, since apples only spawn when the river is clean, if we don’t clean dirt, we won’t get apples in the future — which means the group’s ability to earn points is limited.

The dirt at (6, 1) is just one step away — I can move there and clean it. This action will improve the river's cleanliness, enabling future apple spawning. Even though it doesn't

--- Step 49 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 0). You see dirt at (6, 1).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 1).

Here's the reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 7 units away — far from immediate reach.
- The dirt at (6, 1) is the nearest dirt patch, just one step away. Cleaning it will improve the river's cleanliness, which directly increases the chance of apples spawning in the future.
- Eating an apple now would give a +1.0 reward, but there are no apples available at (6, 0) or nearby. The apple at (13, 0) is too distant to be accessible without first improving the environment.
- Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning, the immediate action must prioritize environmental improvement.
- Cleaning dirt does not give immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning — which is essential for long-term point accumulation.
- Moving to (6, 1) to clean it is a minimal cost (only one step), and it directly supports the core mechanic of the game.

Therefore, the optimal strategy is to clean the dirt at (6, 1). This action enables future apple spawning
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 2). You see dirt at (6, 1) and agent 3 at (6, 3).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 1).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — quite far. Eating it would give +1.0 reward, but it's not immediately accessible or guaranteed to be available in the near term.
- The dirt at (6, 1) is only 1 unit away — very close. Cleaning it will improve the river's cleanliness, which increases the chance of apples spawning in the future. This is a prerequisite for apple generation: apples only spawn when the river is clean.
- There is no immediate apple spawn nearby, and the only apple in the global scan is far away. Without cleaning dirt, future apple spawning is unlikely.
- Agent 3 is at (6, 3), which is one cell away from me and one cell away from the dirt. They may be aware of this or could potentially interfere, but there's no indication of conflict or threat.
- Since movement is restricted to cardinal directions and no diagonal movement is allowed, I can move up to (5,2), then left/right or down to reach (6,1) safely.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawns —
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 3). You see agent 2 at (6, 2).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully to determine the best course of action.

Current position: (6, 3)  
Agent 2 is at (6, 2) — directly below me, so we're in the same column.  
Nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 7 units away — quite far.  
Nearest dirt is at (6, 1), only 2 units away — very close and directly below me.

Rule: Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt). Cleaning dirt has no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning.  
I can only move orthogonally (up, down, left, right), no diagonals.

So, the trade-off is:
- Option 1: Eat an apple → immediate +1.0 point, but the nearest apple is 7 units away — I’d have to walk there and likely pass through dirt or barren zones. There’s no apple visible nearby.
- Option 2: Clean dirt at (6,1) → removes dirt, improves river cleanliness, enabling apples to spawn later. This is essential for long-term success, especially since apples are only available when the river is clean.

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 4). You see dirt at (6, 3).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 3).

Here's the reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 steps away. That means it's not immediately accessible, and even if I were to eat it, it would require a significant movement cost.
- The dirt at (6, 3) is only 1 step away — very close — and cleaning it directly contributes to making the environment more fertile for future apple spawning. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when there is less dirt), removing this dirt will increase the chance of apples appearing in the future, especially in nearby areas.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 point, but it's not a high-value immediate reward given the distance and the fact that apples are rare and depend on clean conditions. Moreover, if I eat an apple now, I'm not improving the environment for future apple growth — which is a key part of the group's long-term success.
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but it's a necessary prerequisite for apple spawning. In this case, it's the most efficient action — minimal movement, maximum environmental benefit.
- There's no indication of other dirt or apple clusters nearby, so

  Thinking: I am at (6, 7), and the current observation shows that there is dirt at (6, 7), (8, 7), and (6, 8). The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 steps away — quite far. There is no apple currently visible nearby, and the only dirt present is at my current location and adjacent spots.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   → There is no apple in sight. The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is far away and requires movement through potentially dirty terrain. Eating an apple now would require being on land with an apple, which doesn’t exist currently. So, **no apple is available to eat**. This option is not viable.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   → This is critical. The rule states: *Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (less dirt = more apples)*. So, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apples to appear. Currently, there is dirt at (6, 7), (8, 7), and (6, 8). Cleaning any of this will reduce dirt and increase

Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 6). You see agent 3 at (6, 7) and dirt at (8, 7).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

You are currently at (6, 6).  
Agent 3 is at (6, 7), directly north of you.  
There is dirt at (8, 7), which is east of you.  
The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 5 units away — quite far.  
The nearest dirt (for cleaning) is at (6, 8), which is only 2 units away — very close.

**Key rule**: Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. So, cleaning dirt is essential to enable apple spawning. There is no immediate reward for cleaning, but it enables future apple access — which is critical for long-term point accumulation.

**Option 1: Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
- The nearest apple is at (2,5), requiring a path of at least 5 moves to reach.  
- You are at (6,6), and there’s no apple visible nearby.  
- Eating an apple would require moving to it, which is inefficient and risky — especially since the apple may not spawn until the river is clean.  
- Moreover, there’s no indication that apples are currently spawning — only that they *can*
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 8}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 3). You see dirt at (6, 3).
  Thinking: At (6, 3), I see dirt directly at my position — this means the river is currently dirty, and apples are not spawning. The nearest apple is at (2, 1), which is 6 steps away. However, apples only spawn when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt is necessary to enable future apple spawning. 

Right now, I cannot eat an apple because there are no apples available — the dirt prevents spawning. Eating an apple would be impossible, so option 1 is invalid. 

Option 2 — cleaning dirt — is the only viable action. Cleaning dirt has no immediate reward, but it is essential for enabling future apple spawns. Since apples are not currently spawning due to the dirty river, cleaning the dirt at (6, 3) is a prerequisite for any long-term progress. 

Even though there’s a distant apple at (2, 1), it will not spawn until the river is clean. Therefore, I must first clean the dirt to make future apple spawning possible. Without cleaning, the group will be unable to access apples at all.

There is no immediate benefit to moving toward (2, 1) without first cleaning the dirt. Moving toward it would only lead to wasted steps and no reward.

**Conclusion:**
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 3}} -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 7). You see agent 1 at (6, 6), dirt at (8, 7) and dirt at (6, 8).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to make the best decision as Agent 3.

Current position: (6, 7)  
Visible agents: Agent 1 at (6, 6)  
Dirt locations: (8, 7) and (6, 8)  
Nearest apple: (2, 5), distance = 6  
Nearest dirt: (6, 8), distance = 1  

First, evaluate the options:

1. **Eating an apple for immediate reward**  
   - Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is removed).  
   - The nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 units away — quite far.  
   - There are currently no apples visible in the immediate vicinity.  
   - Eating an apple would only be beneficial if one were available now.  
   → No apple is currently accessible. Therefore, **eating an apple is not feasible**.

2. **Cleaning dirt to enable future apple spawning**  
   - Dirt at (6, 8) is only 1 step away — very close.  
   - Dirt at (8, 7) is 2 steps away (to the east).  
   -

--- Step 50 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 7). You see dirt at (8, 7), dirt at (6, 8) and agent 3 at (6, 8).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to determine the best course of action.

Current position: (6, 7)  
Visible dirt: (8, 7) and (6, 8)  
Agent 3 is at (6, 8) — same location as the dirt  
Nearest apple: (2, 5), distance = 6  
Nearest dirt: (6, 8), distance = 1  

Key observations:
- There is no apple visible in immediate range. The nearest apple is 6 steps away, which is far.
- There is dirt directly at (6, 8) — just one step away — and agent 3 is already there. This suggests that cleaning this dirt would be a high-priority action to enable future apple spawning.
- Eating an apple now is not possible because no apple is in range. The apple at (2, 5) is too far to reach immediately.
- Cleaning dirt provides no immediate reward, but it enables future apple spawning — which benefits the group and increases long-term points.
- Since the dirt at (6, 8) is adjacent and agent 3 is already there, it's likely that agent 3 is already working on it or may be blocking access.
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 8}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 3). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation based on the rules and current state.

Currently, I am at (6, 3). The nearest apple is at (2, 1), which is 6 units away — a significant distance. There is no visible apple in immediate proximity, and I see nothing of interest nearby. The nearest dirt is at (6, 1), which is only 2 units away (directly below me at (6, 1)).

Now, let's evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward**:  
   There is no apple visible or accessible at this moment. The nearest apple is 6 steps away, and I don’t have any information about whether it's currently spawnable. According to the rules, apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned). Since the dirt at (6,1) is nearby and the river is not currently clean, apples are not spawning. Therefore, eating an apple is not possible right now — it would require the apple to be present, which it isn't.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning**:  
  Obs: You are at (11, 5). You see an apple at (13, 6).
  Thinking: Given the current situation:

- You are at (11, 5).
- There is an apple at (13, 6), which is 3 units away (a distance of 3 steps — 2 right, 1 up).
- The nearest dirt is **not found** in the global scan — this means there is no dirt currently available to clean.
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt has been cleaned). Since no dirt is visible, there is no immediate spawning of apples — the apple at (13, 6) is likely already present, not dependent on cleaning.

Let’s analyze the trade-offs:

1. **Eat the apple at (13, 6)?**  
   - Immediate reward: +1.0 point.  
   - This is a direct, tangible gain.  
   - However, if there is no dirt to clean, then cleaning is not currently a priority — there's no future apple spawning to enable.  
   - Since no dirt is present, there’s no need to clean *now* to enable future apples. So, eating the apple does not compromise future potential — it's safe.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apples?**
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 13, 'coord_y': 6}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (9, 0). You see agent 1 at (11, 0).
  Thinking: Let's analyze the situation carefully.

You are at (9, 0). Agent 1 is at (11, 0). The nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 4 units away — on the same horizontal line. That means you can reach it by moving east, one step at a time.

However, the global scan says: **"Nearest Dirt: None found."** This is critical. Dirt is required to spawn apples — apples only appear when the river is clean (i.e., when there is less dirt). So if there is *no dirt* currently in the environment, then apples cannot spawn at all, regardless of how far you go.

This implies that **apples are not currently available** — even if you move to (13, 0), there will be no apple there. The apple at (13, 0) might be a false indicator — perhaps it's not spawnable due to the absence of dirt.

Therefore:

- **Option 1 (eat an apple)**: Not viable. There are no apples currently available. Eating one would give +1.0, but no apple exists at (13, 0) or elsewhere. So immediate reward is zero.

--- Step 50 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (12, 0). You see an apple at (13, 0).
  Thinking: The current observation shows that there is an apple directly adjacent at (13, 0), just one step away — a very close and immediate opportunity to earn +1.0 points. There is no dirt in the global scan, meaning there is no current dirt to clean. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when there is dirt to be cleaned), and no dirt is present, cleaning is not currently beneficial or necessary.

Therefore, the trade-off analysis is:

1. **Eat the apple now?**  
   Yes — it provides immediate +1.0 reward. Since there's no dirt to clean (and thus no future apple spawning), there's no long-term benefit from cleaning. The apple is available now, and it's the only immediate source of points.

2. **Should you clean dirt?**  
   No — there is no dirt to clean. Without dirt, there’s nothing to clean, and thus no apples will spawn. Cleaning dirt is only useful when dirt is present, and it does not generate immediate reward. In this case, it’s a wasted action.

3. **Where should you explore?**  
   Since the only nearby apple is at (13, 0), and no dirt is visible,
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 13, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (12, 5). You see an apple at (13, 6).
  Thinking: Given the current situation:

- You are at (12, 5).
- There is an apple at (13, 6), which is only **one step east** and **one step north** — a distance of **√2**, but since you can't move diagonally, you must move **two separate steps** (e.g., (12,5) → (13,5) → (13,6)) to reach it.
- The nearest dirt is **not found in the global scan**, meaning there is no dirt visible or detectable nearby.
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — i.e., when dirt has been cleaned. Currently, since there is no dirt, no apples can spawn, even if you eat one.

### Key Observations:
- Eating the apple at (13,6) gives **+1.0 immediate reward**.
- However, since there is **no dirt nearby**, cleaning dirt is **not possible** — so the "future apple spawning" benefit is **not actionable** right now.
- The global scan says "Nearest Dirt: None found" — this implies that dirt is either far away or not in the current observable area. Thus, **clean
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 13, 'coord_y': 6}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (9, 1). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: Given the current observation and global scan, let's analyze the situation carefully.

You are at (9, 1).  
The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 4 units away — a reasonable distance, but not immediate.  
Crucially, the global scan states: **"Nearest Dirt: None found."** This is a critical detail.

This means:
- There is **no dirt** in the current environment to clean.
- Since apples **only spawn on land when the river is clean**, and there is currently **no dirt**, there is **no dirt to clean**, so **no apples can spawn** in the near future.
- Therefore, **the apple at (12, 2) is not currently spawnable** — it may be a phantom or a misplaced reference, or it may be unreachable due to lack of clean land.

But here's the key point: **Apples only spawn when the river is clean**, and cleaning dirt is required to enable apple spawning. Since there is **no dirt**, cleaning is not possible — and thus, **no apples will spawn regardless**.

So, the trade-off becomes:
1. **Eat an apple?** — But there is no apple visible or accessible in

Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 0). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 1 at (1, 1).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Here's the reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only 1 step away — this is a direct, low-effort opportunity for +1.0 points.
- The nearest dirt is at (6, 5), which is 9 steps away. Cleaning it would require significant movement and time, with no immediate benefit. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, this is a long-term strategy that doesn't provide any short-term reward or necessity right now.
- There is no immediate threat or obstruction from Agent 1 at (1, 1), and I can safely move to (1, 0) without risk. I can even move from (2, 0) to (1, 0) in one step (left), then eat the apple.
- The goal is to *maximize points*, and eating an apple gives a direct, tangible reward. Delaying this for a future benefit (cleaning dirt) would mean forgoing that immediate point, which is suboptimal in a situation where the apple is within reach.
- There's no indication that the dirt needs to be cleaned *now* — it's a future condition for future apple spawning. Since we don

Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (6, 5), dirt at (7, 5) and dirt at (7, 6).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 5), and my current observation shows dirt at (6, 5), (7, 5), and (7, 6). The global scan confirms that the nearest apple is at (13, 6), which is 7 units away — quite distant. The nearest dirt is at (7, 5), which is at distance 0, meaning I'm already standing on dirt.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There is no apple visible at my current position. The nearest apple is at (13, 6), which is 7 steps away. To reach it, I’d need to move through potentially dirty terrain. Since apples only spawn *when the river is clean* (i.e., when dirt is removed), and currently there is dirt at my position and adjacent cells, no apples are spawning. Therefore, I **cannot eat an apple immediately**. Attempting to eat one now would be impossible — it’s not available.

2. **Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning?**  
   This is critical. Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be removed. Right now, I’m standing on dirt at

--- Step 50 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (1, 1). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 2 at (2, 0).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only 1 step away — this gives me a direct +1.0 reward with no risk or cost.
- There is no immediate benefit to cleaning dirt at (6, 5), which is 9 steps away. Cleaning dirt takes time, effort, and offers no immediate reward, and since apples are not currently spawning (because the river isn’t clean), there’s no guaranteed future apple spawn to justify the delay.
- Agent 2 is at (2, 0), which is adjacent to the apple. If I don’t act now, agent 2 may eat the apple first, reducing my reward. Since I can move in cardinal directions (up, down, left, right) and no diagonal movement is allowed, I can reach the apple in one step.
- The global scan shows the nearest dirt is far away — there’s no urgent need to clean it right now. Future apple spawning depends on the river being clean, but that is not currently a threat or opportunity in the immediate environment.
- The trade-off between immediate reward and long-term group benefit is not favorable here: the immediate reward is available, and the long-term benefit (future apples
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 1, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 0). You see an apple at (1, 0) and agent 1 at (1, 1).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (1, 0).

Here's the reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only 1 step away — this is a direct, tangible reward (+1.0 point) with no risk or delay.
- The nearest dirt is at (6, 5), which is 9 steps away. Cleaning it would require significant movement and time, and there's no guarantee that it would spawn apples in the near term. Moreover, since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and we don’t know if the river is currently affected by dirt, this action would be speculative.
- Agent 1 is at (1, 1), which is adjacent to the apple at (1, 0). If I eat the apple, I gain a point and prevent agent 1 from potentially taking it. This gives me a slight advantage in competition for limited resources.
- There is no immediate benefit to cleaning dirt — it doesn't provide any points, and the apple spawning depends on future conditions that are not currently observable or predictable.
- Since I’m at (2, 0), I can move to (1, 0) in one step to eat the apple safely and efficiently.

Therefore, the immediate reward of eating the apple is
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 1, 'coord_y': 0}} -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 5). You see dirt at (6, 5) and dirt at (7, 6).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully and make a strategic decision based on the rules and current state.

Current position: (7, 5)  
Visible dirt: (6, 5) and (7, 6)  
Nearest apple: (13, 6), distance = 7  
Nearest dirt: (6, 5), distance = 1  

Key observations:
- There are **no apples currently visible** at my position or nearby. I’m at (7,5), and the only apple is far away at (13,6).
- The dirt at (6,5) is only 1 step away — very close.
- Cleaning dirt is required to enable apple spawning, but it gives **no immediate reward**.
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be removed from the area to allow apples to appear.
- Eating apples gives +1.0 points immediately, but there are no apples in range now.

So, the trade-off:
1. **Eat an apple?** → Not possible immediately. No apple is at (6,5), (7,6), or nearby. The nearest apple is 7 steps away. No apple is visible or reachable in a

  Obs: You are at (2, 0). You see an apple at (2, 1).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (2, 1).

Reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only 1 step away — this is the closest apple to me, and it provides a direct +1.0 reward with no risk or cost.
- The nearest dirt is at (7, 1), which is 6 steps away. Cleaning it would require significant movement and time, and there is no immediate benefit from doing so — apples only spawn when the river is clean, but we don’t know if that will lead to more apples or when. There's no guarantee of future rewards.
- Since apples spawn only when the river is clean, and we currently have an apple already, the immediate action of eating it gives a tangible, positive outcome with zero risk.
- The goal is to maximize points, and eating an apple directly increases score. Delaying this for future cleaning (which has uncertain and delayed returns) would be a suboptimal trade-off when a clear, immediate reward is available.

Therefore, the rational and goal-aligned choice is to eat the apple at (2, 1) now. After that, I can assess whether further exploration or cleaning is needed, but for now, immediate reward is the best action.
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 2, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 7). You see agent 1 at (6, 6), dirt at (7, 7), dirt at (8, 7), dirt at (6, 8) and dirt at (7, 8).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the current situation carefully to make the best decision as Agent 3.

**Current Position:** (6, 7)  
**Nearby Dirt:** (7, 7), (8, 7), (6, 8), (7, 8) — all within 1 step or adjacent  
**Nearest Apple:** (2, 5) — distance 6 (so far away)  
**Immediate Reward:** Eating an apple gives +1.0, but apples only spawn *when the river is clean* (i.e., when dirt is removed).  
**Rule:** Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (less dirt = more apples). So, cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning.  

**Key Insight:**  
- There are **no apples currently visible** near me. The nearest apple is at (2,5), which is 6 steps away.  
- The dirt is very close — just one step away at (7,7), (8,7), (6,8), (7,8).  
- **Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward**, but it enables future apple spawning — which benefits the group.  
- Eating an apple now would give a +1.

--- Step 50 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 6). You see dirt at (7, 7), agent 3 at (7, 7) and dirt at (8, 7).
  Thinking: I need to analyze the situation carefully and make a strategic decision based on the rules and current state.

Current position: (7, 6)  
Immediate surroundings:  
- Dirt at (7, 7) — occupied by agent 3  
- Dirt at (8, 7)  

Global scan:  
- Nearest apple is at (2, 5), which is 6 steps away — far and not immediately accessible.  
- Nearest dirt is at (7, 7), just 1 step away.  

Key points:  
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed).  
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but enables future apple spawning — crucial for long-term group benefit.  
- I cannot move diagonally, so movement is constrained to cardinal directions.  
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately — but apples are not currently spawning because dirt exists.  

Important realization:  
There is **no apple currently visible or accessible** in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is 6 steps away, and the path to it would require clearing dirt first (especially at (7,7) and (8,7)).  

But — if I clean dirt at
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 7, 'coord_y': 7}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (2, 1). You see an apple at (2, 1).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (2, 1).

Reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available at my current position (2, 1), with a distance of 0. This provides a direct +1.0 point reward with no risk or cost.
- There is no immediate benefit to cleaning dirt at (7, 1), which is 5 units away. The global scan shows that apples only spawn when the river is clean, but this is a future condition. Since no apples are currently spawning elsewhere, and we have a direct apple in hand, delaying action to clean dirt would mean missing out on a guaranteed point.
- The goal is to maximize points. Eating the apple now gives an immediate, verifiable reward. Cleaning dirt would require movement and time, and would only enable future apple spawns if and when the river becomes dirty again — which is not currently the case.
- There is no indication that cleaning dirt is urgent or that future apples depend on immediate action. Without a clear path to dirt or a need to improve river cleanliness, the optimal action is to take the available reward.

Therefore, eating the apple is the most efficient and reward-maximizing choice under current conditions.
  Decision: {'action': 'eat_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 2, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'eat'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (7, 7). You see agent 1 at (7, 6), dirt at (7, 7), dirt at (8, 7), dirt at (6, 8) and dirt at (7, 8).
  Thinking: I am at (7, 7), and the current observation shows that there is dirt at (7, 7), (8, 7), (6, 8), and (7, 8). The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 6 units away — a significant distance. Importantly, apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, meaning that dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning. Currently, there is dirt present, so no apples are available for consumption.

Let’s analyze the options:

1. **Eat an apple for immediate reward?**  
   There are no apples visible or accessible at this moment. The nearest apple is at (13, 7), which is 6 steps away, and there is no indication that any apple has spawned yet due to the presence of dirt. Eating an apple would require being on land with an apple — which currently doesn’t exist. So, this option is not viable.

2. **Clean dirt to ensure future apples spawn (helping the group)?**  
   This is a critical action. Dirt must be removed to enable apple spawning. The dirt at (7, 7) is directly adjacent to my current position. Cleaning it would be the

--- Step 1 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,5). Dirt at (7,6), (7,4).
  Thinking: At (5,5), I am not on any dirt, so I can't clean yet. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — currently, dirt is at (7,6) and (7,4), so the river is not clean, meaning no apples are available.  

I must move to a dirt cell to clean it. The closest dirt is at (7,6) or (7,4). Moving to (7,6) or (7,4) would allow me to clean it, which will help make the river cleaner and eventually enable apple spawning.  

**Action: move right to (6,5)** (closer to (7,6))  
Then eventually move down to (7,6) to clean it.  

**Reasoning:** Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning, even though it gives no points. Without cleaning, no apples appear. So prioritize cleaning dirt first.  

**Next step: move down to (7,6)** → **clean** → then evaluate.  

**Final action: down** (to reach (7,6))
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (9,7). Dirt at (7,8), (7,6).
  Thinking: At (9,7), you are not on any dirt, so you cannot clean it directly. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), but currently there is dirt at (7,8) and (7,6) — both not adjacent to you.

Since you can only clean dirt if you are on the same cell, and you are at (9,7), you must move to one of the dirt cells to clean them. However, cleaning dirt gives no points, but is necessary to enable apple spawning.

To maximize points, you should:
- Move to (7,8) or (7,6) to clean dirt.
- After cleaning, apples may spawn on land (assuming those cells become clean), and you can then eat apples.

But currently, no apples are present, and you are not on any dirt.

**Action: move left to (8,7)** (closer to (7,8))  
Then eventually move to (7,8) to clean it.

**Best next step: move left to (8,7)** → then to (7,7) → then to (7,8) to clean.

But since the goal is to maximize points, and
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (9,0). Dirt at (8,1), (8,0).
  Thinking: At (9,0), you are adjacent to dirt at (8,0) and (8,1). You cannot clean dirt unless you are on the same cell as it.

- You are **not on** (8,0) or (8,1), so you **cannot clean** dirt directly.
- There are **no apples** currently spawning, since apples only spawn when the river is clean — and the river is not clean yet (dirt exists).
- Therefore, **you cannot eat an apple**.

**Best action: Move to (8,0)** to clean the dirt there.

**Reasoning**: Cleaning dirt is necessary to make the river clean and enable apple spawning. Since you can only clean dirt when on the same cell, moving to (8,0) allows you to clean it. After cleaning, you can potentially clean (8,1) next, and eventually enable apple spawning.

--- Step 2 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,4). Dirt at (7,4).
  Thinking: At (5,4), there is no apple visible, and the dirt is at (7,4), which is to the right of your current position. You cannot clean dirt or eat apples unless you are on the same cell as them.

Action: **right**  
Reason: Move to (6,4) to get closer to the dirt at (7,4). From there, you can clean it if you reach (7,4). Cleaning dirt doesn't give points, but it enables apple spawning on land — so it's necessary to eventually eat apples.  

Next step: After cleaning dirt at (7,4), check if apples spawn (likely on land cells adjacent to clean areas). Then, move to eat apples.  

**Current best action: right**.
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,7). Dirt at (6,8), (7,8), (7,6).
  Thinking: At (8,7), you are not on any dirt cells. Dirt is at (6,8), (7,8), (7,6) — all of which are not adjacent to your current position.

To eat apples, the river must be clean (i.e., dirt must be removed). But apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — so cleaning dirt is necessary but doesn’t give points.

Since you are at (8,7), you can only clean dirt if you move to a cell with dirt. The nearest dirt cells are:

- (7,8): up-left from (8,7)
- (7,6): down-left from (8,7)

You can move to (7,8) or (7,6) to clean dirt.

But cleaning dirt gives no points — only eating apples does (+1.0 each).

Currently, there are no apples visible, and apples only spawn when dirt is cleaned (and river is clean). So, to get apples, you must first clean the dirt.

**Best action: move to (7,8) to clean dirt.**

Reasoning: Cleaning dirt is required to enable apple spawning. Since no apples are currently available, and you can’t eat anything now,
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Dirt at (8,1), (6,0), (8,0).
  Thinking: At (8,0):  
- You are on a cell with dirt.  
- Dirt is at (8,0), (8,1), and (6,0).  

Available actions:  
- You can **clean** dirt only if you are on a cell with dirt.  
- Cleaning dirt does **not** give points, but it enables apples to spawn *later* when the river is clean.  
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — so cleaning is necessary to enable apple spawning.  

Current situation:  
- You are at (8,0), which has dirt.  
- You can **clean** this dirt immediately.  
- Cleaning (8,0) will reduce dirt there, helping to make the area "cleaner" for apple spawning.  

**Action: clean**  
→ Reason: Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apples to spawn. Since apples give +1.0 points and cleaning doesn't cost points, it's optimal to clean dirt first.  

After cleaning (8,0), dirt is gone from that cell. You can then move or clean other dirt cells if needed.

--- Step 3 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,4). Dirt at (8,5), (7,4).
  Thinking: At (6,4), you can see dirt at (8,5) and (7,4). You are not on any dirt, so you cannot clean yet.  

To eat an apple, the river must be clean — meaning there must be no dirt. Since dirt exists at (8,5) and (7,4), apples are not currently spawning.  

You must clean dirt to enable apple spawning. The closest dirt is at (7,4) — directly to the right of you.  

**Action: right** → move to (7,4)  
Then **clean** → remove dirt at (7,4)  

Now, with one dirt cleaned, the river is slightly cleaner. You can then move to (8,5) to clean that dirt if needed.  

After cleaning all dirt, apples may spawn on land. But since apples only spawn *when the river is clean*, and you're at (6,4), you must ensure no dirt remains.  

**Best next step: move to (7,4), clean it.**  

→ **Action: right, then clean**  

This is necessary to enable apple spawning. Eating apples comes later, after cleaning.  

**Final reasoning: Clean dirt at (7
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,7). Dirt at (6,8), (7,8), (7,6).
  Thinking: At (7,7), I see dirt at (6,8), (7,8), and (7,6). I am not on any dirt cells, so I cannot clean yet. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning I need to clean dirt to make land available for apples.

Since I can only clean dirt if I'm on a cell with dirt, and I’m currently at (7,7), I must move to a dirt cell to clean it.

Dirt is at:
- (6,8) → up-left from (7,7)
- (7,8) → up from (7,7)
- (7,6) → down from (7,7)

I can move to any of these to clean.

Let’s evaluate:
- (7,8): directly up — easy to reach.
- (7,6): directly down — also easy.
- (6,8): diagonal — requires two moves (up then left), less efficient.

Best to pick one. Let’s go to (7,8) first — it's adjacent and accessible.

**Action: up** → move to (7,8)

Now I'm on (7,8), which has dirt. I
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Dirt at (8,1), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (8,0), you can see dirt at (8,1) and (6,0).  

- You **cannot eat** an apple because there's no apple visible at your position.  
- You **can clean** dirt if you are on the same cell.  
  - You are at (8,0), so you can **clean (8,0)** — but there's no dirt at (8,0), only at (8,1) and (6,0).  
  - Therefore, **cleaning is not possible** at your current position.  
- To access dirt at (8,1), you need to **move up** to (8,1) to clean it.  
- Dirt at (6,0) is not reachable from (8,0) without moving left or down, but (6,0) is not adjacent to (8,0) — you'd need to go left twice (to (7,0), then (6,0)).

So, the best action:  
👉 **Move up to (8,1)** to clean the dirt there.  

Why?  
- Cleaning dirt is necessary to make the river clean, which enables apple spawning.  
- Apples

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,4). Dirt at (8,5), (7,4).
  Thinking: At (7,4), you are on a cell that has dirt. You can **clean** this dirt (it gives no points but is necessary).  

There's also dirt at (8,5), which is not currently accessible.  

Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning, dirt must be cleaned to allow apple spawning. Since you're at (7,4) and there's dirt here, **cleaning it first** is necessary.  

**Action: clean**  
→ This removes dirt from (7,4), helping make the area cleaner and potentially enabling apple spawning in the future.  

You cannot eat yet — no apple is present at (7,4) currently.  

**Next step**: After cleaning (7,4), assess if you can move to other dirt cells (like (8,5)) to clean them, or if apples have now appeared.  

**Reasoning**: Cleaning dirt is required to enable apple spawning. Eating apples gives points, but only when land is clean. So, prioritize cleaning dirt at your position.  

✅ Action: **clean**
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,7). Dirt at (6,8), (7,8), (7,6).
  Thinking: At (7,7), there is no apple currently. The dirt is at (6,8), (7,8), and (7,6) — all of which are adjacent or nearby, but not directly at (7,7).  

To spawn apples, the river must be clean (i.e., dirt must be removed). Since we can only clean dirt **on our current cell**, we must move to a cell that has dirt to clean.  

Current dirt locations:  
- (6,8): above-left  
- (7,8): above  
- (7,6): below  

We are at (7,7).  
- (7,8) is directly above → can clean it  
- (7,6) is directly below → can clean it  
- (6,8) is diagonal → cannot clean from (7,7)  

So, we can clean either (7,8) or (7,6).  

But cleaning dirt gives **no points**, only enables apple spawning. So we must clean to enable apples to spawn *somewhere* — but apples only spawn on land when the river is clean.  

Since we are at (7,7), and the only dirt on adjacent cells is (7
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (7,2), (8,1), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (8,1), you are on a cell with dirt. There's also dirt at (7,2) and (6,0).  

Action analysis:  
- You **cannot eat** an apple here yet because there's no apple spawned. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — i.e., when there's no dirt.  
- You **can clean** the dirt at (8,1) since you're on that cell. Cleaning it will remove dirt and potentially enable apple spawning on land.  

**Best action: clean**  
→ Removing dirt at (8,1) helps make the area cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn on adjacent land cells.  

After cleaning, you can then evaluate whether to move to other dirt cells or check for apple spawns.  

**Reasoning**: Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning, and since apples give +1.0 points, you must first clean to enable the possibility of eating.

--- Step 5 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,4). Dirt at (8,5).
  Thinking: You are at (7,4). Dirt is at (8,5).  

To clean dirt, you must be on the same cell as the dirt. You are not currently on (8,5), so you cannot clean it directly.  

Action options:  
- Move to (8,5) to clean the dirt.  
- Clean only if on the dirt cell.  
- Eat apples only if on a cell with an apple (which requires the river to be clean, i.e., less dirt).  

Currently, there are no apples mentioned, and the river is not clean (since there's dirt). So, no apples can be eaten yet.  

**Best action: move right to (8,5) to clean the dirt.**  

After cleaning, the river will be cleaner, which may enable apple spawning. Then, you can move to a cell with an apple (if any) to eat it.  

✅ Action: **right** (to move to (8,5))
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,7). Dirt at (6,8), (7,8), (7,6).
  Thinking: At (7,7), there is no apple currently. The dirt is at (6,8), (7,8), and (7,6) — all of which are adjacent to (7,7), so I can reach them.

To spawn apples, the river must be clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. Cleaning dirt gives no points, but it enables apples to spawn later. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, I must clean the dirt first.

Available dirt cells:
- (6,8): adjacent (up-left)
- (7,8): adjacent (up)
- (7,6): adjacent (down)

I can clean any of these. Let's pick one — say, (7,8) — since it's directly above me.

**Action: up** → move to (6,8)  
**Action: clean** → clean dirt at (6,8)

Now, (6,8) is clean. I can return to (7,7) and check if apples have spawned. But apples only spawn *after* dirt is cleaned and on land cells — not immediately.

However, I can only eat apples if I'm on a cell with an apple. Since apples spawn only when the
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (7,2), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (8,1), you are not on any dirt, so you cannot clean. There's no apple visible at your position. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — currently, dirt is at (7,2) and (6,0), so the river is not clean yet, meaning no apples are present.

To enable apples to spawn, you must clean dirt. But you can only clean dirt if you are on the same cell as the dirt. You are at (8,1), not on (7,2) or (6,0). So you must move to one of those dirt cells to clean.

Best action: **move left to (7,1)** — closer to (7,2). Then you can eventually clean (7,2). After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn on land. Then you can move to eat apples.

But currently: **no apples, no dirt to clean at current position.**

Action: **left** (to get closer to dirt at (7,2)).

--- Step 6 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,4). Dirt at (8,5).
  Thinking: At (8,4), there is no apple available. Dirt is at (8,5), which is directly below you. Since you can only clean dirt when you are on the same cell, you cannot clean (8,5) from (8,4).  

To clean dirt, you must move to (8,5) first. After cleaning it, the river will be cleaner, potentially enabling apple spawning. However, cleaning dirt gives no points.  

**Action: move down to (8,5)**  
→ Then clean the dirt.  
→ After cleaning, if apples spawn, you can later eat them.  

**Reasoning:** You must first reach the dirt to clean it. Without cleaning, apples won't spawn (since apples only appear when the river is clean). Cleaning is necessary but pointless; it enables future apple eating.  

**Next step: down**
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,7). Dirt at (6,8), (7,8), (6,7), (7,6).
  Thinking: At (7,7), I see dirt at (6,8), (7,8), (6,7), and (7,6) — all adjacent cells. Since I can only clean dirt **on my current cell**, and none of the dirt is at (7,7), I **cannot clean any dirt right now**.

Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — but since I'm not on a dirt cell, I can't clean it, and there's no apple visible at (7,7). Therefore, I **cannot eat an apple**.

**Best action: stay** — because I can't move to clean dirt or eat apples from current position. Cleaning is not possible, and eating is not possible.

**Reasoning**: No dirt at (7,7), so no clean action. No apple present. Must stay to assess future moves.

✅ Action: **stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Dirt at (7,2), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (7,1), you are not on any dirt, so you cannot clean. There's no apple visible at your position.  

Dirt is at (7,2) and (6,0) — both are not adjacent to you currently. To clean dirt, you must move to a cell with dirt.  

**Best action: move down to (7,0)** — not directly helpful.  
**Better: move up to (6,1)** — still not on dirt.  
**Best: move right to (7,2)** — now you are on dirt at (7,2).  

✅ **Action: right** → move to (7,2)  
Now you can **clean** the dirt at (7,2).  

Cleaning dirt doesn't give points, but it enables apples to spawn (since the river is now cleaner).  

After cleaning (7,2), the river is cleaner → apples may spawn on land. But you must stay on land to eat them.  

Currently, only (7,2) and (6,0) have dirt. After cleaning (7,2), the river is cleaner, so apples might appear on land cells — but we don't know which.

--- Step 7 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,3). Dirt at (7,2).
  Thinking: At (8,3), you are not on any dirt, so you cannot clean it. Dirt is at (7,2), which is not adjacent to your position. You cannot eat an apple because there is no apple spawn mentioned, and apples only spawn when the river is clean—meaning dirt must be cleaned. Since you can't reach (7,2) to clean it, no apples can spawn.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: You cannot clean dirt or eat apples from your current position. Moving would not help without access to dirt. Staying is safest and allows you to potentially move closer if more info is given.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,7). Dirt at (6,8), (7,8), (6,7), (7,6).
  Thinking: At (7,7), I can see dirt at (6,8), (7,8), (6,7), and (7,6) — all adjacent cells. Since I can only clean or eat items **at my current position**, and there's no dirt at (7,7), I **cannot clean** dirt here.

There are no apples mentioned at (7,7), so I **cannot eat** an apple either.

**Action: stay**  
Reasoning: I am not on any dirt, so I can't clean. There's no apple at my position. Staying is safe and avoids unnecessary movement. Apple spawning depends on the river being clean, but since I can't clean dirt from elsewhere, I can't affect apple spawning directly. I must first clean dirt to enable apple spawning. However, I can only clean dirt when I'm on a cell with dirt. So, I must move to a dirt cell to clean it.

**Next step**: Move to a dirt cell (e.g., (6,7)) to clean it. Then, after cleaning, check if apples can spawn (river becomes clean), and if so, eat them.

But current action: **stay**.  
→ Reason: No action benefits me
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (7,2), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (8,1), you are not on any dirt, so you can't clean yet. There's dirt at (7,2) and (6,0), but you can only clean dirt if you're on the same cell.  

Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. Since you're not on any dirt, you can't clean it directly.  

To clean dirt, you must move to a cell with dirt. The closest dirt is at (7,2) — you need to move there.  

**Action: move left to (7,1)** → then move up to (7,2) to clean dirt.  

After cleaning (7,2), the river becomes cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn. Then you can move to a land cell to eat apples.  

**Reasoning**: Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apples, and you can only clean what you're on. Move to dirt to clean it, then proceed to eat apples.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,3). Dirt at (7,2).
  Thinking: At (8,3), you are not on any dirt, so you cannot clean it. Dirt is at (7,2), which is not adjacent to your current position. To clean dirt, you must move to (7,2) first. However, cleaning dirt gives no points, but it's necessary to enable apple spawning on land — which requires the river to be clean.

Since there are no apples visible and you're not on dirt, you cannot eat or clean right now. The best action is to **move to (7,2)** to clean the dirt.

**Action: left** (to move from (8,3) to (7,3)), then possibly down or left further to reach (7,2). But since only one action is allowed, the best immediate move is:

**left** — to get closer to the dirt at (7,2).  

(Reasoning: Without cleaning dirt, apples won’t spawn. You must reach the dirt to clean it, which enables future apple spawning. Eating apples is only possible after the river is clean.)
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,7). Dirt at (6,8), (7,8), (6,7), (7,6).
  Thinking: At (7,7), I see dirt at (6,8), (7,8), (6,7), and (7,6) — all adjacent to me. Since I can only clean dirt *at my position*, and I'm not on any of those dirt cells, I cannot clean them directly.

There is no apple at (7,7) currently, and apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Since I can't clean dirt from my current position, I can't make the river clean, so no apples will spawn.

Available actions:
- **Move** to a neighboring cell (up, down, left, right) to get closer to dirt or possibly spawn apples.
- **Stay** — no benefit.
- **Clean** — only possible if on a dirt cell. I’m not on any dirt.
- **Eat** — only possible if an apple is present. None are.

So, I must **move** to a position where I can eventually clean dirt or reach a spot where apples might spawn.

Best next step: **Move to (7,8)** — that’s adjacent to dirt at (7,8). From there, I can clean it (if I move to that cell). Then, cleaning will

Dirt is at (7,2) and (6,0) — both are not adjacent to you. To clean dirt, you must be on the same cell as the dirt.  

Currently, no apples are spawning because the river isn’t clean. To enable apple spawning, you must clean dirt.  

**Best action: move to (7,2) to clean the dirt there.**  
After cleaning (7,2), the river becomes cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn later.  

→ **Action: right** (to move to (7,2))  

Reasoning: Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning. Without cleaning, no apples can appear. You must act to clean first.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,3). Dirt at (7,2).
  Thinking: At (7,3), there is dirt at (7,2), which is directly below you. Since you can only clean dirt if you are on the same cell, you cannot clean the dirt at (7,2) from (7,3). 

There are no apples mentioned at your current position, so you cannot eat one yet. 

**Best action: move down to (7,2)** to clean the dirt there.  
Cleaning dirt gives no points, but it's necessary to improve the river's cleanliness and enable future apple spawning.  

**Action: down**.
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,7). Dirt at (6,8), (7,8), (6,7), (7,6). Apple at (10,7).
  Thinking: At (8,7), you are not on an apple, so you can't eat one yet.  
There is dirt at (6,8), (7,8), (6,7), (7,6) — all of which are not adjacent to your current position.  
You can only clean dirt if you are on the same cell as the dirt.  

Currently, you are at (8,7), which is adjacent to (7,7) and (9,7), but none of the dirt cells are directly adjacent.  

So:  
- You **cannot clean any dirt** from your current position.  
- You **cannot eat the apple at (10,7)** because it's not on your cell.  

Best action: **move toward the apple at (10,7)** to get closer.  

→ **Right** to (9,7)  

Reasoning: The apple is at (10,7), and to reach it, you need to move right. Cleaning dirt is not possible now, and eating is not possible. Moving toward the apple is the only viable step.  

**Action: right**
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (7,2), (6,0).

Dirt is at (7,2) and (6,0) — both are not adjacent to you. So you can't clean them directly.  

Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — but since you're not on dirt and can't reach the dirt cells directly, you can't clean them, so no apples will spawn.  

Best action: **stay** — you can't move to clean dirt or eat an apple. Any movement would not help.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Dirt at (7,2). Agent 3 at (8,1).
  Thinking: At (7,2), there is dirt, and you can clean it. Cleaning dirt gives no points directly, but it's necessary to enable apples to spawn on land. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt), cleaning the dirt at (7,2) will help create conditions for apples to appear.

Agent 3 is at (8,1), but there's no indication they are blocking or affecting your actions. You cannot eat an apple unless one is present, and currently, there's no apple mentioned.

**Action: clean**  
Reason: Cleaning the dirt at (7,2) is necessary to enable apple spawning. Eating is not possible yet, as there's no apple. Staying or moving without cleaning won't help — cleaning is the only beneficial action available now.
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (9,7). Dirt at (7,8), (7,6). Apple at (10,7).
  Thinking: At (9,7):  
- There's an apple at (10,7) — you can only eat it if you move to (10,7).  
- Dirt is at (7,8) and (7,6) — not at your current position, so you can't clean them yet.  
- You are currently at (9,7), which is not on a dirt cell, so you can't clean anything here.  
- You can move to (10,7) to eat the apple (+1.0 point).  

**Action: right** → move to (10,7)  
**Then: eat** → consume the apple (+1.0 point)

✅ Reasoning: The apple is adjacent and reachable. Dirt is not at current position, so no cleaning needed. Eating the apple gives points and is the only actionable goal.  

**Final action: right, then eat**.
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (7,2), (6,0). Agent 1 at (7,2).
  Thinking: At (8,1), you see dirt at (7,2) and (6,0). Agent 1 is at (7,2), which is a dirt cell. You cannot clean dirt unless you are on the same cell.  

Right now, you are at (8,1), not on any dirt. So you cannot clean dirt directly.  

Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. Since you can't clean dirt from (7,2) or (6,0) unless you move there, you must first move to one of those cells to clean.  

However, you cannot eat apples unless they are present, and apples only spawn when dirt is cleaned. So cleaning is necessary first.  

Best action: **move left to (7,1)** (adjacent to (7,2)) — but that doesn't clean dirt.  

To clean (7,2), you must be on (7,2). So you need to move there.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Agent 3 at (7,1).
  Thinking: At (7,2), I am not on a dirt cell, and there's no apple visible. Agent 3 is at (7,1), directly above me. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and I can only clean dirt at my current position, I must first check if I'm on dirt.

Currently, I'm at (7,2). If this cell is dirt, I can clean it — but cleaning dirt gives no points, only enables apple spawning. If it's land, I might be able to eat an apple.

No information confirms whether (7,2) is dirt or land. However, since there's no apple visible and Agent 3 is at (7,1), it's possible the area is still dirty.

**Action: stay**  
→ I stay at (7,2) to assess the situation. If I can't eat or clean, I need to move to check surroundings. But without knowing if (7,2) is dirt or land, I cannot act confidently.

**Best next step: stay** (to monitor the environment and possibly detect if dirt is present or if an apple spawns after cleaning).

Since you are on the same cell as the apple, you can eat it.  

Action: **eat**  
Reason: Eating the apple gives +1.0 point. No dirt needs to be cleaned here because the apple is already present. Eating is directly possible and maximizes points.

  Obs: You at (7,1). Dirt at (6,0). Agent 1 at (7,2).
  Thinking: At (7,1), there is no apple currently. Dirt is at (6,0), which is not adjacent to you. Since you can only clean dirt or eat apples *at your current position*, and there's no dirt at (7,1), you cannot clean anything here. There's also no apple at (7,1), so you can't eat.

**Best action: stay**  
Reasoning: Moving would not help, as there's no dirt to clean or apple to eat nearby. Staying allows you to monitor the situation. If dirt appears or apples spawn later (which depends on river cleanliness), you might need to move. But currently, no action yields points.

  Obs: You at (7,2). Agent 3 at (7,1).
  Thinking: At (7,2), I am not on a dirt cell, and there's no visible apple. Agent 3 is at (7,1), directly above me. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points, I must first determine if there's dirt to clean nearby.

Currently, I'm at (7,2). If there's dirt at (7,2), I could clean it — but cleaning gives no points. If there's an apple, I could eat it — but only if it's present and the river is clean.

No information is given about dirt or apples at (7,2). Since I can’t eat without an apple, and I can’t clean without dirt, and there’s no indication of apple presence, I should **stay** to assess the situation.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: No apple visible, no dirt confirmed, and I need to determine if cleaning dirt (to enable apple spawning) is needed before eating. Staying allows monitoring the environment.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (10,7). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (10,7), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately.  

**Reasoning**:  
- To eat apples, there must be an apple on the grid, which only spawns when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned).  
- You can only clean dirt or eat apples *on your current cell*.  
- Since nothing is visible, your cell may be empty (no dirt, no apple).  

**Action**:  
→ **stay** (to remain in position and assess if anything changes or if you need to move to detect dirt or apples).  

If you stay and nothing changes, you may need to explore nearby cells. But with no visible info, staying is the safest and most logical first step.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Dirt at (6,0). Agent 1 at (7,2).
  Thinking: At (7,1), there is no apple visible, and the dirt is at (6,0), which is not adjacent to you. To spawn apples, the river must be clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. Since dirt is at (6,0), you need to move there to clean it.

Current position: (7,1)  
Dirt at: (6,0)  
Agent 1 at: (7,2) — irrelevant unless interacting, but no rules mention agents affecting apples or dirt.

Best action: Move to (6,0) to clean the dirt.

**Action: left, down, left** → (6,1) → (6,0)

Then: **clean** at (6,0)

After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner → apples may now spawn on land nearby.

Only after cleaning can apples appear. Then, if apples spawn, you can eat them.

**Final reasoning**: You must move to the dirt at (6,0) to clean it (no points from cleaning, but necessary). After cleaning, apples may spawn on land, allowing you to earn points by eating them.  

**Immediate action: move left to (6,1), then down to (6,0), then

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Agent 3 at (6,1).
  Thinking: At (7,2), I am on land. I need to check if there's an apple to eat or if I should clean dirt to enable more apples.

- There's no mention of dirt at (7,2), so I can’t clean unless dirt is present.  
- Agent 3 is at (6,1), which is not relevant unless there's interaction (but no rules mention agent interference).  

Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and I have no dirt to clean here, there's no apple to eat.  

Action: **stay** — I remain at (7,2) to monitor the environment. If dirt appears or if I can move to a location with dirt, I can clean it.  

No immediate gain, so best to stay and assess.  

✅ Reasoning: No dirt to clean, no apple visible. Stay to wait for opportunity.  

**Action: stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (10,7). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (10,7), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately.  

**Reasoning:**  
- To eat apples, there must be an apple on the cell you're on — currently, there isn't one.  
- To clean dirt, you must be on a cell with dirt — no dirt is visible.  
- Since nothing is visible, it's likely the area is clean or empty.  

**Action: stay**  
→ Wait to assess if anything appears (e.g., dirt or apples) in the next update. Moving without information may lead to wasted steps.  

**Next step:** Monitor the environment for changes. If dirt appears, clean it to enable apple spawning. If apples appear, eat them.  

**Final action: stay** ✅
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,1). Dirt at (6,0). Agent 1 at (7,2).
  Thinking: At (6,1), there is dirt at (6,0) directly below you. You can **clean** the dirt at (6,0) since you are on (6,1) and can only act on items in your current cell or adjacent cells — but cleaning dirt requires being on the cell with dirt. Since you are at (6,1) and dirt is at (6,0), you cannot clean it directly unless you move there.

So:  
- You **cannot clean** (6,0) from (6,1).  
- There is no apple at (6,1) mentioned.  
- Agent 1 is at (7,2), irrelevant to your current action.  

**Best action: Move down to (6,0) to clean the dirt.**  
Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning on land (which happens when river is clean), so this is essential.  

✅ Action: **down**  
Then, once at (6,0), you can **clean**.  

After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn on adjacent land cells — potentially enabling future apple eating.  

**Reasoning:** Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning, and you are currently

--- Step 14 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,2), with nothing in view, I need to check what's around me. Since I can only act on what's directly at my position, and there's no visible item, I should first investigate whether there's dirt to clean or an apple to eat.

But the rules say:  
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean.  
- Cleaning dirt gives no points, but enables apple spawning.  
- I can only clean or eat if I'm on a cell with dirt or an apple.

Since nothing is visible, it's possible I'm on a cell with dirt (which I can clean) or possibly on land with no apple yet (since apples require clean river).

Action: **clean** — to check if there's dirt. This is necessary to enable apple spawning later.  

**Reasoning**: Without knowing the state of the cell, I cannot eat an apple. Cleaning dirt is required to allow apples to spawn, and since I'm at (7,2) with nothing visible, it's safest to assume the cell might have dirt. Cleaning it is a necessary first step to enable future apple harvesting.  

👉 Action: **clean**
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (10,7). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (10,7), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apples to spawn, the river must be clean—meaning dirt must be cleaned. However, cleaning dirt gives no points, so it's only a prerequisite.

Without knowing the state of the surrounding cells (dirt or apples), you cannot act optimally. Since nothing is visible, it's safest to **move** to explore and check for dirt or apples. 

**Action: left**  
(Exploring adjacent cells to find dirt to clean and potentially apples. This is a necessary step before eating.)
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Dirt at (6,0).
  Thinking: You are at (6,0), and there is dirt at your position.  

Action: **clean**  
Reason: You can only eat apples when there's clean land, and apples spawn on clean land. Since dirt is currently at your position, you must clean it first to enable apple spawning. Cleaning dirt gives no points directly, but it's necessary to enable future apple collection.  

After cleaning, you can then assess whether apples have appeared and decide whether to eat them.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,2), with nothing in view, I need to check what's around me. Since I can only clean dirt or eat apples *if* they are on my current cell, and there's nothing visible, I must first explore.

Action: **right**  
Reason: Moving right may reveal dirt or apples. Without any visible items, exploration is necessary to find dirt (to clean) or apples (to eat). Cleaning dirt enables apples to spawn later, so it's essential to begin cleaning where possible.  

Next step: Explore and find dirt or apples.
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (9,7). Dirt at (7,8), (7,7), (7,6).
  Thinking: At (9,7), you are not on any dirt. The dirt is at (7,8), (7,7), (7,6) — all to the left and above. You cannot clean dirt unless you are on the same cell as it.

Since there are no apples mentioned, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, you must first move to a dirt cell to clean it.

Best action: **move left** to (8,7), then possibly to (7,7) to clean dirt.

But currently, you are at (9,7). The closest dirt is at (7,7), which is two cells left.

So, first: **left** → (8,7), then **left** → (7,7). Then **clean**.

Only after cleaning dirt can apples potentially spawn. Then you can eat apples.

But currently: **no apples available**, and you can't eat or clean from current position.

✅ Reasoning: You must move to a dirt cell to clean it. Cleaning dirt enables apple spawning. Since you can't eat or clean now, the best next step is to **move left to (

  Thinking: At (6,0), nothing is visible. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first check if there's dirt to clean. Without any visible items, I cannot eat an apple.  

Action: **stay**  
Reason: I need to assess the environment further. Without knowing if there's dirt or apples nearby, I cannot proceed. Staying allows me to remain in a position where I can detect changes or receive updates. If dirt is present, I can clean it to enable apple spawning. If not, I may need to explore.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,2), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and you can only eat or clean what's directly at your position, you must first check if there's dirt to clean or an apple to eat.

But since nothing is visible, it's likely that your current cell is either empty or has no apple or dirt. Without confirmation, you cannot perform a clean or eat action.

Best action: **stay**  
→ To remain in position and assess the environment further (maybe future updates will reveal dirt or apples).  

No point in moving yet — no information to act on.  

**Action: stay** ✅
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,7). Dirt at (6,8), (7,8), (6,7), (7,7), (7,6).
  Thinking: At (8,7), you are not on any dirt. The dirt is at (6,8), (7,8), (6,7), (7,7), (7,6) — all to the left and above.  

To spawn apples, the river must be clean (i.e., dirt must be cleaned). But cleaning dirt gives no points — only eating apples gives +1.0 each.  

Since you are at (8,7), you can only clean dirt if you move to a cell with dirt.  

Best move: **move left to (7,7)** — that cell has dirt. Clean it.  

After cleaning (7,7), you can continue cleaning adjacent dirt cells to clean the river.  

But: **cleaning gives no points**, so you must first clean to enable apple spawning.  

Once all dirt is cleaned, apples may spawn on land — but currently, there’s no indication of apple locations. Apples only spawn *when the river is clean*.  

So, your priority is: **clean dirt to make apples possible**.  

Action: **left** → move to (7,7), then **clean**.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: Without any visible items, I cannot clean dirt or eat apples. Staying allows me to assess the environment further. If something appears later, I can act. Moving now risks missing critical information.  

**Next step:** Wait and observe (if possible). But given the current state, the safest action is to **stay**.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,2), nothing is visible. Since there are no apples or dirt in sight, I cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apple spawning, I need to clean dirt, but without knowing if there's dirt at my position, I can't act.

First, I should **check** my current cell: is there dirt? If yes, I can clean it. If no, I may need to explore.

Since nothing is visible, I must **assume** there's no apple or dirt currently. But to be safe and follow the rules, I should **stay** and check my position.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: I need to confirm if there's dirt or an apple at (8,2) before acting. Without visibility, I can't proceed with clean or eat. Staying allows me to assess the current state.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,7). Dirt at (6,8), (7,8), (6,7), (7,7), (7,6).
  Thinking: At (7,7), there is dirt on your cell (7,7), so you can **clean** it. Cleaning dirt doesn't give points, but it's necessary to enable apple spawning. After cleaning (7,7), the dirt is removed, and now the river is cleaner in that area.

Currently, apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Since cleaning (7,7) improves the river's cleanliness, this may allow apples to appear on adjacent land cells — but only if those cells are currently land and not dirt.

However, there are no apples mentioned yet, and no apple spawning is confirmed. Since you're at (7,7), and you can only eat or clean what's directly on your cell, the best immediate action is:

👉 **Clean** (7,7)

Reasoning: Cleaning is necessary to enable future apple spawning. Eating is not possible now because there's no apple on your cell. Cleaning dirt at (7,7) is required to improve the river's condition and potentially allow apples to spawn in nearby areas later.

**Action: clean**
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately.

- To eat apples, there must be an apple on the ground, which only spawns when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned).  
- You can only clean dirt or eat apples *if you are on a cell with dirt or an apple*.  
- With nothing visible, it's likely the current cell is clean or empty.  

**Best action:** *clean* — to check if there’s dirt to clean, which may enable future apple spawning.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,2), nothing is visible. Since there are no apples or dirt visible, I cannot eat or clean immediately. To progress, I must first explore the area to find dirt (to clean) or apples (to eat).  

Action: **left**  
Reason: Moving left may reveal nearby terrain (e.g., dirt or apples). Without any visible items, exploration is essential to begin cleaning and eventually eating apples.
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,7). Dirt at (6,8), (7,8), (6,7), (7,6).
  Thinking: At (7,7), I see dirt at (6,8), (7,8), (6,7), and (7,6) — all adjacent to me. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and I can only clean dirt *at my position*, I must first clean dirt that is *on my cell* to enable apple spawning.

However, none of the dirt is directly at (7,7). The dirt is at (6,8), (7,8), (6,7), and (7,6) — all adjacent cells. I cannot clean those from here. Therefore, I **cannot clean any dirt** at my current position.

Since there's no dirt at (7,7), I can't clean anything, and thus no apples can spawn. There's no apple available to eat either.

**Action: stay**  
I stay at (7,7) — no dirt to clean, no apples to eat. No points gained.  

**Reasoning:** I am not on any dirt cell, so I can't clean. Apples only spawn when the river is clean (dirt is removed), but I can't clean dirt outside my current cell
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apples to spawn, the river must be clean—meaning dirt must be cleaned. However, cleaning dirt gives no points, only enables apple spawning.

Since you are at (6,0) and see nothing, it's likely that dirt is not visible or not present. Without dirt to clean, apples won’t spawn. Therefore, to maximize points, you must first **move to a location with dirt** to clean it, which will eventually allow apples to spawn.

**Action: left** (to explore and find dirt)  
→ Reason: You need to find dirt to clean it, which enables apple spawning. Without cleaning, no apples can appear. Moving left is a logical first step to explore the grid.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,2), nothing is visible. Since there are no apples or dirt visible, I cannot eat or clean immediately.  

First, I need to explore the surroundings to find dirt (to clean) or apples (to eat).  

Action: **right**  
Reason: Moving right may reveal dirt or apples. Without any information, exploration is necessary to begin cleaning and eventually eating apples.  

Next step: explore to find dirt or apples.
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,7). Dirt at (6,8), (7,8), (6,7), (7,6).
  Thinking: At (7,7), I see dirt at (6,8), (7,8), (6,7), and (7,6). These are all adjacent cells, but I'm not on any of them.  

To spawn apples, the river must be clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. But apples only spawn *on land* when the river is clean. Since I'm at (7,7), and dirt is around me (especially in the adjacent cells), I need to clean dirt to make land clean and enable apple spawning.

However, I can only clean dirt *if I am on a cell with dirt*. Currently, I'm at (7,7), which has no dirt. So I must first move to a cell with dirt to clean it.

Let’s analyze:

- (6,8): dirt — I can go there
- (7,8): dirt — I can go there
- (6,7): dirt — I can go there
- (7,6): dirt — I can go there

All are adjacent. Let’s pick one — say (7,6). I can move down to (7,6), clean it, then possibly move around to clean others.

But cleaning dirt gives no points

  Thinking: At (5,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apple spawning, the river must be clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. However, cleaning dirt gives no points, only enables apples to spawn later.

**Action: stay**  
Reasoning: Without knowing what's around, moving blindly risks missing opportunities. Staying allows you to assess the environment. If dirt is present, you can clean it. If apples are nearby, you’ll be able to eat them once the river is clean. Since nothing is visible, staying is the safest and most strategic first step.

--- Step 1 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,5). Dirt at (7,6), (7,4).
  Thinking: At (5,5), there's no apple currently. The only dirt is at (7,6) and (7,4), both of which are not adjacent to (5,5).  

To spawn apples, the river must be clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. But since we can only clean dirt when we are on the same cell, we must move to a dirt cell to clean it.  

We are at (5,5). The closest dirt is at (7,6) and (7,4). We need to move to one of those cells to clean it.  

Option: Move to (7,6) → requires moving right to (6,6), then down to (7,6).  
After cleaning (7,6), we can then move to (7,4) to clean that too.  

But note: cleaning dirt gives no points, only enables apples to spawn on land when clean.  

So, **first action: move to (7,6)** (right → down).  
Then clean it.  
Then move to (7,4) (left → left).  
Clean it.  

Now the river is clean — apples may spawn on land. But we need to be on land to eat
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (9,7). Dirt at (7,8), (7,6).
  Thinking: At (9,7), you are not on any dirt, so you cannot clean it directly. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned to allow apples to appear. Currently, dirt is at (7,8) and (7,6), which are not adjacent to you.  

To clean dirt, you must move to a cell with dirt and then use the "clean" action. Since you're at (9,7), the closest dirt is at (7,8) and (7,6), both of which are two cells away diagonally or vertically. You'd need to move to one of those positions to clean them.  

But cleaning dirt gives no points — only eating apples does. So, unless apples spawn after cleaning, there's no immediate benefit.  

Right now, there are no apples on land, so you cannot eat.  

Best action: **Move left to (8,7)**, then possibly to (7,7) to get closer to (7,8) or (7,6). From there, you can clean dirt and potentially enable apple spawning.  

**Action: left**.
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (9,0). Dirt at (8,1), (8,0).
  Thinking: At (9,0), you are adjacent to dirt at (8,0) and (8,1). You cannot eat an apple yet because there are no apples present — apples only spawn when the river is clean, which depends on dirt being cleaned.

To enable apple spawning, you must clean dirt. You are at (9,0), so you can move left to (8,0) to clean that dirt. After cleaning (8,0), you can then consider moving to (8,1) to clean it as well, which would make the river cleaner and allow apples to spawn.

**Action: left**  
→ Move to (8,0) to clean the dirt.  
This is necessary to progress toward a clean river and eventually eating apples.  

**Reasoning:** Cleaning dirt is required to enable apple spawning, and you can only clean what you're on. Moving left to (8,0) is the first step.

--- Step 2 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,5). Dirt at (7,6), (8,5), (7,4).
  Thinking: At (6,5), I can see dirt at (7,6), (8,5), and (7,4). I cannot eat any apples yet because there are no apples spawned — apples only appear when the river is clean, which depends on removing dirt.

To enable apple spawning, I must clean dirt. I can only clean dirt that is on my current cell. Since none of the dirt cells are at (6,5), I cannot clean any dirt right now.

Therefore, I should **move** to a dirt cell to clean it.

Best move: **right** to (7,5) — not a dirt cell.  
**down** to (7,5) — still not dirt.  
**down** to (7,5), then **right** to (8,5) — that’s a dirt cell.

So, best path: **down** to (7,5), then **right** to (8,5) — clean (8,5).

But I can only clean if I'm on the cell. So I must move to (8,5) to clean it.

Action sequence:

1. **down** to (7,5)  
2. **right** to (8,5)
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,7). Dirt at (6,8), (7,8), (7,6).
  Thinking: At (8,7), you are not on any dirt cells. The dirt is at (6,8), (7,8), (7,6) — all of which are not adjacent to your current position.  

To eat an apple, the river must be clean (i.e., dirt must be removed), and apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Since you're not on dirt, you can't clean it directly.  

You need to move to a dirt cell to clean it. The nearest dirt cells are:  
- (7,8): adjacent to (8,7) — one step left  
- (7,6): two steps down and one step left → farther  
- (6,8): one step left and one step up → farther  

Best move: **left** to (7,7). From there, you can go to (7,8) to clean dirt.  

But wait — you can only clean dirt *on your current cell*. So you must move to a dirt cell first.  

(Staying or moving randomly without exploration risks missing opportunities to clean and spawn apples.)
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,7). Dirt at (6,8), (7,8), (6,7), (7,6).
  Thinking: At (6,7), you can see dirt at (6,7), (6,8), (7,8), and (7,6). Since you are on a cell with dirt (6,7), you can **clean** it. Cleaning dirt does not give points directly, but it helps make the river cleaner, which enables apples to spawn on land.

Currently, apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning less dirt. By cleaning (6,7), you reduce dirt in your area, which may eventually allow apples to spawn on land (especially if other dirt is cleaned too).

Available actions:
- **clean**: possible (on (6,7))
- **eat**: not possible (no apple at (6,7))
- Move: could help access other dirt cells, but no immediate benefit

**Best action: clean**

Reason: Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning. Since you're on a dirt cell, cleaning it is the only immediate action that advances progress toward enabling apples. Eating is not possible yet.

👉 **Action: clean**
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (5,0), nothing is visible, so I don't know if there's dirt or an apple. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first determine if there's dirt to clean.

However, with no visible items, I cannot confirm if dirt exists. Without any information about surroundings, the safest action is to **stay** — to avoid moving into unknown areas and to preserve position for potential future action.

**Action: stay**  
Reasoning: No visible items, so no immediate opportunity to eat or clean. Staying ensures I don’t lose position and can assess the environment when more information becomes available.

--- Step 21 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,2), nothing is visible. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first check if there's dirt to clean. Without sight of anything, I cannot determine if there's dirt or an apple.

Action: **stay**  
Reason: I need to gather more information. Staying in place allows me to potentially detect dirt or apples in my current cell if they appear later. Without visual input, I cannot safely clean or eat. Waiting is the safest first step.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,7). Dirt at (6,8), (7,8), (7,6).
  Thinking: At (6,7), I see dirt at (6,8), (7,8), and (7,6). I cannot eat an apple because there is no apple visible—apples only spawn when the river is clean, which requires cleaning dirt. Since I'm not on any dirt cell, I can't clean it directly.

I must first move to a dirt cell to clean it. The closest dirt cells are (6,8) and (7,6). 

Let’s evaluate:

- (6,8): directly above me → move up to (6,8)
- (7,6): down and left → farther

Best move: **up** to (6,8), then clean.

After cleaning (6,8), I can assess if apples now spawn. But since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., all dirt is gone), and we only cleaned one cell, more dirt remains.

I should clean all dirt cells systematically.

But I can only clean one at a time and only on my current cell.

So, optimal path:
1. Move up to (6,8) → clean → dirt removed
2. Move down to (7,8) → clean → dirt removed
3. Move
  Decision: 'up' -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (5,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately.  

**Reasoning:**  
- To eat apples, there must be apples (which only spawn on land when the river is clean).  
- To spawn apples, the river must be clean — which requires cleaning dirt.  
- Since you see nothing, you don’t know if there’s dirt or an apple.  

**Action:**  
→ **clean** (to start cleaning dirt, potentially enabling apple spawning in the future).  

This is a safe and strategic move: cleaning dirt may eventually lead to apple spawning, which gives points. Without cleaning, you risk missing opportunities.  

**Next step:** After cleaning, monitor for apple spawns.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,2), nothing is visible, so I don't know if there's dirt or an apple. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points, I must first check if there's dirt to clean.  

But with no visible items, I cannot determine if dirt exists. Therefore, I should **stay** to maintain my position and assess the environment further.  

**Action: stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,8). Dirt at (6,8), (7,8).
  Thinking: At (6,8), there is dirt. I can **clean** it since I'm on a cell with dirt. Cleaning dirt gives no points, but it's necessary to enable apples to spawn. After cleaning (6,8), the dirt is removed. There's still dirt at (7,8), so I need to move to (7,8) to clean that too.

But I can only eat apples when the river is clean — meaning when there's no dirt on land. So, cleaning both (6,8) and (7,8) will make the land clean, allowing apples to spawn.

**Action: clean** (at (6,8))  
Then move **right** to (7,8) and **clean** there.

Only after both are cleaned can apples spawn. Since I can't eat yet (no apples), I must prioritize cleaning.

**Next step: clean (6,8)** → then move to (7,8) → clean (7,8)

Then, if apples spawn, I can eat them.

**Final reasoning:** Clean dirt first to enable apple spawning. No points from cleaning, but essential. After both cells are clean, apples may appear — then I can eat them for +1.
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (5,0), I see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, I cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apple spawning, I must first clean dirt. However, no dirt is visible, so I cannot clean.  

Without dirt to clean, apples won’t spawn. Therefore, I must explore to find dirt or apples.  

Action: **right** — to move toward possible dirt or other cells where dirt might be present.  

Reasoning: Exploration is necessary to find dirt for cleaning, which in turn enables apple spawning. Without dirt, no apples can appear.

--- Step 23 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,2), nothing is visible, so I don't know if there's dirt or an apple. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first check if there's dirt to clean.  

Without any visible items, I cannot eat an apple. Therefore, I should **stay** to assess the situation further — perhaps dirt is nearby or will appear once I move.  

**Action: stay**  
(Reason: No visible items; cannot eat or clean without knowing the environment. Staying allows for better situational awareness.)
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,8). Dirt at (7,8).
  Thinking: You are at (6,8). There is dirt at (7,8), which is to your right.  

You cannot clean dirt unless you are on the same cell. So, to clean the dirt at (7,8), you must move to (7,8).  

Action: **right** to move to (7,8).  
Then, **clean** to remove the dirt.  

Cleaning dirt does not give points, but it enables apples to spawn on land (since the river is now cleaner). After cleaning, if apples spawn, you can later eat them for +1.0 each.  

**Reasoning**: Clean the dirt first to enable apple spawning. Without cleaning, no apples can appear.  

Next step: Move to a cell with apples (if any) and eat them.  

**Action: right → clean**.
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Dirt at (8,0).
  Thinking: You are at (6,0). Dirt is at (8,0).  

To clean dirt, you must be on the same cell as the dirt. You are not currently on (8,0), so you cannot clean it yet.  

Action: **move right** to (7,0), then to (8,0) to clean the dirt.  

After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn (though apples only spawn on land when the river is clean). But since apples don't spawn automatically and you need to be on land with an apple to eat it, you must first clean the dirt to enable possible apple spawning.  

Best next step: **right** (to reach (8,0) to clean).  

**Reasoning**: Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning. You cannot eat apples unless the river is clean, and you can only clean dirt when on the same cell. Move to (8,0) to clean.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,2), nothing is visible. Since there are no apples or dirt visible, I cannot eat or clean immediately.  

**Reasoning**: To eat apples, the river must be clean (i.e., dirt must be cleaned), and apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Since I currently see nothing, I don’t know if there's dirt or apples nearby.  

**Action**: I should **move** to explore the area (e.g., check adjacent cells) to find dirt to clean or apples to eat.  

Best first move: **up** (to (6,2)) to investigate.  

→ **Action: up**
  Decision: 'up' -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,8). Dirt at (7,8).
  Thinking: You are at (7,8), and there is dirt at your position.  

Action: **clean**  
Reason: You can only eat apples when there is clean land, and apples only spawn on clean land. Since there is dirt at your current position, you must clean it first to enable apple spawning. Cleaning dirt gives no points directly, but it's necessary to unlock the ability to eat apples later.  

After cleaning, you can then assess whether apples have spawned and decide whether to eat them.  

→ **Action: clean**
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Dirt at (8,0).
  Thinking: You are at (7,0). Dirt is at (8,0), which is to your right.  

Action: **right**  
Reason: You need to move to (8,0) to clean the dirt. Cleaning dirt doesn't give points, but it's necessary to make apples spawn later. After cleaning, you can potentially enable apple spawning on land, allowing you to eat apples and gain points.  

→ Move right to (8,0), then clean.  

Next step: After cleaning, check if apples have spawned (though no apples are mentioned yet). If apples appear, you can eat them.  

Current best move: **right**.

--- Step 25 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,3). Dirt at (7,2).
  Thinking: At (7,3), there is dirt at (7,2) directly below you. Since you can only clean dirt when you are on the same cell, you cannot clean (7,2) from (7,3).  

There are no apples mentioned, and apples only spawn when the river is clean — which depends on dirt being cleaned. Since you're not on the dirt cell, you can't clean it yet.  

**Action: move down to (7,2)**  
→ Then you can clean the dirt.  

After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn (though not confirmed yet). Then you can return to (7,3) to eat apples if they appear.  

**Reasoning**: Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning. You must be on the dirt to clean it. Therefore, move down to (7,2) to clean it.  

**Next action: down** ✅
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,8). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,8), nothing is visible. Since there are no apples or dirt visible, I cannot eat or clean immediately.  

**Reasoning:**  
- To eat apples, there must be an apple on the grid, which only spawns when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned).  
- Cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary to enable apple spawning.  
- With nothing visible, I cannot confirm if there's dirt or an apple.  

**Action: stay**  
I will stay at (7,8) to assess the environment. If something appears later (e.g., dirt or an apple), I can act accordingly.  

**Next step:** Monitor surroundings — if dirt appears, clean it; if apple appears, eat it.  

→ **Action: stay**

Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Dirt at (8,0).
  Thinking: You are at (8,0), and there is dirt at your position.  

Action: **clean**  
Reasoning: You can only gain apples when the river is clean (i.e., when there's no dirt). Since you're currently on dirt, you must clean it first. Cleaning dirt gives no points directly, but it's necessary to enable apples to spawn. After cleaning, if apples appear, you can then eat them for +1.0 points.  

→ Do **clean**.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Dirt at (7,2).
  Thinking: You are at (7,2), and there is dirt at your position.  

Action: **clean**  
Reason: You can only clean dirt when you are on a cell with dirt. Cleaning it is necessary to make the river clean (which enables apples to spawn). Since apples only appear when the river is clean, and you can't eat apples without first cleaning dirt, you must clean the dirt at (7,2) to potentially enable future apple spawning.  

No points are earned from cleaning, but it's a required step.  

Next step: After cleaning, check if apples have appeared (though not visible here). If apples spawn, you can then eat them.  

Current action: **clean**.
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,8). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,8), nothing is visible. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first check if there's dirt to clean. Without any visible items, I cannot eat an apple.  

Action: **stay**  
Reason: No visible dirt or apples. Moving would risk missing a potential clean-up opportunity. Staying allows me to assess the situation further—perhaps dirt is nearby or will appear when the river is cleaned. Without information, best to remain and wait for actionable data.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first determine if there's dirt to clean.

However, since you see nothing, it's likely that your current cell is either clean or empty. Without dirt, you cannot clean it, and without dirt being cleaned, apples won't spawn.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: You cannot eat an apple if none are present, and cleaning requires dirt. Since nothing is visible, and you have no information about dirt or apples, staying is safe. You may later discover dirt or apples when moving.  

**Next step:** If you move, you might find dirt or apples—so staying allows you to assess the environment before acting.

  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Dirt at (8,1), (6,0), (8,0).
  Thinking: At (8,0), you see dirt at (8,0), (8,1), and (6,0). You can only clean dirt or eat apples **on your current cell**.

- You are at (8,0), which has dirt. So you can **clean** it.
- There's no apple at (8,0) currently — apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned).
- Cleaning dirt gives no points, but it's necessary to enable apples to spawn.

**Action: clean**  
→ Cleaning (8,0) removes dirt from that cell. Now, the river is cleaner in that area, which may allow apples to spawn eventually.

After cleaning, you can consider moving to check other dirt locations or wait for apples to spawn. But since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and no apples are visible yet, **cleaning is the only beneficial action now**.

✅ Reasoning: Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning. No apples are present, and eating would be pointless without apples.

  Obs: You at (7,5). Dirt at (7,6), (8,5), (7,4).
  Thinking: At (7,5), I see dirt at (7,6), (8,5), and (7,4). I am not on any of the dirt cells, so I cannot clean them directly.  

To eat an apple, the river must be clean — meaning dirt must be removed. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Since I'm currently at (7,5), and dirt is adjacent (up, down, left, right), I need to move to a dirt cell to clean it.  

Let’s evaluate options:

- **Clean at (7,6)**: I can move to (7,6) and clean it.  
- **Clean at (8,5)**: Move to (8,5) and clean it.  
- **Clean at (7,4)**: Move to (7,4) and clean it.  

All are adjacent. Cleaning any of these will reduce dirt, potentially enabling apple spawning on land.  

But: **I can only clean dirt when I’m on that cell.** I must move to a dirt cell to clean it.  

Currently, I have **no apple** at (7,5) — no apple is mentioned, so I can't eat.
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,7). Dirt at (6,8), (7,8), (7,6).
  Thinking: At (7,7), there is no apple currently. Dirt is at (6,8), (7,8), and (7,6) — all adjacent or nearby, but not directly on your current cell.

To spawn apples, the river must be clean (i.e., dirt must be removed). Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and you can only clean dirt *at your position*, you must first move to a cell with dirt to clean it.

However, you are currently at (7,7), which is adjacent to dirt at (7,6) and (7,8), but not directly on them. So:

- You can **move to (7,6)** or **(7,8)** to clean dirt.
- Cleaning dirt gives no points, but enables apple spawning on land (i.e., on cells that are now clean).
- After cleaning, if the river is clean, apples may spawn on land (but only if the land cells are adjacent to clean river).

But currently, there are no apples visible, and no apple is at (7,7).

**Best action: Move to (7,6) or (7,8) to clean dirt.**

Let’s pick **right →
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Dirt at (8,1), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (8,0), you see dirt at (8,1) and (6,0).  

- You **cannot eat an apple** yet because there are no apples visible, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned).  
- You can **clean dirt** only if you are on the same cell as the dirt.  
- You are at (8,0), so you can **clean the dirt at (8,1)** only if you move there.  
- The dirt at (6,0) is not adjacent — you’d need to move left to (7,0), then (6,0) to clean it.  

**Best action: move up to (8,1)** to clean the dirt there.  

After cleaning (8,1), the river becomes cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn. Then, you can move around to check for apples.  

**Action: up**.

--- Step 4 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,5). Dirt at (7,6), (8,5), (7,4).
  Thinking: At (6,5), I see dirt at (7,6), (8,5), and (7,4). I am not on any of the dirt cells, so I cannot clean them directly. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning I must clean dirt to enable apple spawning.

Currently, I am at (6,5), which is not on any dirt. To clean dirt, I must move to a dirt cell. The closest dirt cells are:

- (8,5): directly to the right
- (7,6): up-right
- (7,4): up-left

Best move: **right to (8,5)** — it's adjacent and directly reachable.

**Action: right**

Now I am at (8,5), which has dirt. I can clean it.

**Action: clean** (on (8,5))

This removes dirt from (8,5), contributing to a cleaner river and possibly enabling apple spawning on adjacent land.

After cleaning, I can consider moving to check other dirt cells or eat if apples appear. But currently, no apples are visible.

**Next step:** After cleaning (8,5), I can move to (7,5) or (8,
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,7). Dirt at (6,8), (7,8), (7,6).
  Thinking: At (8,7), you are not on any dirt cells. Dirt is at (6,8), (7,8), (7,6) — all of which are not adjacent to your current position.

To eat apples, the river must be clean (i.e., dirt must be removed), and apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Since you're not on any dirt, you cannot clean it directly.

**Available actions:**
- You can move to a neighboring cell (up, down, left, right) to get closer to dirt.
- You can only clean dirt if you are on the same cell as dirt.

**Best move:** Move left to (7,7) — this is adjacent to (7,6) and (7,8), which are dirt cells. From there, you can potentially clean (7,6) or (7,8) if you reach them.

**Plan:**
1. Move left to (7,7).
2. From (7,7), move up to (7,8) → clean dirt at (7,8).
3. Then move down to (7,6) → clean dirt at (7,6).
4. Then move to (6,8
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (7,2), (8,1), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (8,1), you are currently on a cell that has dirt. You can **clean** this dirt, which is necessary to potentially enable apple spawning. However, cleaning dirt gives no points directly.

Current dirt positions: (7,2), (8,1), (6,0)

- You are at (8,1), which has dirt → you can clean it.
- Cleaning (8,1) will remove dirt from that cell, potentially helping the river become cleaner and allowing apples to spawn *if* those cells are adjacent to water or part of a river system (though the exact river layout isn't specified).

Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (less dirt), and you can only clean dirt at your current position, the best immediate action is:

👉 **Clean** (8,1)

Reasoning: Cleaning dirt is required to enable apple spawning. Eating apples is only possible after the river is clean, and you can't eat unless you're on a cell with an apple. Since no apples are mentioned, and you're on a dirt cell, cleaning first is necessary.

**Action: clean**

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,5). Dirt at (7,6), (8,5), (7,4).
  Thinking: At (6,5), I see dirt at (7,6), (8,5), and (7,4). I am not on any of those dirt cells, so I cannot clean them directly.  

To eat apples, the river must be clean — meaning dirt must be removed. But cleaning only happens when I am on a dirt cell.  

Currently, I am at (6,5), which is not on any dirt. So I must move to a dirt cell to clean it.  

Let’s assess possible moves:  
- (7,6): dirt — can clean if I move there  
- (8,5): dirt — can clean if I move there  
- (7,4): dirt — can clean if I move there  

All are reachable. But I need to consider: cleaning dirt gives no points, but enables apple spawning. Apples only spawn when the river is clean — so cleaning is necessary.  

Since I can only eat apples *after* cleaning, and I currently have no apples, I should first clean dirt.  

Best first step: move to a dirt cell to clean it.  

--- Step 27 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,2), nothing is visible. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first check if there's dirt to clean. Without any visible items, I cannot eat an apple.  

**Action: stay**  
Reason: I cannot eat or clean anything without knowing the state of the cell. Staying allows me to assess the situation further—perhaps dirt is present and needs cleaning to enable future apple spawning. Moving without knowing the environment risks missing a necessary action.  

Next step: observe or check surroundings after staying.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,8). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,8), nothing is visible, so I don't know if there's dirt or an apple. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first check if there's dirt to clean.

However, with nothing in view, I cannot confirm the state of the cell. Therefore, the safest action is to **stay** to assess the situation further.  

**Action: stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first check if there's dirt to clean. Without any visible items, it's likely that the current cell or nearby cells have dirt that needs to be cleaned.

However, since you see nothing, it's safest to **clean** if you're on a dirt cell — but you don't know that for sure. In absence of information, the best action is to **clean**, as it may enable apple spawning later.

**Action: clean**  
(Reason: Cleaning dirt is necessary to allow apples to spawn, and since apples don't appear without a clean river, cleaning is a prerequisite for future apple collection. Without cleaning, no apples can appear.)

--- Step 28 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,2), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately.  

First, you need to explore to find dirt (to clean) or apples (to eat). Cleaning dirt enables apples to spawn, so if you find dirt, cleaning it is necessary before apples can appear.  

**Action: left**  
→ Move to (6,2) to explore nearby.  

*Reasoning: Without any visible items, exploration is essential. Moving left is a safe, logical first step to check adjacent cells for dirt or apples.*
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,8). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,8), nothing is visible. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first check if there's dirt to clean. Without visibility, I can't determine if there's dirt or an apple.  

**Action: stay**  
Reasoning: I need to assess my current cell. Without any view, I can't safely eat or clean. Staying allows me to remain in position and possibly gain information if something changes or if I can detect dirt/apples via system updates. Moving without information risks missing a valuable opportunity or ending up in a barren area.  

**Next step:** Wait for updated view or detect surroundings.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first check if there's dirt to clean.

However, with nothing in view, it's likely that the current cell (8,0) is either clean or has no dirt. Without dirt, no apples can spawn, and you can't gain points from eating.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: There's no visible dirt or apple, so cleaning or eating is not possible. Staying allows you to remain in a position where you can later detect or interact with the environment if changes occur. It's safer than moving blindly.

--- Step 29 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,2), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apples to spawn, the river must be clean—meaning dirt must be cleaned. But since you don’t see any dirt or apples, you need to explore first.

Action: **left**  
Reason: Moving left may reveal dirt or other elements. Without any visible items, exploration is necessary before cleaning or eating. Cleaning only gives no points, but is required to enable apples. So, explore first to find dirt to clean and eventually apples.
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,8). Dirt at (6,8).
  Thinking: You are at (7,8). There is dirt at (6,8), which is directly to your left.  

Since you can only clean dirt or eat apples **at your current position**, you cannot clean the dirt at (6,8) from (7,8).  

Therefore, the only viable action is to **move left to (6,8)** to clean the dirt there.  

**Action: left**  
→ Now you are at (6,8) and can clean the dirt.  

Cleaning dirt gives no points, but it's necessary to potentially enable apple spawning in the future (since apples only spawn when the river is clean).  

**Next step:** After cleaning, you can assess if apples have appeared (though not explicitly stated). Since apples spawn when the river is clean, and dirt is now cleaned, it may now be possible to spawn apples. But currently, no apples are mentioned.  

**Final action: left** (to clean the dirt at (6,8)).
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apple spawning, you must first clean dirt — but you can only do so if dirt is present on your current cell.

Since nothing is visible, it's likely your cell is either clean or has no dirt. Without dirt, you can't clean, and without apples (which only spawn when the river is clean), you can't eat.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: You have no visible dirt or apples. Moving would risk leaving your current position without a clear reason. Staying allows you to assess the situation or wait for dirt or apples to appear — but since nothing is visible, staying is the safest and most logical choice.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (5,2), with nothing in view, I cannot see any apples or dirt. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when there's dirt to clean), and I can only clean or eat what's directly at my position, I must first check if there's dirt to clean.

But since nothing is visible, I assume there's no dirt or apple currently at (5,2). Without any item present, I cannot clean or eat.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: No visible item to clean or eat. Staying is safe and allows me to monitor the environment for changes or potential future actions.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):

  Thinking: You are at (6,8), and there is dirt at your position.  

Action: **clean**  
Reason: You can only eat apples when there is clean land, and apples spawn on clean land. Since there is dirt here, you must clean it first to enable apple spawning. Cleaning dirt gives no points, but it's necessary. After cleaning, you can potentially eat an apple if one spawns.  

Let’s pick (8,5) — it's adjacent (right of (6,5)? No — (6,

Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,7). Dirt at (6,8), (7,8), (7,6).
  Thinking: At (7,7), I see dirt at (6,8), (7,8), and (7,6). I am not on any of those dirt cells, so I cannot clean them directly.  

To eat an apple, the river must be clean (i.e., no dirt). But currently, there is dirt nearby — specifically at (7,6), (7,8), and (6,8). Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and I can't clean dirt unless I'm on it, I need to move to a dirt cell to clean it.  

I can move to (7,6), (7,8), or (6,8) to clean dirt. Cleaning dirt doesn't give points, but it’s necessary to eventually enable apples to spawn.  

**Best action: Move to (7,6)** — it's adjacent and directly below me.  

**Reasoning:** I must clean dirt to make the river clean and allow apples to spawn. Since I can't eat an apple now (no apple is present), I need to clean dirt first. Moving to (7,6) allows me to clean it and progress toward a clean environment.  

**Action: down** (to move to (
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (7,2), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (8,1), you are not on any dirt, so you cannot clean. There is no apple visible at your position.  

Dirt is at (7,2) and (6,0) — both are not adjacent to you. You cannot reach them directly without moving.  

Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and you can only clean dirt at your current cell, you must first move to a cell with dirt to clean it.  

Current options:  
- Move to (7,2) or (6,0) to clean dirt.  
- But you can only clean dirt *if you are on a cell with dirt*.  

So:  
→ Move to (7,2) or (6,0) to clean dirt.  
→ After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner → apples may spawn on land.  

But currently, no apples are available.  

**Best action: Move to (7,2)** (closest or reachable).  

**Action: right → (7,1)? Wait — (7,2) is not directly adjacent.**

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Dirt at (7,6), (8,6), (8,5), (7,4). Agent 2 at (7,6).
  Thinking: At (7,5), I see dirt at (7,6), (8,6), (8,5), (7,4). Agent 2 is at (7,6), which is a dirt cell.

First, check what I can do:
- I am at (7,5). I can move to adjacent cells or clean dirt if I’m on a dirt cell.
- I **cannot clean** dirt at (7,6), (8,6), (8,5), or (7,4) because I’m not on those cells.
- I **cannot eat** an apple because there’s no apple mentioned — apples only spawn when the river is clean, which requires cleaning dirt.

So, to enable apple spawning, I must clean dirt. But I can only clean dirt **on my current cell**.

Currently, (7,5) is **not** a dirt cell (dirt is at (7,6), (8,6), (8,5), (7,4)), so I can't clean anything here.

Therefore, I need to **move to a dirt cell** to clean it.

Best move: **move to (7,6)** — but Agent 2 is already there. Can't
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,6). Dirt at (7,6), (8,6), (8,5). Agent 1 at (7,5).
  Thinking: At (7,6), there is dirt. To eat apples, the river must be clean — meaning no dirt. Apples only spawn when dirt is cleaned, but cleaning dirt gives 0 points.  

Available actions:
- **Clean** at (7,6): removes dirt here, but gives 0 points.  
- **Eat**: cannot eat yet — no apple at (7,6) (only dirt).  
- Move: consider moving to adjacent cells to potentially clean dirt or reach apple-spawning areas.

Current dirt at: (7,6), (8,6), (8,5).  
Agent 1 is at (7,5) — possibly not relevant unless interacting.

**Best move**: Clean (7,6) to reduce dirt.  
After cleaning (7,6), dirt remains at (8,6) and (8,5).  
Then, move to (8,6) or (8,5) to clean those.  

**Reasoning**: Apples only spawn when dirt is gone. Cleaning is necessary but pointless directly. However, removing dirt enables future apple spawning.  
Immediate action: **clean** at (7,6).  

**Action: clean** ✅
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Dirt at (7,2), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (7,1), you are not on any dirt, so you cannot clean. There is no apple visible at your position.  

Dirt is at (7,2) and (6,0) — both are not adjacent to you. To clean dirt, you must move to a cell with dirt.  

Currently, no apples are present (apples only spawn when the river is clean, i.e., when dirt is cleaned).  

**Best action: move to (7,2) to clean dirt.**  
Cleaning dirt doesn't give points, but it enables future apple spawning. After cleaning (7,2), if the river becomes clean, apples may appear.  

**Action: right** (to move to (7,2))  

→ Reason: Clean dirt to enable apple spawning. Without cleaning, no apples can spawn.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,5). Dirt at (8,6), (8,5), (7,4). Agent 2 at (7,6).
  Thinking: At (8,5), I see dirt at (8,5), (8,6), and (7,4). I can only clean dirt or eat apples at my current position.

- I am currently on (8,5), which has dirt.  
- I can **clean** the dirt at (8,5) — this is necessary to make apples spawn later, but cleaning gives no points.  
- There is no apple at (8,5) currently — apples only spawn when the river is clean, i.e., when dirt is removed.  
- Apples spawn on land when the river is clean — so if I clean (8,5), it may allow apples to spawn on adjacent land cells (but only if the river is clean).  
- Agent 2 is at (7,6), which may be a distraction — unless they interfere, I should focus on my own position.

**Action: clean**  
Reasoning: Cleaning dirt at (8,5) is necessary to enable apple spawning in the future. Since eating apples gives +1.0 points and cleaning gives 0, I must clean to make apples possible. I cannot eat now because no apple exists.  

→ **Action: clean**
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,6). Dirt at (8,6), (8,5). Agent 1 at (8,5).
  Thinking: At (7,6), I see dirt at (8,6) and (8,5). Agent 1 is at (8,5), which is a dirt cell. I cannot clean dirt at (8,5) directly because I'm not on that cell. I can only clean dirt if I'm on it.

Available actions:
- Move to (8,6) to clean dirt there.
- Move to (8,5) to clean dirt, but Agent 1 is there — can I move there? The rules don’t specify if agents block movement, but typically in such games, agents occupy cells and block movement unless stated otherwise. So likely, I cannot move to (8,5) due to Agent 1.

So, only safe move is to (8,6), where there is dirt.

**Action: move right to (8,6)**  
Then **clean** the dirt there.

After cleaning (8,6), the river becomes cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn on land. But apples only spawn *when the river is clean*, and only *on land*. I need to check if any land cells are now eligible.

Currently, I am at (8,6). After cleaning, dirt is removed. But
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (7,2), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (8,1), you are not on any dirt, so you cannot clean. There's no apple visible at your position.  

Dirt is at (7,2) and (6,0) — both are not adjacent to you. So you can't clean them directly.  

Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — but since you can't reach the dirt cells to clean them, no apples can spawn.  

**Action: stay**  
Reason: You can't clean dirt or eat apples from your current position. Moving away won’t help unless you can reach dirt. Staying is safe and allows you to assess if any dirt becomes accessible later.  

**Next step:** If dirt is reachable, clean it to enable apple spawning. For now, no action gives points — best to stay.  

→ **Stay** ✅
→ Do **clean**.
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apples to spawn, the river must be clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. However, cleaning dirt gives no points, only enables apple spawning.

But since you see nothing, you don’t know if there’s dirt or an apple nearby. Without any visible items, the safest action is to **move** to explore and gather information.

Best next step: **right** (to (9,0)) — to check if there’s dirt or an apple in that direction.

Reasoning: You need to locate dirt to clean (to enable apples), or an apple to eat. Without any view, exploration is necessary. Moving right is a safe, logical first step.

  Thinking: At (5,2), nothing is visible. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first check if there's dirt to clean. Without visibility, I can't confirm the state of the cell or surroundings.

Action: **stay**  
Reasoning: I need to assess my current cell. Without knowing if there's dirt or an apple, I can't safely clean or eat. Staying allows me to gather more information or act once I have visibility or a better understanding of the environment.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,8). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,8), nothing is visible. Since there are no apples or dirt visible, I cannot eat or clean immediately.  

**Reasoning:** To eat apples, the river must be clean (i.e., dirt must be cleaned), and apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Since I'm not seeing any dirt or apples, I must first explore to find dirt to clean.  

**Action:** `left` — to explore the area and possibly find dirt to clean.  

(Next step: Once dirt is found, clean it. Then, if apples appear, eat them.)
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (9,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (9,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately.  

First, check if you can see any dirt or apples — but since nothing is visible, it's likely the area is either clean or out of view.  

However, apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and you can only clean dirt *at your position*. So, unless there's dirt here, you can't spawn apples.  

Since nothing is visible, assume (9,0) may currently have no dirt or apples.  

**Best action: stay**  
→ You can't move to find something useful without information.  
→ You can't clean or eat without visibility or presence of items.  

**Reasoning:** Without visible dirt or apples, and with no indication of nearby resources, staying is safest. You might later move when more information becomes available.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (5,2), nothing is visible. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first check if there's dirt to clean. Without any visible items, I cannot eat an apple.  

Action: **stay**  
Reason: No visible items, so I cannot eat or clean. Staying allows me to assess the environment next turn.

Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,8). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (5,8), nothing is visible, so I don't know if there's dirt or an apple. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when there's dirt cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first check if there's dirt to clean.

But with no view, I cannot determine the state of the cell or surroundings. Therefore, I should **stay** to assess the situation further.  

**Action: stay**  

Reason: Without visibility, I cannot safely clean dirt or eat an apple. Staying allows me to gather more information before acting.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (9,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (9,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately.  

**Reasoning**: To eat apples, the river must be clean (i.e., dirt must be removed), and apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Since you currently see nothing, it's likely your position is either on clean land or there's no dirt to clean. Without dirt to clean or apples to eat, no action yields points.  

**Best action**: **stay** — to monitor the environment. If you later see dirt or apples, you can act accordingly.

  Thinking: At (5,2), nothing is visible. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first check if there's dirt to clean. Without any visible items, I cannot eat an apple.  

**Action: stay**  
Reason: No visible items to eat or clean. Staying in place is safe and allows for better situational awareness before taking any action.

Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,8). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (5,8), nothing is visible. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first check if there's dirt to clean. Without any visible items, I cannot eat an apple.  

Action: **clean** (if dirt is present) — but since nothing is visible, I cannot confirm.  

Best course: **stay** — to remain in position and assess.  

Reasoning: Without knowing the state of the cell (dirt or clean), I cannot safely clean or eat. Staying allows observation or waiting for new information.  

→ **stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (9,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (9,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and you can only eat apples or clean dirt when on a cell, you must first determine whether there's dirt to clean or an apple to eat.

But since nothing is visible, it's possible that the cell is clean and has no apple — or it might have dirt that isn't visible. However, the rule says: *apples only spawn on land when the river is clean*. So, if the river is not clean (i.e., dirt exists elsewhere), apples won’t appear.

Given that you’re at (9,0) and see nothing, it’s likely either:
- The cell is clean and empty (no apple, no dirt), or
- There's dirt, but it's not visible (so you must clean it).

But you can only clean dirt **if you are on a cell with dirt**. Since you see nothing, and there's no indication of dirt or apple, it's safest to **stay** and assess further.

However, without any information about the surrounding terrain or river state, and since you can't act without knowing what's there, the best action is to **stay** to avoid moving into potentially unproductive or risky areas

--- Step 8 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,5). Dirt at (8,6), (6,4), (7,4). Agent 2 at (8,6).
  Thinking: At (8,5), I see dirt at (8,6), (6,4), and (7,4). Agent 2 is at (8,6), which is adjacent to my current position.

- I **cannot** eat an apple yet because there's no apple mentioned at my position (8,5). Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned.
- Dirt at (8,6) is directly adjacent to me, and Agent 2 is currently there. Since I can only clean dirt **on my cell**, I cannot clean (8,6) unless I move there and clean it.
- I must first **move to a dirt cell** to clean it, which will help make land available for apples to spawn.

Best move: **Move up** or **left** to reach a dirt cell?  
- (8,6) is directly above me — if I move to (8,6), I can clean it. But Agent 2 is already there.  
- Can I clean (8,6) if Agent 2 is there? No — only I can clean dirt, and I can only clean when I’m on the cell. So I cannot clean (8,6
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,6). Dirt at (8,6). Agent 1 at (8,5).
  Thinking: At (8,6), there is dirt, and you can clean it. Cleaning dirt gives no points directly, but it's necessary to enable apples to spawn on land. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt), cleaning the dirt at (8,6) will help create conditions for apples to appear.

Currently, there's no apple visible, and you're on a cell with dirt. You cannot eat an apple yet. 

Action: **clean**  
Reason: Cleaning the dirt is required to enable apple spawning. Without cleaning, apples won't appear, and you can't gain points. This step is essential for future apple spawns.  

After cleaning, you may have a better chance to find apples later. Stay or move strategically based on future updates, but currently, cleaning is the only beneficial action.  

✅ Action: clean
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (7,2), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (8,1), you are not on any dirt, so you cannot clean. There's no apple visible at your position.  

Dirt is at (7,2) and (6,0) — both are not adjacent to you. You can only clean dirt if you are on the same cell.  

To enable apples to spawn, the river must be clean (i.e., dirt must be removed). But cleaning dirt gives no points — only apples give +1.0.  

So, first, you must move to a cell with dirt to clean it.  

Best action: **move left to (7,1)** — adjacent to (7,2), which has dirt. Then you can clean it.  

After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner, potentially enabling apple spawning. Then, if apples appear, you can eat them.  

**Action: left**.

--- Step 9 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (9,5). Dirt at (7,4). Agent 2 at (8,6).
  Thinking: At (9,5), there is no apple visible, and the only dirt is at (7,4), which is not adjacent to your current position. You cannot clean dirt or eat apples unless you are on the same cell as the dirt or apple.

Since you are at (9,5), and dirt is at (7,4), you must move closer to clean it. The closest path is to go left or down to get near (7,4). However, cleaning dirt gives no points, but it's necessary to enable apple spawning — so cleaning is essential if apples are to spawn later.

But currently, there's no apple at your position. So, the best immediate action is to **move left or down** to get closer to (7,4) to clean it.

Best action: **left** (to (9,4)) — this moves you closer to (7,4) in a logical path (eventually toward cleaning).

Wait — (7,4) is two cells left and one down from (9,5). So best path: **down to (9,4)** → **left to (8,4)** → **left to (7,4)**.

But you can only act one step at a time
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,6). Agent 1 at (9,5).
  Thinking: At (8,6), I am not on a dirt cell, so I cannot clean. There's no apple visible here, and I have no information about the river's cleanliness or apple spawn status. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first determine if there's dirt to clean nearby.

Agent 1 is at (9,5), which is adjacent to me. However, without knowing if there's dirt at my current position or nearby, I cannot act.

**Reasoning:** I am at (8,6). To spawn apples, the river must be clean—so I need to clean dirt if present. Since I cannot clean dirt unless I'm on a dirt cell, and I don’t know the state of the terrain at (8,6), I must first check if there's dirt here.

**Action:** Stay — to assess the situation. If there's dirt, I can clean it. If not, I may need to move to find dirt or apples.

**Final action: stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Dirt at (7,2), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (7,1), you are not on any dirt, so you can't clean. There's dirt at (7,2) and (6,0), but you can only clean dirt when you are on the same cell.  

Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. Since you're not on dirt cells, you can't clean them directly.  

Action options:  
- Move to (7,2) to clean dirt there.  
- Move to (6,0) to clean dirt there.  
- Stay at (7,1) — no apple or dirt to interact with.  

Best move: **Move down to (6,1)** or **move right to (7,2)** to clean dirt.  

But (7,2) is directly adjacent — best first step: **right → (7,2)**.  

**Action: right**  
→ Now at (7,2), can clean dirt.  

After cleaning (7,2), dirt is gone — river is cleaner, so apples may spawn. But apple spawning is not guaranteed; it depends on overall river cleanliness, which isn't fully specified.  

But since apples only spawn *when the river is clean*, and we

--- Step 10 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,5). Dirt at (6,4), (7,4). Agent 2 at (8,6).
  Thinking: At (8,5), you are not on any dirt, so you can't clean. There's no apple visible at your position. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — currently, dirt is at (6,4) and (7,4), so the river is not clean yet, meaning no apples are spawning.

Agent 2 is at (8,6), but that doesn't affect you directly.

Best action: **move to a dirt cell** (e.g., (7,4) or (6,4)) to clean it and help make the river clean, which will eventually allow apples to spawn.

→ **Action: left** to (7,5) — not dirt.  
→ **Action: down** to (8,4) — not dirt.  
→ **Action: up** to (7,5) — still not dirt.  
→ **Action: left to (7,4)** — this is dirt!

So, move to (7,4), then **clean**.

**Best action: left to (7,4), then clean.**

Reasoning: Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning. Without cleaning, no apples appear. You must first reach a dirt cell to clean
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,6). Agent 1 at (8,5).
  Thinking: At (8,6), I am not on an apple (no apple indicated), and there's no mention of dirt to clean. Agent 1 is at (8,5), which is directly below me. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points, I must first determine if there's dirt to clean at my current position.

No dirt or apple is mentioned at (8,6). Therefore, I cannot eat or clean here. 

Best action: **stay** — to monitor the situation. If dirt appears or if I can move to a location with dirt, I can clean it to enable apple spawning. But currently, no action yields points.


--- Step 34 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (5,2), nothing is visible. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first check if there's dirt to clean. Without any visible items, I cannot eat an apple.  

**Action: stay**  
Reason: No visible dirt or apples. Moving would risk missing a potential cleaning opportunity. Staying allows me to assess the situation further—perhaps dirt is adjacent and will become visible if I move. But with nothing in view, I cannot act productively. Best first step: stay and wait for more information.  

→ **stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,8). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (5,8), nothing is visible, so I don't know if there's dirt or an apple. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first check the surroundings to determine if there's dirt to clean.

However, with no visible items, I cannot confirm if there's dirt or an apple. Without information about adjacent cells, I cannot take a safe action.

Best action: **stay** — to maintain position and assess the situation further.  

Reasoning: I have no information about the environment. Moving without knowing what's there could lead to wasted actions. Staying allows me to potentially detect dirt or apples in the next observation, if the game provides updates.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (9,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (9,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apple spawning, the river must be clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. However, cleaning dirt gives no points, so it's only done to enable future apple collection.

Since you're at (9,0) and see nothing, it's likely that there's no dirt or apple nearby. Without a clear view or indication of dirt/apples, the best action is to **move** to explore the area and find dirt or apples.

**Action: left**  
(To explore the grid toward potentially cleaner areas or dirt, as apples spawn when the river is clean — moving left might bring you closer to land or dirt that can be cleaned.)

  Thinking: At (5,2), nothing is visible. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first check if there's dirt to clean. Without any visible items, I cannot eat an apple.  

Action: **clean**  
Reason: To enable apple spawning, the river must be clean. Since I'm at (5,2) and nothing is visible, I must assume there might be dirt in my current cell. Cleaning it is necessary to eventually spawn apples. I will clean the dirt to set up future apple spawning.  

→ **clean**
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,8). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (5,8), nothing is visible. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first determine if there's dirt to clean. Without visibility, I cannot see dirt or apples.

**Action: stay**  
Reasoning: I cannot safely clean or eat without knowing what's in my current cell. Staying allows me to assess the situation. If I can later detect dirt or an apple, I can act accordingly. Moving without information risks missing opportunities or wasting steps.  

**Next step:** Wait for sensory input (e.g., dirt or apple detected) before acting.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Dirt at (6,0).
  Thinking: You are at (8,0). Dirt is at (6,0).  

You cannot clean dirt at (6,0) because you are not on that cell.  
You cannot eat an apple because there's no apple mentioned, and apples only spawn when the river is clean — but currently, dirt is present and not cleaned.  

**Action: move left to (7,0)**  
→ This brings you closer to the dirt at (6,0), allowing future cleaning.  

**Reasoning:** To enable apple spawning, you must clean dirt. You can only clean dirt when you are on the same cell. Moving left puts you one step closer to the dirt, so you can eventually clean it and enable apples to spawn.  

**Next step:** Once at (6,0), clean the dirt. Then, if apples spawn (due to clean river), you can eat them for points.  

**Current best action: left**.

  Thinking: At (5,2), nothing is visible. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first check if there's dirt to clean. Without any visible items, I cannot confirm if there's dirt or an apple.  

Since I can't eat or clean without knowing the state of the cell, and no action is possible with current info, the safest move is to **stay** and gather more information.  

**Action: stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,8). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (5,8), nothing is visible. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first check if there's dirt to clean. Without any visible items, I cannot eat an apple.  

Action: **stay**  
Reasoning: No visible items or dirt to clean or eat. Staying allows me to assess the environment further. If dirt appears later, I can act accordingly.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Dirt at (6,0).
  Thinking: At (7,0), you are adjacent to dirt at (6,0). Since you can only clean dirt when you are on the same cell, you cannot clean the dirt at (6,0) from (7,0).  

To clean dirt, you must move to a cell with dirt. So, move **left** to (6,0) to clean the dirt.  

Cleaning dirt doesn’t give points, but it’s necessary to enable apples to spawn on land — and eventually, you can eat apples for points.  

**Action: left** (to (6,0)) → clean dirt.  

Now, after cleaning, the land at (6,0) is clean, which may allow apples to spawn (though no apple is visible yet).  

Next step: check for apples or continue cleaning if more dirt exists.  

But based on current info:

Agent 1 (Low-Level):

  Thinking: At (5,2), nothing is visible, so I don't know if there's dirt or an apple. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first check the surroundings.

However, with no visible items, I cannot confirm whether there's dirt to clean or an apple to eat. Without any information about the state of the cell (dirt or apple), I cannot take action.

Best next step: **stay** — to remain at (5,2) and assess the situation further. If I had a view or sensory input, I could act accordingly. For now, no action is justified.

**Action: stay**.

Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,8). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (5,8), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apple spawning, you must first clean dirt. However, since nothing is visible, there's no confirmation of dirt or apples.

**Best action: stay**  
Reason: Without visibility of dirt or apples, moving would be futile. Staying allows you to assess the situation or wait for new information. If dirt is present, you can clean it when you're in a cell with it. Since nothing is visible, there's no immediate benefit in moving.  

→ **Stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (7,2), (6,0), (8,0).
  Thinking: At (8,1), I can see dirt at (7,2), (6,0), and (8,0). I am not on any dirt, so I cannot clean yet. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — but I don’t know where the river is or if those dirt cells are on it. However, since apples spawn only when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt enables that, I need to clean dirt to make apples possible.

But I can only clean dirt **if I am on the same cell** as the dirt.

I am at (8,1). The dirt is at (7,2), (6,0), (8,0). I am not on any of these. So I cannot clean any dirt right now.

Therefore, I must **move** to a dirt cell to clean it.

Best move: **down** to (8,0) — that’s directly adjacent and has dirt. From there, I can clean it.

**Action: down** → move to (8,0)  
Then: **clean** → removes dirt at (8,0)  

Now, with one dirt cleaned, the river is slightly cleaner. More apples may spawn on land nearby. But

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Dirt at (6,4), (7,4). Agent 2 at (8,6).
  Thinking: At (7,5), I see dirt at (6,4) and (7,4). I am not on any dirt, so I cannot clean yet. Apples only spawn when the river is clean, but since I'm not on dirt cells, I can't clean them directly.  

Agent 2 is at (8,6), which is far away and not relevant to my current position.  

I must first move to a dirt cell to clean it. The closest dirt is at (7,4) — directly above me.  

**Action: move down to (7,4)**  
→ Now I am on dirt at (7,4).  

**Action: clean**  
→ Dirt is cleaned. This helps the river become cleaner, enabling potential apple spawning.  

Now, with the river cleaner, apples might spawn on land nearby. But I still need to check if any apples are now available at my position or adjacent.  

Currently, no apples are mentioned, so I should stay cautious.  

**Next step: stay or move to check for apples?**  

Since apples spawn only when the river is clean, and I just cleaned dirt, it's now possible apples may appear. But no apples are visible.

  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,6). Agent 1 at (7,5).
  Thinking: At (8,6), I am not on a cell with an apple, and I don’t know the current state of the river or dirt levels. To eat an apple, I need to be on a land cell where apples spawn — which only happens when the river is clean (i.e., low dirt). Since cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary for apple spawning, I must first assess whether I can clean dirt to improve the river's cleanliness and enable apple spawning.

However, I currently don’t have information about the dirt levels or apple presence at (8,6). Since I can only act on my current cell, I should:

- Check if there's dirt to clean at (8,6).  
- If dirt is present, clean it to potentially help the river become cleaner and allow apples to spawn later.  
- If no dirt, I may need to move to a location where apples might spawn (e.g., closer to a known clean river area or agent location).

But since I don’t have data on dirt or apples, and I don’t know if (8,6) has dirt, the safest action is:

**clean** — to improve the river’s condition and enable future apple spawning, even if it gives no immediate points.

Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Dirt at (6,0), (8,0).
  Thinking: At (8,0), you see dirt at (6,0) and (8,0). You can only clean dirt *at your current position*.  

- You are at (8,0), which has dirt.  
- You can **clean** the dirt at (8,0) — this will make the river cleaner (indirectly enabling more apples to spawn later).  
- There’s no apple currently at (8,0).  

**Action: clean**  
→ Cleaning dirt at (8,0) is necessary to improve conditions for apples. Even though cleaning gives no points, it's required to eventually spawn apples.  

**Reasoning:** You cannot eat an apple unless the river is clean, and apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Since you're at (8,0) with dirt, cleaning it is the first logical step.  

**Next step:** After cleaning, check if apples can now spawn — possibly move to adjacent land cells to see if apples appear.

--- Step 12 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Dirt at (6,4), (7,4). Agent 2 at (8,6).
  Thinking: At (7,5), there is no apple currently available (apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and clean land depends on dirt being cleaned). Dirt is at (6,4) and (7,4), both of which are not adjacent to (7,5).  

To spawn apples, the river must be clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. However, I am at (7,5), and the dirt at (6,4) and (7,4) is not adjacent to me.  

I need to move to a dirt cell to clean it.  

- (7,4) is directly above (7,5) → I can move down to (7,4) to clean it.  
- (6,4) is not adjacent to (7,5) → requires going left or up first.  

Best immediate action: **move down to (7,4)** to clean dirt.  

After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn on adjacent land.  

**Action: down** (to reach (7,4) and clean dirt).  

Reasoning: Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning. I must first clean dirt adjacent to me. Moving down to (
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,6). Agent 1 at (7,5).
  Thinking: At (8,6), I am currently on a cell. I need to assess whether there's dirt or an apple here to take action.

- If there's dirt, I can clean it (clean action) — this doesn't give points, but it helps the river become cleaner, which increases the chance of apples spawning elsewhere.
- If there's an apple, I can eat it (+1.0 point).
- I cannot act on items not in my current cell.

Since the state doesn't specify whether (8,6) has dirt or an apple, and I don’t have visibility of the broader grid or river cleanliness, I must assume:

- Without confirmation of apple presence, I cannot safely eat.
- Without confirmation of dirt, I cannot clean.

But the key rule: **Apples only spawn when the river is clean**. So, if the river is not clean (i.e., there's dirt), no apples appear. Cleaning dirt enables apple spawning.

Agent 1 is at (7,5), which might imply activity nearby, but that doesn't directly help unless we know their actions.

**Best action:**  
→ **Stay** at (8,6) to assess the current cell. If there's dirt, I can clean it later
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Dirt at (6,0).
  Thinking: You are at (8,0). Dirt is at (6,0), which is to your left.  

You cannot clean dirt unless you are on the same cell as the dirt. So, to clean the dirt at (6,0), you must move to (6,0).  

Cleaning dirt gives no points, but it is necessary to make apples spawn on land. Once the river is clean (i.e., no dirt), apples can spawn — but only on land cells.  

Currently, there are no apples visible, and apples only spawn when the river is clean. Since dirt is present at (6,0), the river is not clean yet.  

Action: **left** to move to (6,0) to clean the dirt.  

After cleaning, the dirt is gone, and the river becomes clean — enabling apples to spawn on land. Then, you can move to a land cell with an apple to eat it and gain points.  

**Next step: left → clean → then move to a land cell with an apple (if available).**  

**Reasoning:** Cleaning dirt is required to enable apple spawning. Without cleaning, no apples can appear. You must first clean the dirt at (6,0) to progress.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (5,2), nothing is visible. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first determine if there's dirt to clean. With no visible items, I cannot eat an apple.  

Action: **clean** (if dirt is present), or **stay** to assess further. But since nothing is visible, I cannot confirm dirt.  

Best course: **stay** to maintain position and wait for new information or possible dirt to appear.  

→ **stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,8). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (5,8), nothing is visible. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first check if there's dirt to clean. Without any visible items, I cannot eat an apple.  

**Action: stay**  
Reasoning: No visible items mean no apples to eat. Cleaning dirt is necessary for apples to spawn, but without knowing if dirt exists, I cannot perform it. Staying safe and assessing the environment is the best first step. If dirt appears later, I can clean it. If apples spawn, I can eat them.  

→ **Stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately.  

First, check if there's dirt nearby to clean — but since nothing is visible, assume no dirt is present. Without dirt, apples won’t spawn.  

Action: **stay**  
Reason: No visible items to act on. Moving might reveal something, but without information, staying is safest. If dirt appears later, you can clean it to enable apple spawning.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (5,2), nothing is visible. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first check if there's dirt to clean. Without any visible items, I cannot eat an apple.  

Action: **clean** (if dirt is present) — but since nothing is visible, I cannot confirm.  

However, since nothing is visible and I'm at (5,2), it's safest to **stay** to avoid moving into unknown areas and to assess the situation further.  

Final action: **stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,8). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (5,8), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately.  

**Reasoning**: To eat apples, the river must be clean (i.e., dirt must be removed), and apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Since you currently see nothing, you must first explore to find dirt to clean or apples to eat.  

**Next step**: Move in a direction to explore the surroundings (e.g., up, down, left, right) to locate dirt or apples.  

→ **Action: up** (to explore)
  Decision: 'up' -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first determine if there's dirt to clean.  

However, with nothing in view, it's likely that either:  
- You're on clean land (no dirt to clean), or  
- There's dirt not visible yet (possibly off-screen).  

But since apples require clean river (dirt cleaned), and you can only clean dirt *on your current cell*, if there's no dirt here, you can't clean or spawn apples.  

**Best action: stay**  
→ To assess the situation further. If you move, you might find dirt or apples. But with nothing visible, moving risks missing a critical detail.  

**Conclusion: stay**  
Reason: No visible dirt or apples; cannot eat or clean without action. Staying allows you to reassess.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (5,2), nothing is visible. Since there are no apples or dirt visible, I cannot eat or clean immediately.  

First, I need to explore the environment to find dirt (to clean) or apples (to eat).  

Action: **right**  
→ Move to (6,2) to check surroundings.  

Reasoning: Exploration is essential. Without seeing anything, I can't act. Moving right is a safe, low-risk step to gather information.
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,8). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (5,8), nothing is visible. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first check if there's dirt to clean. Without any visible items, I cannot eat an apple.  

Action: **stay**  
Reasoning: I need to assess the surroundings or detect dirt before cleaning. Since nothing is visible, staying allows me to remain in position and possibly detect changes or receive updated info. Moving without information could lead to wasted actions.

Action: **stay**  
Reason: Without any visible items or information about the environment, I cannot safely perform *clean* or *eat*. Staying allows me to assess the situation further. If something appears later, I can act accordingly.

--- Step 41 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,2). Dirt at (8,2).
  Thinking: At (6,2), you are not on dirt, so you cannot clean it yet. Dirt is at (8,2), which is to your right. To clean dirt, you must move to (8,2) first.

**Action: right**  
→ Move to (8,2) to clean the dirt.

After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner (dirt reduced), which may enable apples to spawn — though apples only spawn *on land* when the river is clean. Since you're now on dirt, you can't eat an apple yet.

But cleaning is necessary to enable apple spawning. So, after cleaning, you should check if apples have appeared on land (not on dirt). If apples appear, you can then move to eat them.

**Next step after cleaning:** Check for apples on land (non-dirt cells) — if any, move to eat them.

**Current reasoning:** Move right to clean dirt. Then check for apples.  

✅ Action: **right**

Agent 2 (Low-Level):

--- Step 13 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,4). Dirt at (6,4), (7,4).
  Thinking: At (7,4), you are on a cell with dirt. There's also dirt at (6,4).  

You can:
- **Clean** the dirt at (7,4) → this will remove dirt from your cell, but gives no points.
- **Eat** only if there's an apple — currently, no apple is mentioned, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt). Since there's still dirt, no apples are present.

**Action: clean**  
Reasoning: Cleaning dirt is necessary to make the environment clean enough for apples to spawn. Since apples only appear when the river is clean (less dirt), cleaning the dirt at (7,4) is essential. After cleaning, you can potentially enable apple spawning in the future.  

→ **Action: clean**
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,6). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,6), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first determine if there's dirt to clean.

However, with nothing in view, it's likely that either:
- There is no dirt at (8,6), or
- The dirt is not visible due to distance or obstruction.

Since cleaning dirt gives no points directly but is necessary to enable apple spawning, and you can only act on what you're currently on, the best first step is to **check your surroundings**.

But since you can't see anything, and no action is possible without visibility, the safest assumption is: **you are on a clean cell with no dirt or apples**.

Therefore, **you cannot eat** (no apple), and **you cannot clean** (no dirt).

Best action: **stay** — to maintain position and possibly observe future changes or receive updates.

✅ **Action: stay**  
Reason: No visible dirt or apples. Cleaning or eating is not possible. Staying allows for potential future changes or movement when more information becomes available.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Dirt at (6,0).
  Thinking: At (7,0), you are adjacent to dirt at (6,0). Since you can only clean dirt if you are on the same cell, you **cannot clean the dirt at (6,0)** from (7,0).  

To clean dirt, you must move to a cell with dirt (e.g., move left to (6,0)), then clean it.  

**Action: left**  
→ Move to (6,0), now on dirt.  
→ Then clean it.  

Cleaning dirt enables more apples to spawn on land (since the river becomes cleaner). After cleaning, you can move back to (7,0) or explore further.  

**Reasoning:** Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning, even though it gives no points. Without cleaning, no apples will appear.  

✅ Best next step: **left** to clean dirt at (6,0).

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,4). Dirt at (6,4).
  Thinking: You are at (7,4). There is dirt at (6,4), which is directly to your left.  

Since you can only clean dirt or eat apples **at your current position**, you cannot clean the dirt at (6,4) from (7,4).  

Therefore, the only action you can take now is:  
→ **move left** to (6,4) to clean the dirt there.  

**Reasoning:** Cleaning dirt is necessary to make apples spawn (and thus allow you to eat them), but it only gives points if you clean dirt *at your position*. Since dirt is at (6,4), you must move there to clean it.  

**Next action: left**.
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,6). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,6), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately.  

**Reasoning:**  
- To eat apples, there must be an apple on the land, which only spawns when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned).  
- You can only clean dirt or eat apples if you are on a cell with dirt or an apple.  
- With nothing visible, it's likely the current cell is empty or has no dirt/apples.  

**Action: stay**  
Waiting might allow you to detect changes (e.g., dirt or apples appearing) or move to a better position. Without information, staying is safe and allows monitoring.

After cleaning, you can then consider moving to explore or eat apples if they spawn.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,4). Dirt at (6,4).
  Thinking: You are at (6,4), and there is dirt at your position.  

Action: **clean**  
Reasoning: You can only eat apples when there is clean land, and apples only spawn on clean land. Since you are currently on dirt, you must clean it first to make space for apples. Cleaning dirt gives no points directly, but it is necessary to enable apple spawning.  

After cleaning, you will be on clean land at (6,4), which may allow apples to spawn (depending on river cleanliness). Then, if apples appear, you can eat them for +1.0 points.  

Next step: After cleaning, consider whether to stay and wait for apples or move to explore other areas. But currently, the best action is: **clean**.
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,6). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,6), nothing is visible. Since there are no apples or dirt visible, I cannot eat or clean immediately.  

First, I need to explore the environment to find dirt (to clean) or apples (to eat).  

**Action: right**  
→ Move to (9,6) to check surroundings.  

Reasoning: Without any visible items, movement is necessary to discover dirt or apples. Cleaning dirt enables apple spawning, and apples give points. Without exploration, no action yields points.  

Next step: explore.  
→ **right**
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To get apples, you first need to clean dirt to make the river clean (which enables apple spawning). However, without seeing dirt or apples, you must explore.

**Action: left**  
Reason: Moving left from (6,0) might reveal dirt or other terrain. Since apples only spawn on clean land, and cleaning dirt is necessary, exploration is required before any action. Starting with a directional move to gather information is logical.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,4). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,4), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and you can only eat or clean what's directly at your position, you must first check if there's dirt to clean or an apple to eat.

But since nothing is visible, it's possible that your cell is empty (no dirt, no apple). In that case:

- You cannot eat (no apple).
- You cannot clean (no dirt).

Thus, the best action is to **stay** — explore further or wait for a change in state. Moving might reveal something, but without any information, moving risks missing a valuable opportunity.

**Action: stay**.
  Obs: You at (5,8). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (5,8), nothing is visible, so I don't know if there's dirt or an apple. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points, I must first check if there's dirt to clean.  

But with no visible items, I cannot confirm whether dirt exists. Therefore, **I should stay** to assess the situation further—maybe dirt is adjacent, or I can move to gain visibility.  

**Action: stay**.  

(Reasoning: Without knowing if dirt is present, I cannot clean or eat. Staying allows me to evaluate the environment safely and make informed decisions.)

Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apple spawning, the river must be clean—so dirt must be cleaned. However, you can only clean dirt that is on your current cell.

Since nothing is visible, it's likely your cell (6,0) is either clean or has no dirt. Without confirmation, you cannot assume dirt is present.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: You cannot confirm dirt or apples are present. Staying allows you to assess the situation further. If dirt is later detected, you can clean it. If apples appear, you can eat them. Moving now without information risks missing opportunities.

  Obs: You at (7,2). Dirt at (8,2).
  Thinking: You are at (7,2). There is dirt at (8,2), which is to your right.  

Action: **right**  
→ Move to (8,2) to clean the dirt.  

Reasoning: You can only clean dirt or eat apples at your current position. Since there's dirt at (8,2) and you're at (7,2), you must move there to clean it. Cleaning dirt is necessary to improve the river's cleanliness, which in turn enables apples to spawn. While cleaning itself gives no points, it's a prerequisite for apples to appear. After cleaning, you can then potentially move to areas with apples (if they spawn).  

Next step: After cleaning, assess if apples have appeared (though spawning depends on overall river cleanliness, which isn't fully visible here).  

Current best action: **right**.

Action: **stay**  
Reason: I need to assess the environment first. Without visibility, I can't safely clean or eat. Staying allows me to gather more information or wait for a change in state. If dirt appears later, I can act. Otherwise, I remain to avoid wasting actions.

Action: **stay**  
Reasoning: I need to assess my surroundings first. Staying in place allows me to gather more information—perhaps later actions (like moving or cleaning) can be taken once I know if there's dirt or apples nearby. Without visibility, moving blindly risks missing key actions. Stay to maintain position and wait for further insight.

  Thinking: You are at (8,2), and there is dirt at your position.  

Action: **clean**  
Reason: You can only eat apples when there is clean land, and apples spawn only on clean land. Since you are currently on dirt, you must clean it first to make space for apples. Cleaning dirt gives no points directly, but it is necessary to enable apple spawning.  

After cleaning, you will be on clean land at (8,2), and then you can consider eating an apple if one spawns.  

→ **Action: clean**
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,8). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (5,8), nothing is visible, so I don't know if there's dirt or an apple. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first check the surroundings.

However, with no visible items, I cannot confirm if there's dirt to clean or an apple to eat. Without information about adjacent cells or the state of the environment, I cannot take action safely.

**Best action: stay**  
Reason: I don’t know if there’s dirt or an apple. Moving could lead to missing a clean opportunity or wasting steps. Staying allows me to assess the situation or wait for new information.  

→ **Action: stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean yet. To progress, you must first check your surroundings to locate dirt (to clean) or apples (to eat). 

However, since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is removed), cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning. But currently, there's nothing visible.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: You cannot act meaningfully without seeing dirt or apples. Staying allows you to remain in position and potentially detect changes or receive updated environmental information (e.g., if dirt or apples appear after cleaning elsewhere). Without visibility, moving might lead to wasted effort.  

**Next step**: Wait for new information or explore adjacent cells if possible. But currently, with nothing visible, **stay** is the safest and most logical choice.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,2), nothing is visible, so I don't know if there's dirt or an apple. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first check if there's dirt to clean.

However, with no visible items, I cannot confirm whether dirt is present. Without knowing the state of the cell, I cannot safely clean or eat.

Best action: **stay** — to remain at (8,2) and assess the situation further. If anything appears (like dirt or an apple), I can act accordingly.  

**Reasoning**: No information available to act on cleaning or eating. Staying is safe and allows for future observation.

--- Step 50 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 2). You see dirt at (8, 1) and dirt at (6, 2).
  Thinking: I am at (6, 2), which is both my current position and the location of dirt. The global scan shows that the nearest apple is at (3, 1), which is 4 steps away — a reasonable distance but not immediate. However, there is no apple currently visible at my position, and the only dirt I see is at (6, 2), which is where I currently am.

Let’s analyze the trade-offs:

1. **Eating an apple for immediate reward**:  
   There is no apple at (6, 2). The nearest apple is at (3, 1), which requires movement. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), and we currently have dirt at (6, 2), apples are not spawning yet. Therefore, eating an apple is not possible right now. Attempting to move toward (3, 1) without first cleaning the dirt at (6, 2) would be futile — apples won’t appear until dirt is removed.

2. **Cleaning dirt to enable future apple spawning**:  
   The dirt at (6, 2) is directly adjacent to me. Cleaning it is a logical first step. Removing dirt is not rewarding immediately,
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 2}} -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (5, 4). You see nothing of interest nearby.
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 2) before considering eating an apple.

Reasoning:

- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. This means that cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for apple spawning — without it, no apples will appear, regardless of how far or how many apples are visible.
- The nearest dirt is at (6, 2), which is only 3 units away from my current position (5, 4). This is a very short and feasible journey.
- The nearest apple is at (3, 1), which is 5 units away — a longer path and not immediately accessible without first ensuring the river is clean.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 point, but if the river remains dirty, no future apples will spawn. This would permanently deprive the group of potential rewards.
- Since the goal is to *maximize points* over time (not just immediate gain), and cleaning dirt enables future apple spawning (which benefits the group), it's a more strategic long-term move.
- There is no immediate danger or obstacle — the dirt is within reach, and I can move in valid directions (up/down/left/right).

Therefore, I should move to (6, 2) to
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 2}} -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (12, 6). You see an apple at (12, 7).
  Thinking: I should eat the apple at (12, 7).

Here's the reasoning:

- The apple is immediately available and only 1 step away — this is a direct, tangible reward (+1.0 point) with no risk or cost.
- The nearest dirt is at (8, 1), which is 9 steps away. Cleaning it would require significant movement and time, and there is no immediate benefit from doing so — apples only spawn when the river is clean, which is a long-term, indirect benefit.
- Since there is no current dirt nearby that is critical to the immediate environment, and we are already in a position where apples are spawning (an apple is visible), there is no urgent need to clean dirt now.
- The game mechanics suggest that cleaning dirt enables future apple spawning, but without a clear indication that apples are currently not spawning or that the river is polluted, the immediate action should prioritize reward.
- In a cleanup game, the goal is to maximize points — and eating an apple directly contributes to that. Delaying this action for a long-term, uncertain benefit reduces immediate efficiency.

Therefore, the optimal action is to eat the apple at (12, 7) — it provides immediate, verifiable reward with zero cost, and it

Evaluating Method: LOW_LEVEL...

============================================================
SAMPLE TRAJECTORY: LOW_LEVEL
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (9,6). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (9,6), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately.  

**Reasoning:**  
- To eat an apple, there must be one on the ground — which only spawns when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is reduced).  
- You can only clean dirt or eat apples if you are on a cell with dirt or an apple.  
- With nothing visible, it's likely you're on clean land or on a cell without dirt or apples.  

**Best action: stay**  
You cannot move effectively without information. Staying allows you to monitor the environment and wait for changes (e.g., dirt or apples appearing).  

→ **Action: stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (5,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To progress, you must first explore to find dirt (to clean) or apples (to eat). 

**Action: right**  
Reason: Moving right from (5,0) increases the chance of encountering dirt or apples in the next cell. Without any visible items, exploration is essential. Cleaning dirt enables apple spawning, and apples grant points. Start by moving to gather information.  

**Next step:** After moving, check if dirt or apples appear. Only then consider cleaning or eating.  

**Goal:** Clean dirt to enable apple spawning, then eat apples to gain points.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,4). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,4), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately.  

**Reasoning:**  
- To eat apples, there must be an apple on the ground — which only spawns when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned).  
- Since you see nothing, there’s no apple to eat.  
- You also don’t know if there’s dirt to clean.  

**Best action: stay**  
Staying allows you to monitor your position and possibly detect changes (e.g., dirt or apples appearing later). Moving randomly might miss opportunities.  

→ **Action: stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (9,6). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (9,6), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately.  

First, you need to explore to find dirt (to clean) or apples (to eat). Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first check adjacent cells to see if there's dirt to clean.  

Action: **left** (to (8,6)) — explore to find dirt or other items.  

Reasoning: Without any visible items, movement is necessary to discover dirt or apples. Cleaning dirt enables apple spawning, which gives points. Eating apples gives +1.0 each, so exploration is essential. Start by moving left to investigate.
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first check if there's dirt to clean. However, with nothing in view, it's unclear whether dirt exists at your current position.

Action: **clean**  
Reason: Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning. Without cleaning, apples won’t appear. Even though cleaning gives no points, it’s a prerequisite for earning points by eating apples later. Since nothing is visible, it’s safest to assume there might be dirt — and cleaning is required to unlock apple spawning.

--- Step 18 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,4). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,4), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apple spawning, you must first clean dirt. However, without knowing what’s around you, you can't act.  

Best next step: **move** to a neighboring cell to explore and check for dirt or apples.  

Action: **right** (to (7,4)) — explore adjacent area to find dirt to clean and possibly apples.
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,6). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,6), nothing is visible. Since there are no apples or dirt visible, I cannot eat or clean immediately.  

**Reasoning:**  
- To eat apples, the river must be clean (i.e., dirt must be cleaned), and apples only spawn on clean land.  
- Since I don’t see any dirt or apples, I need to explore first.  
- Without knowing the state of the surrounding cells, I cannot safely clean or eat.  

**Action: left**  
→ Move to (7,6) to explore adjacent area and check for dirt or apples.  

(Exploration is essential before cleaning or eating.)
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,0), nothing is visible. Since there are no apples or dirt visible, I cannot eat or clean immediately. To progress, I need to explore the environment to find dirt (to clean) or apples (to eat).  

First, I should **move** to check surrounding cells. The best next step is to **move left or right** to explore adjacent areas. Since the river's cleanliness affects apple spawning, and apples only appear on clean land, I need to find dirt first to clean it and possibly enable apple growth.  

Action: **left** (to check (5,0))  

Reason: Exploring adjacent cells is essential to find dirt or apples. Without movement, no progress can be made.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,4). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,4), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately.  

**Reasoning:**  
- To eat apples, the river must be clean (i.e., dirt must be cleaned), and apples only spawn on land when the river is clean.  
- You currently have no information about dirt or apples nearby.  
- Since you can only act on your current cell, and there's nothing visible, you must first investigate.  

**Action: stay**  
(To remain in place and assess the situation further—possibly detect dirt or apples in future steps, or wait for environmental changes.)  

→ **Final action: stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,6). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,6), nothing is visible. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first check if there's dirt to clean. Without any visible items, I cannot eat an apple.  

Action: **stay**  
Reason: I need to assess the environment further. Without knowing if there's dirt or apples nearby, I cannot act productively. Staying allows me to monitor the situation or potentially detect changes if the game updates the view.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (5,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first determine if there's dirt to clean.

However, with nothing in view, it's uncertain whether dirt exists at your current position. Without dirt, you cannot clean it, and thus no apples can spawn. 

**Action: stay**  
Reason: I need to assess the current cell state before acting. Staying allows me to evaluate if there's dirt to clean or an apple to eat. Without visibility, I cannot take any action safely.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apples to spawn, the river must be clean—so dirt must be cleaned. However, you need to know where dirt is to clean it. With no visible items, it's likely that dirt is not currently in your vicinity.

Action: **stay**  
Reason: You have no information about nearby dirt or apples. Moving without knowing the environment risks missing opportunities. Staying allows you to assess the situation or wait for new information. If dirt appears later, you can act accordingly. Cleaning is only useful if dirt is present, and without visibility, it's not safe to assume it's there.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,2), nothing is visible. Since there are no apples or dirt visible, I cannot eat or clean immediately.  

First, I need to explore the surroundings to find dirt (to clean) or apples (to eat).  

Action: **left** → move to (7,2) to explore.  

Reasoning: Without any visible items, movement is necessary to discover dirt or apples. Cleaning dirt enables apple spawning, and apples give points. I must explore to find actionable elements.
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,8). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (5,8), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apples to spawn, you must first clean dirt. However, without knowing if there's dirt at your current position, you can't act.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: You need to check your current cell for dirt before cleaning. Staying allows you to assess whether dirt is present and whether cleaning is possible. Without knowing the state of the cell, moving or acting prematurely risks missing a chance to clean and eventually eat apples.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,0), nothing is visible, so I don't know if there's dirt or an apple. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points, I must first check if there's dirt to clean.

But since I have no view and nothing is visible, I cannot determine the state of the cell or surroundings.  

**Action: stay**  
Reason: Without visibility, I cannot safely clean dirt or eat an apple. Staying allows me to assess the situation further—perhaps future information will reveal dirt or apples. I cannot act without knowing what's at my current position.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,2), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately.  

**Reasoning**: To eat apples, the river must be clean (i.e., dirt must be cleaned), and apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Since you currently see nothing, there's no immediate apple or dirt to act upon.  

**Next step**: Move to a nearby cell to investigate (e.g., check adjacent areas) to see if there's dirt or an apple.  

**Action**: *right* (to explore (7,3))
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,8). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (5,8), nothing is visible, so I don't know if there's dirt or an apple. Since I can only clean dirt or eat apples when on a cell, and there's no indication of either, I should **stay** to assess the situation further. Moving without information could lead to wasted actions.  

**Action: stay**.

  Thinking: At (6,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first determine if there's dirt to clean.

However, with nothing in view, it's likely that your current cell (6,0) is either clean or has no dirt. Without direct observation, you can't confirm.

**Best action: stay**  
Because you cannot see any dirt or apples, and cleaning only gives no points but is necessary for apples to spawn, you cannot safely clean without knowing if dirt is present. Moving without information risks missing a potential apple spawn opportunity.

→ **Stay** to assess the situation further.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,2), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apples to spawn, you must first clean dirt. However, without knowing the state of the surrounding cells (dirt or land), you can't assume anything.

Action: **stay**  
Reasoning: You need to gather more information about your surroundings. Staying in place allows you to assess whether dirt or apples are nearby. If you move without knowing the terrain, you might miss opportunities or waste actions. Stay to observe or prepare for a potential clean action once you detect dirt.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,8). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (5,8), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you cannot eat anything yet.

Action: **clean**  
Reason: Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning. Since you're at (5,8) and see nothing, it's likely there is dirt (or potential dirt) in your cell. Cleaning it will make the area clean, which may allow apples to spawn later. Without cleaning, no apples can appear.  

Next step: After cleaning, monitor for apple spawns. Then, if apples appear, you can eat them.  

✅ Action: **clean**
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first check if there's dirt to clean. Without sight of anything, you cannot confirm if dirt is present.

However, since you are at (6,0), and nothing is visible, the safest and most logical first step is to **clean** if dirt is present. But since you can't see it, you cannot be certain.

But the rule says: *You can only eat/clean items at your position.* And *cleaning dirt gives no points, but is necessary for apples to spawn.*

So, **if there is dirt at (6,0)**, cleaning it will enable future apple spawning. If not, you can't eat or clean anything.

Given the lack of visibility, and the necessity of cleaning to spawn apples, the best action is:

👉 **clean**

This ensures you're making progress toward enabling apple spawning, even if you don't see anything. It's a necessary step before eating.

**Action: clean** ✅

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,2), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apples to spawn, the river must be clean—so dirt must be cleaned. However, you need to know if there's dirt to clean or if apples are nearby.

Since nothing is visible and you're at (8,2), the safest next step is to **explore** to check the surroundings. 

**Action: left**

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,5). Dirt at (7,6), (7,4).
  Thinking: At (5,5), I am not on any dirt, so I can't clean yet. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — currently, there's dirt at (7,6) and (7,4), so the river is not clean. To enable apples to spawn, I must clean the dirt.

The closest dirt is at (7,6) and (7,4). I need to move to one of those positions to clean it.

Let’s consider moving to (7,6):  
- From (5,5) → (6,5) → (7,5) → (7,6)  
That’s 3 moves.

Or to (7,4):  
- (5,5) → (6,5) → (6,4) → (7,4)  
Also 3 moves.

Either way, it takes 3 moves to reach a dirt cell. Cleaning gives no points, but enables apple spawning. After cleaning, if apples spawn on land (which they will if the river is clean), I can eat them for +1.0 each.

Since I can only eat apples when on land and the river is clean, I should first clean dirt to enable apples.

  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (9,7). Dirt at (7,8), (7,6).
  Thinking: At (9,7), you are not on any dirt, so you can't clean. There's no apple visible at your position.  

Dirt is at (7,8) and (7,6) — both are far from you. To access them, you'd need to move left or up/down to reach those cells.  

But: **Apples only spawn when the river is clean** — meaning dirt must be cleaned. Cleaning dirt gives no points, but enables apples to spawn.  

Since you can't eat an apple now (no apple at (9,7)), and cleaning dirt gives no points, **you should move toward the dirt to clean it**.  

Best action: **left** to move toward (7,8) and (7,6).  

→ **Action: left**  
(Reason: Cleaning dirt is necessary to spawn apples; you must reach it to clean it.)
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (9,0). Dirt at (8,1), (8,0).
  Thinking: At (9,0), you are adjacent to dirt at (8,0) and (8,1). You cannot eat an apple yet because there are no apples visible, and apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned).  

Since you are at (9,0), you can only clean dirt if you are on a cell with dirt. You are not on (8,0) or (8,1), so you cannot clean them directly.  

**Action: move left to (8,0)**  
- Now you are on (8,0), which has dirt.  
- You can now **clean** the dirt at (8,0).  

After cleaning (8,0), the dirt is removed, which may help the river become cleaner, potentially enabling apple spawning on adjacent land.  

**Next step**: After cleaning, check if apples can now spawn (e.g., at (8,1) or nearby). If apples appear, you can then eat them.  

**Current best action: left, then clean**.  

→ **Action: left**

--- Step 2 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,5). Dirt at (7,6), (8,5), (7,4).
  Thinking: At (6,5), I see dirt at (7,6), (8,5), and (7,4). I am not on any dirt, so I cannot clean it directly. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning I need to clean dirt to enable apple spawning.

Currently, I can only clean dirt if I am on a cell with dirt. I am at (6,5), which is not on any dirt cells. So I must move to a dirt cell to clean it.

Looking at the dirt positions:
- (7,6): reachable from (6,6) or (7,5) or (8,6)
- (8,5): adjacent to (6,5) → directly down one step
- (7,4): reachable from (6,4), (7,3), etc.

The closest dirt cell is (8,5), which is directly below me (down from (6,5) → (7,5) → (8,5)) — so I need to move down to (7,5), then to (8,5).

But I can only clean when on a dirt cell. So optimal plan:

1. Move down to (7,5
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,7). Dirt at (6,8), (7,8), (7,6).
  Thinking: At (8,7), you are not on any dirt cells. Dirt is at (6,8), (7,8), (7,6) — all of which are not adjacent to your current position.  

To eat an apple, the river must be clean (i.e., dirt must be removed), and apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Since you're not on dirt, you can't clean it directly.  

Possible moves:  
- Move to a nearby cell to get closer to dirt (e.g., (7,7), (8,8), (8,6)) — but none of these are dirt cells.  
- You can only clean dirt if you are on a dirt cell.  

Currently, no dirt is adjacent to (8,7), so you cannot clean anything. Therefore, **you cannot eat an apple** yet.  

**Action: move left to (7,7)** — to get closer to (7,8) and (7,6), which are dirt cells. From there, you might be able to clean dirt if you reach one.  

**Reasoning:** Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning, and you must be on a dirt cell to clean it. You are currently
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Dirt at (8,1), (6,0), (8,0).
  Thinking: You are at (8,0).  
Dirt is at (8,1), (6,0), and (8,0) — so there's dirt on your current cell.

**Action analysis:**
- You can **clean** dirt only if you are on a cell with dirt.  
- Cleaning dirt gives **no points**, but it's necessary to allow apples to spawn later.  
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be removed from areas that affect the river (likely the cells adjacent to water or the path).  
- Currently, you are at (8,0), which has dirt.  

**Best action:**  
→ **clean** (because you're on a dirt cell and cleaning is required to enable future apple spawning).  

After cleaning (8,0), the dirt is gone. Then, you can assess whether apples are now possible — but apples only spawn *after* the river is clean. Since (8,1) still has dirt, and it may be adjacent to the river, you may need to clean that too.  

**Next step:** Move to (8,1) and clean it.  

But for now — **you must clean the dirt on your current cell to

--- Step 3 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Dirt at (7,6), (8,5), (7,4).
  Thinking: At (7,5), you can see dirt at (7,6), (8,5), and (7,4). You are not on any dirt, so you cannot clean yet. Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. Since you are at (7,5), you can only clean dirt that is adjacent to you.

- (7,6) is directly above you → can clean
- (8,5) is to your right → can clean
- (7,4) is directly below you → can clean

But you can only clean one cell at a time. Since you are at (7,5), you can **clean (7,6)**, **(8,5)**, or **(7,4)** — each will reduce dirt and potentially enable apple spawning.

However, **eating apples gives +1.0 points**, and **cleaning gives 0 points**. So cleaning is only useful to enable apple spawning.

Currently, there is no apple visible. Apples spawn only when dirt is cleaned and the river is clean — so we need to clean dirt first.

**Best move: clean (7,6)** — it's directly above you, and removing it will
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,7). Dirt at (6,8), (7,8), (7,6).
  Thinking: At (7,7), I see dirt at (6,8), (7,8), and (7,6). I am not on any dirt, so I cannot clean it yet. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning I need to clean the dirt to enable apple spawning.

Since I can only clean dirt if I'm on the same cell, I must move to one of the dirt cells to clean them.

- (7,6) is directly below me — move down to (7,6)
- (7,8) is directly above me — move up to (7,8)
- (6,8) is up-left — farther, less efficient

Best first move: **down to (7,6)** — clean it (no points, but necessary). Then I can assess the next steps.

After cleaning (7,6), I can then move to (7,8) or (6,8) to clean those. But I must clean all dirt to make land available for apples.

But I only get points for eating apples, not cleaning. So the goal is: clean dirt → enable apples → eat apples.

Reasoning: Since nothing is visible and no dirt or apples are present, moving would risk missing a potential opportunity. Staying allows you to assess the environment further—perhaps dirt or apples will become visible if you observe more carefully. Also, cleaning requires being on a cell with dirt, which isn't confirmed. Thus, staying is the safest and most strategic initial step.

--- Step 20 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,4). Dirt at (8,3).
  Thinking: At (7,4), you are not on dirt, so you can't clean it directly. Dirt is at (8,3), which is adjacent but not currently accessible.  

To eat an apple, the river must be clean (i.e., dirt must be cleaned). Since dirt is at (8,3), you need to move there first to clean it.  

Best action: **move right to (8,4)**, then **move down to (8,3)** to clean the dirt.  

After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner, enabling apple spawning (though apples may not spawn immediately). Then, you can move to a land cell with an apple to eat it.  

**Immediate action: right** (to get closer to (8,3)).  

→ **Action: right**
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,6). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,6), nothing is visible. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first check if there's dirt to clean. Without sight, I cannot determine if there's dirt or an apple.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: I cannot safely assume there's dirt or an apple. Moving without information risks missing a clean opportunity or wandering into a barren area. Staying allows me to assess the situation better—perhaps a future observation or action will reveal dirt or apples.  

Wait: The prompt says "nothing in your view," so no immediate items. Therefore, I cannot eat or clean.  

**Final action: stay**  
Reason: No visible items; cannot eat or clean. Staying is safe and enables future observation.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (5,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first determine if there's dirt to clean.

However, with nothing in view, it's likely that you're on a clean cell or there's no immediate dirt. Without dirt, no apples can spawn, so eating is not possible.

**Action: stay**  
Reasoning: There's nothing visible, so moving would be unnecessary. Staying allows you to monitor the environment for changes or potential dirt that might appear. If dirt appears later, you can act accordingly. Cleaning is only beneficial if dirt is present, which isn't currently visible.  

**Next step:** Wait and observe. If dirt appears, clean it to enable apple spawning.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,4). Dirt at (8,3).
  Thinking: You are at (8,4). There is dirt at (8,3), directly below you.  

Since you can only clean dirt when you are on the same cell as the dirt, you must **move down to (8,3)** to clean it.  

Cleaning dirt gives no points, but it's necessary because apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. After cleaning, the area will be cleaner, potentially allowing apples to spawn (though no apples are currently visible).  

**Action: down**  
Then, after cleaning, you can assess if apples appear. But right now, only cleaning is possible.  

✅ Reasoning: You must move to the dirt cell to clean it. Cleaning is required to enable future apple spawning. No points are gained from cleaning, but it's essential for enabling apple growth.  

**Next step: down**
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,6). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,6), nothing is visible. Since there are no apples or dirt visible, I cannot eat or clean immediately.  

First, I need to explore the environment to find dirt (to clean) or apples (to eat).  

Action: **right**  
→ Move to (8,6) to explore adjacent cells.  

Reasoning: Without any visible items, movement is necessary to discover dirt or apples. Cleaning dirt enables apple spawning, and apples give points. Exploration is essential.
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (5,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apples to spawn, the river must be clean—meaning dirt must be cleaned. However, cleaning dirt gives no points, only enables apple spawning.

Since you're at (5,0) and see nothing, it's likely your surroundings are currently barren or the river is dirty. Without dirt to clean or apples to eat, the best first step is to **explore** to find dirt or apples.

Action: **right** (to explore the area and potentially find dirt or apples).  

Reasoning: You need to locate dirt to clean and eventually apples to eat. Without movement, you can’t find anything. Exploring is essential to progress.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,3). Dirt at (8,3), (7,2).
  Thinking: At (8,3), there is dirt on your cell.  
There is also dirt at (7,2), but that is not currently accessible.

**Action: clean**

Reasoning: You can only clean dirt if you are on the cell with dirt. Since you are at (8,3) and there is dirt there, cleaning it will remove the dirt and possibly enable apple spawning (since apples spawn on land when the river is clean). Cleaning gives no points directly, but it's necessary to allow apples to spawn later.  

After cleaning (8,3), you can then consider moving to check for apples or other dirt.  

✅ Action: clean
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,6). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,6), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first determine whether there's dirt to clean.

But since nothing is visible, it's possible that you're on clean land or on a cell with no dirt. Without dirt, apples cannot spawn. Therefore, to enable apple spawning, you need to **check your surroundings** to find dirt.

However, you can only act on your current cell. So:

- If there's dirt at (8,6), you can **clean** it (no points, but enables potential apple spawning).
- If there's no dirt, nothing to do — but apples won’t spawn anyway.

Since nothing is visible, it's safest to **clean** if dirt exists, but we don’t know. Since we can't see, and no action is specified, the best action is to **stay** and assess further — but we have no further information.

However, the only safe, informed action when nothing is visible and no dirt is known is to **clean** if possible — but since we don’t know if dirt exists, we can't assume.

Thus, **best action: stay**

Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first determine whether there's dirt to clean.

However, since nothing is visible and you're at (6,0), it's possible you're on a land cell with no dirt or apples currently. Without dirt, apples won't spawn.

**Best action: clean**  
→ Cleaning dirt gives no points directly, but it's necessary to enable future apple spawning. Since apples only appear when the river is clean, and you're at (6,0), cleaning dirt here might be required to eventually spawn apples.

**Reasoning**: Without cleaning, no apples can appear. You cannot eat an apple if there is none. Thus, cleaning is a necessary first step to enable apple spawning.

Currently, no apples are present (since dirt exists). So I must clean dirt

Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Dirt at (8,1), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (8,0), you see dirt at (8,1) and (6,0). You cannot eat an apple yet because there are no apples spawned — apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned).

Available actions:
- **clean**: You can clean dirt only if you are on the same cell as the dirt.
- **eat**: Only possible if an apple is on your cell — currently, no apples are present.

Currently:
- You are at (8,0).
- Dirt at (8,1) — you can **clean it** if you move to (8,1).
- Dirt at (6,0) — you are not on that cell, so you cannot clean it directly.

**Best action**: Move to (8,1) to clean the dirt there.

**Reasoning**: Cleaning dirt is necessary to make land clean, which enables apple spawning. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, cleaning dirt at (8,1) will help create conditions for apples to appear. After cleaning, you can potentially move around and eventually eat apples.

**Action: right** (to move from (8,0) to (8,1)) → then **clean**.

  Thinking: At (7,5), you see dirt at (7,6), (8,5), and (7,4). Agent 2 is at (7,6), which has dirt.  

You can only clean dirt or eat apples **at your current position**.  

- You are **not on any dirt cell**, so you cannot clean dirt directly.  
- There is **no apple** mentioned at (7,5), so you cannot eat one yet.  
- To spawn apples, the river must be clean — but apples only appear *on land* when the river is clean. Since dirt is present, apples are not spawning yet.  

**Action:** Clean the dirt at (7,6) — but you are not on (7,6). You can only clean dirt **on your current cell**.  

You are at (7,5). Dirt is at (7,6) and (8,5) — both adjacent. You can **move** to a dirt cell to clean it.  

Best move: **move up** to (6,5) — no dirt there.  
Or **move down** to (8,5) — dirt is there.

  Thinking: At (7,6), there is dirt, so I can clean it. Cleaning dirt doesn't give points, but it's necessary to enable apple spawning. After cleaning (7,6), the river becomes cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn. Currently, there's no apple visible, and apples only spawn on land when the river is clean.  

I must clean (7,6) first. After that, I can check if apples appear. Since I can only eat apples when on a cell with one, and no apple is mentioned, I should stay and clean.  

Action: **clean**.

Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (9,0). Dirt at (8,1).
  Thinking: At (9,0), you are not on any dirt. The dirt is at (8,1), which is adjacent but not directly under you.  

To clean dirt, you must be on the same cell as the dirt. Since you're at (9,0) and dirt is at (8,1), you cannot clean it directly.  

There are no apples mentioned, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned). Since dirt is not yet cleaned, no apples are present.  

Available actions:  
- Move to (8,1) to clean the dirt.  
- Otherwise, you can’t eat or clean anything.  

**Best action: move left to (8,0), then up to (8,1)** to clean the dirt.  

**Reasoning:** Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apples to spawn. Without cleaning, no apples exist, so no points can be earned. Moving to (8,1) to clean it is essential.  

✅ Action: **left → up** (to reach (8,1))  
Then: **clean**  

After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn later. Then you can move back and eat apples if available

However, cleaning dirt gives **no points**, and apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning you need to clean dirt to enable apple spawning.

Right now, there's dirt at (8,5) and (7,4). Since you're at (7,4), you can **clean** the dirt at your position immediately.

**Action: clean**  
→ This cleans the dirt at (7,4), contributing to a cleaner river.  
→ No points gained from cleaning, but necessary step to enable future apple spawning.

After cleaning, you may consider moving to investigate (8,5) or stay to monitor changes. But with no apples visible yet, and no indication of apple spawn conditions, **cleaning is the priority**.

**Final action: clean** ✅
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,6). Dirt at (8,5).
  Thinking: You are at (7,6). Dirt is at (8,5), which is not adjacent to your current position.  

To clean dirt, you must be on the same cell as the dirt. Since you're at (7,6) and the dirt is at (8,5), you cannot clean it directly.  

You cannot eat an apple either, because there's no apple mentioned, and apples only spawn when the river is clean — which requires cleaning dirt. Since no dirt is currently at your position, and you can't reach the dirt to clean it, no apples can spawn.  

**Action: stay**  
(No beneficial action is possible right now. You must move to reach the dirt to clean it, but that requires a path — and no movement options are given. Without movement, you can't progress.)  

→ **Best action: stay** (no point gain, but no risk — you're not in a position to act productively.)  

**Note:** To maximize points, you must first move to (8,5) to clean the dirt, which would enable apple spawning. But since movement is not specified, and you are currently not adjacent, you cannot act.  

**Final action: stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Dirt at (8,1), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (8,0), you see dirt at (8,1) and (6,0).  

- You **cannot eat an apple** right now because there are no apples visible, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned).  
- You **can clean dirt** only if you are on the same cell as the dirt.  
  - You are at (8,0), so you can **clean the dirt at (8,1)** only if you move to (8,1).  
  - Dirt at (6,0) is not adjacent — you'd need to move to (6,0) to clean it, which is two steps left.  

**Best action**: Move to (8,1) to clean the dirt there.  

After cleaning (8,1), the river becomes cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn later.  

**Action: right** → move to (8,1), then **clean**.  

✅ Reasoning: Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning. Eating apples gives points, but only when apples exist — which depends on clean land. So, prioritize cleaning adjacent dirt first.  

**Next step**: After cleaning (8,1), check

--- Step 6 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,4). Dirt at (6,5), (8,5).
  Thinking: At (7,4), you are not on any dirt, so you can't clean yet. Dirt is at (6,5) and (8,5), which are not adjacent to your current position. You must move to one of those dirt cells to clean.

To maximize points:
- Cleaning dirt enables apple spawning on land (which requires clean river).
- Apples give +1.0 each, but only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., after dirt is cleaned).

Since you can only clean dirt when you are on it, you must move to (6,5) or (8,5).

Let’s evaluate:
- (6,5) is left and up from (7,4).
- (8,5) is right and up from (7,4).

Either direction is possible. Both are equidistant and symmetric.

**Action: move right to (8,5)**  
→ Then clean dirt at (8,5)  
→ This cleans the river, enabling apples to spawn on land  
→ After cleaning, you can later move to land with apples and eat them

👉 Action: **clean**

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,3). Dirt at (7,2).
  Thinking: At (8,3), you are not on dirt, so you can't clean it directly. Dirt is at (7,2), which is not adjacent to your current position. You must move to (7,2) to clean it.  

**Action: move left to (7,3)**  
Then move down to (7,2) to clean the dirt.  

Cleaning dirt enables apple spawning on land, which may eventually allow you to eat apples. But since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt), and you’re currently not on dirt, no apples are available yet.  

**Best next step: move to (7,2) and clean the dirt.**  

→ **Action: left, then down, then clean**  

This improves the environment for future apple spawning. No points yet, but necessary progress.
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,6). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,6), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately.  

**Reasoning**: To eat apples, the river must be clean (i.e., dirt must be cleaned), and apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Since you currently see nothing, you must first explore to find dirt to clean or apples to eat.  

**Action**: **right** — move to explore the area and check for dirt or apples.  

(Next step: Once you find dirt, clean it; once you find apples, eat them.)
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately.  

**Reasoning**: To eat apples, the river must be clean (i.e., dirt must be cleaned), and apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Since you currently see nothing, it's likely that there is no dirt or apple at this position.  

**Next step**: Move to a position where you can see dirt or apples, or investigate nearby cells to find dirt to clean and eventually enable apple spawning.  

**Action**: *left* (to check (5,0)) — explore adjacent cells to find dirt or apples.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,3). Dirt at (7,2).
  Thinking: At (7,3), there is dirt at (7,2) directly below you. Since you can only clean dirt when you are on the same cell, you cannot clean (7,2) from (7,3). 

To clean dirt, you must move to (7,2) first. Once there, you can clean it. Cleaning dirt improves the river's cleanliness, which in turn enables apples to spawn on land — but cleaning itself gives no points.

Currently, there is no apple at (7,3), and no indication of apple spawning. So, the best action is:

**Move down to (7,2)** to clean the dirt.

After cleaning, the river will be cleaner, potentially allowing apples to spawn in the future — but only if they appear on land (which depends on the game state not shown here).

**Action: down**.
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (9,6). Dirt at (7,7).
  Thinking: You are at (9,6). Dirt is at (7,7).  

To clean dirt, you must be on the same cell as the dirt. You are not on (7,7), so you cannot clean it directly.  

You need to move to (7,7) to clean it.  

After cleaning, the river will become cleaner (less dirt), which may allow apples to spawn on land — but apples only spawn *on land* when the river is clean. However, cleaning dirt gives no points.  

Since apples only spawn *after* the river is clean, and you can only eat apples when you're on a cell with one, you must first clean the dirt to enable apple spawning.  

**Action: move left to (8,6), then move left again to (7,6), then move down to (7,7)**  

Once at (7,7), **clean** the dirt.  

After cleaning, the river is cleaner — possibly enabling apples to spawn on nearby land. But you can only eat apples when you're on a cell with one.  

So:  
✅ Move to (7,7)  
✅ Clean dirt (no points, but necessary)

  Obs: You at (5,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (5,0), nothing is visible. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first check if there's dirt to clean. Without any visible items, I cannot eat an apple.  

However, since I’m at (5,0) and nothing is visible, I should investigate the surroundings to find dirt or apples.  

Best action: **right** — to explore and potentially find dirt to clean or an apple.  

Reasoning: Without any visible items, I cannot eat or clean. Moving to explore is necessary to progress.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Dirt at (7,2).
  Thinking: You are at (7,2), and there is dirt at your position.  

Action: **clean**  
Reasoning: You can only clean dirt when you are on it. Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apples to spawn (since apples only appear when the river is clean). Even though cleaning doesn't give points directly, it's essential for enabling future apple spawns. Eating apples is the only way to gain points (+1.0 each), so cleaning first is a necessary step to make apples possible.  

→ Do **clean**.
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,6). Dirt at (7,7).
  Thinking: You are at (8,6). Dirt is at (7,7).  

To clean dirt, you must be on the same cell as the dirt. You are not on (7,7), so you cannot clean it directly.  

You can move to (7,7) to clean it. After cleaning, the river will be cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn on land — but note, cleaning dirt gives no points, and apples only spawn *when the river is clean*, not when you clean.  

Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (not directly from cleaning), and you gain no points from cleaning, your best move is:  

👉 **Move left to (7,6)**, then **move down to (7,7)** to clean the dirt.  

After cleaning, if apples appear on land, you can later eat them.  

**Action: left** (to get closer to (7,7))  

(Next step: after reaching (7,7), clean.)
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately.  

**Reasoning**:  
- To eat apples, there must be apples on the grid — which only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned).  
- You currently see nothing, so there's no immediate apple to eat.  
- Cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary to enable apple spawning.  

**Action**: *stay*  
→ This allows you to remain in position and monitor for changes (e.g., dirt or apples appearing later). If dirt is detected, you can clean it. If apples appear, you can eat them.  

**Next step**: Wait and observe. No action is beneficial yet.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,2), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apples to spawn, you must first clean dirt. However, without knowing if there's dirt at (7,2), you can't act.

But since you're at (7,2) and see nothing, it's likely the cell is clean or empty. In such cases, apples won't spawn unless dirt exists.

**Action: stay**  
**Reasoning:** Cleaning dirt is necessary to spawn apples. Without cleaning, no apples appear. Since eating apples gives points and cleaning gives no
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,6). Dirt at (6,5), (8,5).
  Thinking: At (7,6), you are not on any dirt, so you cannot clean. There are no apples visible at your position.  

Dirt is at (6,5) and (8,5) — both off-grid from your current position. To clean dirt, you must move to those cells.  

However, cleaning dirt gives no points, but it enables apples to spawn *on land* when the river is clean. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and currently there's dirt at (6,5) and (8,5), apples are not spawning yet.  

**Best action**: Move to one of the dirt cells (e.g., (6,5) or (8,5)) to clean it.  

**Reasoning**: Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning. Since eating apples gives +1 point each and cleaning dirt gives no points, you must clean to eventually gain apples.  

→ **Action: left** (to move to (6,6), then possibly down or left to (6,5)) — but better to go directly to (6,5) or (8,5).  

**Immediate action: left** (to (6,6)) —
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (9,0). Dirt at (8,1).
  Thinking: At (9,0), you are not on any dirt, and there's dirt at (8,1), which is adjacent to your position.  

To eat apples, the river must be clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt gives no points directly, we must first clean dirt to enable apple spawning.  

The only dirt is at (8,1). To clean it, you must move to (8,1) first.  

**Action: left** to move to (8,1).  
Then **clean** the dirt.  

After cleaning, if the river becomes clean, apples may spawn on land (but we don't know where yet). However, since we are not told apples are present, and we don't have a map of apple locations, we can only assume apple spawning happens after cleaning.  

But since we can only eat apples when we are on a cell with one, and we don’t have confirmation of apples spawning, we should prioritize cleaning.  

**Final action: left, then clean.**  

(Next step: after cleaning, if apples appear, we can eat them. But currently, only cleaning is possible.)

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,4). Dirt at (6,5), (8,5).
  Thinking: At (6,4), you are not on any dirt, so you can't clean yet. There's dirt at (6,5) and (8,5), both below you.  

To get apples, the river must be clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. But cleaning dirt gives no points — only apples give points.  

So:  
- You must move to (6,5) or (8,5) to clean dirt.  
- Cleaning dirt doesn't give points, but enables apple spawning on land (which is currently not active).  
- Once the river is clean, apples may spawn on land — but we don't have apple locations yet.  

Right now, no apples are visible. So first step: **move down to (6,5)** to clean dirt.  

**Action: down** → now at (6,5)  
Then **clean** → removes dirt at (6,5), no points.  

Now, if the river is clean, apples might spawn on land — but we need to know where land is. Since no land locations are given, and apples only spawn when river is clean, we assume land exists and apples may appear.  

But currently, we can only eat apples when we are on
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,6). Dirt at (6,5), (8,5).
  Thinking: At (6,6), I see dirt at (6,5) and (8,5). I am not on any dirt, so I cannot clean yet. Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. Since I can only clean dirt if I'm on the same cell, I must move to one of the dirt cells to clean them.

- (6,5) is directly below me — I can move down to (6,5) and clean it.
- (8,5) is to the right — I can move right to (8,5) and clean it.

Either move allows me to clean dirt, which will eventually allow apples to spawn on land (which is likely adjacent to clean river areas). Since I gain no points from cleaning, but gain +1.0 for each apple eaten, I should prioritize cleaning dirt to enable apple spawning.

Best next step: **move down to (6,5)** and clean it.

Reasoning: Cleaning dirt at (6,5) is adjacent and immediate. It will help clean the river and potentially allow apples to spawn nearby, which I can later eat. I cannot eat anything now, and cleaning is necessary to enable future apple spawns. 

**Action:
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Dirt at (8,1), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (8,0), you see dirt at (8,1) and (6,0).  

- You cannot eat an apple yet because there are no apples visible.  
- To spawn apples, the river must be clean — meaning dirt must be removed.  
- You can only clean dirt **if you are on the same cell** as the dirt.  

Currently:  
- You are at (8,0).  
- Dirt is at (8,1) — directly above you.  
- Dirt is at (6,0) — to the left.  

You **cannot clean (8,1)** because you are not on that cell.  
You **cannot clean (6,0)** because you are not on that cell.  

Thus, **you cannot clean any dirt right now**.  

No apples are spawning because the river is not clean.  

✅ Best action: **move up** to (8,1) to clean the dirt there.  

After cleaning (8,1), the river will be cleaner, possibly enabling apple spawning.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,3). Dirt at (7,4), (7,2).
  Thinking: At (6,3), you are not on any dirt, so you can't clean yet. There's dirt at (7,4) and (7,2), which are not adjacent to you. To clean dirt, you must move to a cell with dirt and then use "clean".  

Currently, no apples are spawning because there's dirt on the map — clean dirt is required to enable apple spawning.  

**Action:** Move to (7,3) to get closer to the dirt at (7,4) and (7,2).  

Best next step: **right** to (7,3), then clean if possible.  

→ Reason: You need to reach dirt to clean it. Once dirt is cleaned, the river becomes cleaner, enabling apple spawning. Then you can eat apples.  

**Next action: right**.
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,5). Dirt at (6,5), (8,5), (7,4).
  Thinking: At (6,5), there is dirt on your cell.  

Actions available:  
- **Clean**: You can clean dirt at your current position (6,5).  
- **Eat**: No apple at (6,5) currently — only apples spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned).  

**Reasoning**:  
Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), and there's dirt at (6,5), we must first **clean** the dirt at (6,5) to potentially enable apple spawning.  

**Best action: clean**  

After cleaning (6,5), the dirt is removed, and if conditions allow, apples may spawn. But currently, no apples are present.  

→ **Action: clean** ✅
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (7,2), (8,1), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (8,1), you are on a cell that has dirt. You can **clean** this dirt, which is necessary to potentially enable apple spawning.  

Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning, dirt must be cleaned. Currently, dirt is at (7,2), (8,1), and (6,0). You are at (8,1), so you can clean that dirt immediately.  

**Action: clean**  
→ This removes dirt from (8,1), making the cell clean.  
→ This may help enable apple spawning in the future, especially if nearby land becomes accessible.  

No apples are currently present, and you cannot eat anything yet.  

**Next step:** After cleaning, check if any apples appear (though spawning depends on overall river cleanliness, which isn't fully specified). But since apples only spawn *when the river is clean*, and we only have partial info, the priority is to clean dirt to enable future apple spawning.  

Reasoning: Without any visible dirt or apples, and since you can't eat or clean without knowing the state of the cell, staying is safe. You may need to explore adjacent cells to find dirt to clean and eventually apples. Moving without information could waste steps. Stay to assess the situation further.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,6). Dirt at (7,7).
  Thinking: At (7,6), there is no apple visible. Dirt is at (7,7), which is directly below you. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and you can only clean dirt when you're on the same cell, you must first **move to (7,7)** to clean it.

Action: **down**  
Reason: Moving down to (7,7) allows you to clean the dirt, which may enable apples to spawn on nearby land (e.g., (7,6) or adjacent cells). Cleaning dirt is necessary but doesn't give points directly — it's a prerequisite for apples. After cleaning, you can then assess whether apples appear and whether to eat them.  

Next step: clean → then check for apples.  

**Action: down**
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first check if there's dirt to clean. Without visibility, you can't assume dirt is present.

**Action: stay**  
Reasoning: Staying in place is safe and allows you to assess the situation. If you move without knowing whether dirt is present, you might miss an opportunity or waste steps. You need to confirm if dirt exists before cleaning. If dirt is present, cleaning will enable apples to spawn. Without that, you can’t eat apples.  

Next step: observe or move to a neighboring cell to check for dirt or apples. But currently, with no view, **stay** is the most logical first action.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Dirt at (8,2).
  Thinking: At (7,2), you are adjacent to dirt at (8,2). Since you can only clean dirt when you are on the same cell, you cannot clean the dirt at (8,2) from (7,2). 

To clean dirt, you must move to the cell with dirt. So, move **right** to (8,2) to clean it. Cleaning dirt doesn't give points, but it's necessary to enable apple spawning on land. Once the river is clean (i.e., no dirt), apples may spawn on land cells.

Action: **right** (to move to (8,2) and clean the dirt).
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Dirt at (8,5).
  Thinking: You are at (7,5). There is dirt at (8,5), which is to your right.  

Since you can only clean dirt or eat apples **at your current position**, you cannot clean the dirt at (8,5) unless you move there first.  

Right now, there's no apple at (7,5), so you can't eat one.  

**Action: Move right to (8,5)** to clean the dirt.  

→ After cleaning, the dirt is removed, and the river becomes cleaner (which may enable apple spawning in the future).  

**Next step:** After cleaning, check if apples have spawned (though not visible here). If apples appear, you can eat them.  

**Reasoning:** Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apples to spawn. Without cleaning, no apples can appear. So, move to (8,5) and clean.  

**Action: right** → then **clean**.
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apples to spawn, the river must be clean—meaning dirt must be cleaned. However, cleaning dirt gives no points, so it's a necessary step before apples can appear.

Action: **clean**  
Reason: You are at (6,0), and there's no visible apple. To eventually eat apples, the river must be clean. Since you can only clean dirt at your current position, and no dirt is visible, you must first check if there's dirt here. If not, you need to explore. But since nothing is visible, the safest assumption is that you are on land or water—no dirt. Thus, you might not be able to clean anything.

Wait: The rules say apples only spawn when the river is clean. If you're on land, and there's dirt, you can clean it. But if you see nothing, it may mean no dirt is present.

Since you see nothing, and no dirt is visible, you may already be on clean land. Then apples might not spawn yet.

But the rules don’t say apples spawn automatically—only that they spawn when the river is clean. So if

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,2). Dirt at (8,2).
  Thinking: You are at (8,2), and there is dirt at your position.  

Action: **clean**  
Reason: You can only gain apples when there is clean land, and apples don't spawn on dirt. Since you're on dirt, you must clean it first to make land available for apples. Cleaning gives no points directly, but it's necessary to enable future apple spawning.  

→ Do **clean**.
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,5). Dirt at (8,5).
  Thinking: You are at (8,5), and there is dirt at your position.  

Action: **clean**  
Reason: You can only eat apples when there is clean land, and apples only spawn on clean land. Since there is dirt at (8,5), you must clean it first to enable apple spawning. Cleaning dirt gives no points directly, but it's necessary to allow apples to appear. After cleaning, you can potentially eat an apple if one spawns.  

→ Do **clean**.
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first determine whether there's dirt to clean.  

But since nothing is visible, and you're at (6,0), it's possible you're on land with no immediate dirt or apples. Without any visible dirt or apples, cleaning or eating isn't possible.  

Best action: **stay** — to remain in position and assess the environment further.  

**Reasoning**: You cannot clean or eat without visible dirt or apples. Since nothing is visible, moving might lead to wasted steps. Staying allows you to monitor changes or wait for new information.

--- Step 29 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,2), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apple spawning, you must first clean dirt. However, since nothing is visible, you don’t know if there’s dirt or apples nearby.

**Best action: stay**  
Reason: Without visibility, moving could lead to wasted effort. Staying allows you to assess the situation. If dirt is present, you’ll be able to clean it. If not, apples may already be available. Waiting is safer than guessing.  

→ **Action: stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,5). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,5), nothing is visible. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first check if there's dirt to clean. Without any visible items, I cannot eat an apple.  

Action: **clean**  
Reason: To enable apple spawning, the river must be clean. Since I'm at (8,5) and nothing is visible, it's possible I'm on a dirt cell. Cleaning it is necessary to potentially allow apples to spawn later. I must act now to progress.  

Next step: After cleaning, I'll reassess the environment.
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,0), nothing is visible. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when there's less dirt), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first determine if there's dirt to clean.  

With no visible items, I cannot confirm if there's dirt at (6,0). Without dirt, I cannot clean it, and without cleaning, apples won't spawn.  

**Action: stay**  
Reason: I need to assess the environment first. Since nothing is visible, staying allows me to remain in position and possibly detect changes or interactions later. Moving without information could lead to wasted steps.  

→ **Stay**

--- Step 30 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,2), nothing is visible. Since there are no apples or dirt in sight, I cannot eat or clean immediately. To progress, I need to explore the area to find dirt (to clean) or apples (to eat). 

Action: **right**  
Reason: Moving right may reveal dirt or apples. Without any information, exploration is necessary to find usable resources. Cleaning dirt enables apple spawning, and apples give points. Exploration is the first step.
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,5). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,5), nothing is visible. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first check if there's dirt to clean. Without any visible items, I cannot eat an apple.  

Action: **stay**  
Reason: No visible items to eat or clean. Staying allows me to assess the environment further. If dirt appears later, I can act accordingly.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first determine if there's dirt to clean. Without any visible items, it's likely the cell is clean or empty.

However, to enable apples to spawn, dirt must be cleaned. Since you can't see anything, you should **investigate** the surroundings to find dirt.

**Action: left** (to check (5,0))  
→ Reason: Moving left allows you to explore adjacent cells to detect dirt or apples. Without visibility, you can't eat or clean safely. Exploration is necessary to find dirt to clean and eventually apples.  

**Next step:** Once dirt is found, clean it. Then, if apples appear (when the river is clean), you can eat them.  

→ Final goal: Clean dirt → enable apples → eat apples for points.  

**Immediate action: left** ✅

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (9,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (9,2), nothing is visible. Since there are no apples or dirt detected, I cannot eat or clean. To progress, I need to explore the area to find dirt (to clean) or apples (to eat).  

**Action: left**  
Reason: Moving left from (9,2) might reveal dirt or apples in the adjacent cell. Exploration is necessary to enable apple spawning (which requires clean river areas). Cleaning dirt enables apple spawning, but cleaning gives no points—only apples do. So, exploration is essential.  

→ **Move left**
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,5). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,5), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apples to spawn, you must first clean dirt — but you can only clean dirt if it's on your current cell.

Since nothing is visible, it's possible your cell (8,5) has no dirt or apple. Without confirmation, you can't act. However, to progress, you should first **check your surroundings** to see if there's dirt or apples.

Best action: **stay** — to maintain position and assess the situation. If dirt is present, you can clean it; if not, you may need to explore further.

→ **Action: stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (5,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately.  

To progress, you must first determine whether there's dirt to clean or apples to eat. Since nothing is visible, it's likely that either:  
- There's no dirt (so no cleaning possible), or  
- The area is clean, so apples may not be spawning yet.  

Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned). Since you're at (5,0) and see nothing, it's possible you're on clean land or on a cell with no dirt.  

**Action: stay**  
Reasoning: Without any visible items, moving would risk missing a potential apple or dirt. Staying allows you to assess the situation. If dirt appears later, you can act. If apples appear, you can eat them.  

→ **Stay**

--- Step 32 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,2), nothing is visible, so I don't know if there's dirt or an apple. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points, I must first check if there's dirt to clean.  

But with no view, I can't see the surroundings. Therefore, I cannot determine whether to clean or eat.  

**Action: stay**  
Reason: No visible information to act on—cannot safely clean or eat without knowing the environment. Waiting is the safest initial step.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,5). Dirt at (7,5).
  Thinking: At (8,5), you are adjacent to dirt at (7,5). Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when there's no dirt), and you can only clean dirt at your current position, you must first **clean** the dirt at (7,5) to make it clean.

However, you are **not** on the dirt cell (7,5); you're at (8,5), which is adjacent. Therefore, you **cannot clean** (7,5) directly unless you move there first.

So, to clean the dirt, you must **move to (7,5)**.

**Action: move left to (7,5)**  
Then, **clean** the dirt.  

After cleaning, the area becomes clean, which may allow apples to spawn on land. But since apples only spawn *on land* when the river is clean, and you are now on clean land, you could potentially eat an apple *if one is present*.

But currently, there's no mention of an apple at (7,5). So, after cleaning, if no apple is present, you may need to explore further.

**Best next step: move left to (7,5), then clean
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (5,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first determine whether there's dirt to clean. Without any visible items, it's likely the cell is either clean or empty.

However, since apples spawn only when the river is clean, and you're at (5,0), you need to assess if there's dirt in your current cell or nearby.

But the prompt says "Nothing in your view," so no dirt or apples are visible. Therefore, you cannot eat or clean anything at this moment.

**Best action: stay**  
Reason: You have no visible dirt to clean, and no apples to eat. Moving would risk missing a potential opportunity or moving into an area with no value. Staying is safe and allows you to reassess if anything appears later.

--- Step 9 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,3). Dirt at (7,4), (7,2).
  Thinking: At (7,3), you are on a clean cell (no dirt). Dirt is at (7,4) and (7,2), both adjacent vertically.  

You cannot eat an apple yet because apples only spawn when the river is clean — which depends on cleaning dirt. Since dirt is present, apples aren't spawning.  

You must clean the dirt at (7,4) or (7,2) to make the river clean and enable apple spawning.  

Best action: **clean** at (7,4) or (7,2).  

Let’s pick **clean (7,4)** — it’s directly above you.  

After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner, potentially enabling apple spawning. Then, you can move to a position with apples.  

**Action: clean** (at (7,4))  

Reasoning: Cleaning dirt is necessary to spawn apples. Without cleaning, no apples can be eaten. You must act first to enable future apple consumption.
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,5). Dirt at (8,5), (7,4).
  Thinking: At (6,5), I see dirt at (8,5) and (7,4). I am not on any dirt, so I cannot clean yet. Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be removed. Since I'm at (6,5), I can move to (8,5) or (7,4) to clean dirt, but only if I'm on those cells.

- To clean (8,5): move right to (8,5).  
- To clean (7,4): move down-left to (7,4).

I should prioritize cleaning dirt to enable apple spawning. Since I can only clean when on a dirt cell, I need to move there first.

Best action: **move right to (8,5)** to clean dirt.  

After cleaning (8,5), the river becomes cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn. Then I can assess whether to move to (7,4) or stay to eat if an apple appears.  

**Action: right**.
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (7,2), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (8,1), you are not on any dirt, so you can't clean. There's no apple visible at your current position.  

Dirt is at (7,2) and (6,0) — both are not adjacent to you. To eat apples, the river must be clean (i.e., dirt must be cleaned), and apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Since you're not on dirt, you can't clean it yet.  

**Action: Move toward dirt to clean it.**  
Best next step: Move left to (7,1), then up to (7,2) to clean the dirt at (7,2).  

After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner, enabling apple spawning on land. Then you can return to (8,1) or move to areas where apples may spawn.  

**Reasoning:** Cleaning dirt is necessary to spawn apples. You must first clean dirt at (7,2) or (6,0) to enable apple growth. Since (7,2) is adjacent, it's the closest.  

**Next action: left → up (to (7,2))**  
Then clean.  

→ After cleaning, check for apples. If any spawn,

--- Step 10 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,3). Dirt at (7,4), (7,2).
  Thinking: At (7,3), there is no apple currently. Dirt is at (7,4) and (7,2), both adjacent to your position.

- You cannot eat an apple because none are present.
- You can clean dirt only if you are on the same cell as the dirt. Since you are at (7,3), you are not on (7,4) or (7,2), so you cannot clean those dirt cells directly.

Thus, **you cannot clean any dirt or eat an apple at this moment**.

Best action: **stay** — to monitor the situation. Later, if you move to a dirt cell (e.g., (7,4) or (7,2)), you can clean it, which may eventually allow apples to spawn on land (since clean river = more apples).

→ **Action: stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Dirt at (8,5), (7,4).
  Thinking: At (7,5), you can see dirt at (8,5) and (7,4).  

- You cannot eat an apple yet because there are no apples mentioned — apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed).  
- To enable apple spawning, you must clean dirt.  
- You can only clean dirt if you are on the same cell as the dirt.  

Currently, you are at (7,5), which is adjacent to dirt at (8,5) and (7,4), but not on them. So you **cannot clean** those dirt cells directly.  

**Action:** Move to a dirt cell to clean it.  

Best move: **right** to (8,5) — you can clean that dirt.  

After cleaning (8,5), you can then consider moving to (7,4) to clean it.  

**Next step:** Clean dirt → enables river to be clean → apples may spawn → then eat them.  

**Immediate action: right** (to (8,5)) → clean.  

✅ Reasoning: Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning. You must first clean dirt cells to create conditions for apples. You cannot eat apples unless the river
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Dirt at (7,2), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (7,1), you are not on any dirt, so you can't clean. There's dirt at (7,2) and (6,0), but you can only clean dirt if you are on the same cell.  

Currently, no apples are spawning because there's dirt on the map (river is not clean). To enable apple spawning, you must clean dirt — but only where you are.  

So:  
- You cannot clean (7,2) or (6,0) from (7,1).  
- You can only clean if you move to a cell with dirt.  

**Best action: move to (7,2)** to clean the dirt there.  

After cleaning (7,2), the river becomes cleaner (less dirt), which may allow apples to spawn. Then, if apples appear, you can eat them.  

**Action: right** (to move to (7,2))  

Reasoning: Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning, and eating apples gives points. Since cleaning gives no points directly, it's a prerequisite. Moving to (7,2) allows cleaning and progress toward apple spawning.

--- Step 11 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,3). Dirt at (7,4), (7,2).
  Thinking: At (7,3), you are on a cell with no dirt, so you can't clean anything here. There's dirt at (7,4) and (7,2), but you can only clean dirt if you're on the same cell.  

Since you're not on those dirt cells, you cannot clean them directly. Therefore, you cannot spawn apples (apples only spawn when the river is clean, which requires cleaning dirt).  

**Action: stay**  
Reason: You can't clean dirt from (7,4) or (7,2) from (7,3), and eating an apple requires being on a cell with one. No apple is present at (7,3) or nearby (since dirt is blocking apple spawning). Staying is safe and avoids moving into a position with no benefit.  

**Final action: stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,5). Dirt at (8,5), (7,4).
  Thinking: At (8,5), there is dirt on your cell. You can **clean** it to make space for apples to spawn. Apples only appear on land when the river is clean, so cleaning dirt is necessary but doesn't give points directly.  

Available actions:  
- **clean**: Yes — you can clean (8,5) to remove dirt.  
- **eat**: No — no apple at (8,5) currently.  
- Move? Not necessary yet — you're at a dirt cell, and cleaning is needed first.  

**Action: clean**  
Reasoning: Cleaning dirt at (8,5) will improve the river's cleanliness, potentially enabling apple spawning in the future. Since apples only spawn on clean land, this is a necessary step before eating.  

After cleaning, check if apples appear (though not visible in current state). Next, you may want to explore adjacent cells for apples.  

**Next step: clean (8,5)**.
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (7,2), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (8,1), you are not on any dirt, so you can't clean it yet. There's dirt at (7,2) and (6,0), both of which are not adjacent to you. Therefore, you cannot clean them directly.

Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — but since you can't clean dirt at (7,2) or (6,0) from your current position, no apples are currently spawning.

Available actions:
- Move to a neighboring cell (up, down, left, right) to get closer to dirt.
- Stay — no benefit.

Best move: **left** to (7,1), which is adjacent to (7,2) — now you can potentially clean dirt at (7,2) if you move there.

**Reasoning**: You must clean dirt to enable apple spawning. Since you're currently isolated from dirt, movement is necessary. Moving left to (7,1) puts you adjacent to (7,2), allowing future cleaning. After cleaning, the river will be cleaner, enabling apples to spawn on land, which you can then eat.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,5). Dirt at (7,6), (7,4).
  Thinking: At (5,5), I am not on any dirt, so I can't clean yet. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — currently, dirt is at (7,6) and (7,4), so the river is not clean. To enable apple spawning, I need to clean the dirt.

I must move to one of the dirt cells to clean them. The closest dirt is at (7,6) and (7,4). Moving to (7,6) requires going down to (6,6), then down to (7,6). Similarly, (7,4) requires going down to (6,4), then down to (7,4).

But I can only clean dirt if I'm on the cell. So first, I need to move to (7,6) or (7,4).

Let’s choose (7,6) — it's to the right and down.

**Action: down** → (6,5)  
**Action: down** → (7,5)  
**Action: right** → (7,6)  

Now I'm on (7,6), dirt cell.  
**Action: clean** → dirt removed.  

Now the river is
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (9,7). Dirt at (7,8), (7,6).
  Thinking: At (9,7), you are not on any dirt, so you cannot clean. There are no apples visible at your position.  

Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned). Currently, dirt is at (7,8) and (7,6), which are not adjacent to you.  

To maximize points:  
- You must clean dirt to enable apple spawning.  
- But you can only clean dirt when you are on the same cell as dirt.  

You are at (9,7). The dirt is at (7,8) and (7,6). You need to move to one of those cells to clean.  

Best action: **Move left to (8,7)**, then to (7,7), then to (7,6) or (7,8) to clean.  

But first, **you cannot eat** because no apple is present.  

**Immediate best action: move left to (8,7)** to get closer to (7,6) or (7,8).  

→ **Action: left**  

(Reason: Cleaning dirt is necessary to spawn apples, and you must be on a dirt cell to clean it. Moving toward dirt is

  Thinking: At (9,0), you are adjacent to dirt at (8,0) and (8,1). You cannot eat an apple yet because there are no apples visible, and apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned).

Since you are at (9,0), you can move to (8,0) to clean the dirt there. Cleaning dirt gives no points, but it's necessary to make land clean and allow apples to spawn later.

**Action: clean** (at (8,0))  
→ This removes dirt from (8,0), contributing to a cleaner river.  

After cleaning, you may want to assess if other dirt can be cleaned or if apples have now spawned. But currently, only one dirt cell is accessible directly.

**Next step:** After cleaning (8,0), consider whether to move to (8,1) to clean it too, or stay and wait.

But since apples spawn only when the river is clean (i.e., no dirt), and we need to clean dirt to enable that, **cleaning is necessary**.

**Final action: clean** (at (8,0))  

→ Reason: Cleaning dirt is required to enable apple spawning. Eating apples

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,5). Dirt at (7,6), (8,5), (7,4).
  Thinking: At (6,5), I see dirt at (7,6), (8,5), and (7,4). I am not on any of those dirt cells, so I cannot clean them directly. To eat apples, the river must be clean — meaning there must be no dirt. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and I can only clean dirt when I'm on a cell with dirt, I must first move to a dirt cell to clean it.

The closest dirt cells to me are:
- (8,5): directly to the right (right action)
- (7,6): diagonally down-right — not adjacent
- (7,4): diagonally down-left — not adjacent

So, I should move **right** to (8,5), then clean it. After that, I can evaluate whether other dirt cells are accessible.

**Action: right** → move to (8,5)  
Then **clean** → removes dirt at (8,5)

Now, dirt remains at (7,6) and (7,4), but I am at (8,5). From here, I can move to (7,5) to reach (7,6) or (7,4
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,7). Dirt at (6,8), (7,8), (7,6).
  Thinking: At (8,7), you are not on any dirt cells. Dirt is at (6,8), (7,8), (7,6) — all of which are outside your current position.  

To eat apples, the river must be clean (i.e., dirt must be removed). Since you can only clean dirt **on your current cell**, and you are not on any dirt cells, you **cannot clean any dirt right now**.  

Therefore:  
- You **cannot eat an apple** (no apple is spawning because the river isn't clean).  
- You **cannot clean dirt** unless you move to a dirt cell.  

**Best action: Move to a dirt cell to clean it.**  

Best next move: **left** to (7,7) — not directly on dirt, but closer. Then from there, move to (7,8) or (7,6) to clean.  

But currently, you are at (8,7).  

Available dirt: (6,8), (7,8), (7,6).  

Closest dirt: (7,8) — one step left to (7,7), then up to (7,8).  

**Action: left** to
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (9,0). Dirt at (8,1), (8,0).
  Thinking: At (9,0), you are on land. There is dirt at (8,1) and (8,0), but you can only clean dirt if you are on the same cell. You are not on (8,0) or (8,1), so you cannot clean those dirt cells directly.

There is no apple mentioned at your current position (9,0), so you cannot eat an apple yet.

**Action: stay**  
Reasoning: You cannot clean dirt or eat an apple from your current position. Staying is safe and allows you to assess if you can move to a cell with dirt to clean or if apples appear later when the river is clean. Apple spawning depends on clean land, so cleaning dirt (even if not directly beneficial) is key to enabling apples. Since you can't clean dirt now, you should stay and possibly move strategically later.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,2), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first check if there's dirt to clean. Without visibility, you cannot determine if dirt is present.

**Action: stay**  
Reasoning: Staying allows you to assess the situation. If dirt is present, you can clean it later. If there's nothing, you may need to explore. Since nothing is visible, moving blindly could waste actions. Best to stay and possibly detect dirt or apples in the next observation.  

→ **Stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Dirt at (7,5).
  Thinking: You are at (7,5), and there is dirt at your position.  

Action: **clean**  
Reason: You can only eat apples when the river is clean, which requires removing dirt. Since you're on dirt, you must clean it first. Cleaning dirt gives no points directly, but it's necessary to enable apple spawning. After cleaning, if apples appear, you can eat them for +1.0 points.  

→ Do **clean**.
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,0). Dirt at (7,0).
  Thinking: At (5,0), you are not on dirt. Dirt is at (7,0), which is to the right.  

To clean dirt, you must be on the same cell as the dirt. So, you need to move to (7,0) to clean it.  

Cleaning dirt gives no points, but it enables apples to spawn on land (which is now cleaner). After cleaning, if apples spawn, you can eat them for +1.0 each.  

**Action: right** (to move to (7,0))  
Then: clean (to remove dirt and improve river cleanliness)  
After that, if apples spawn on land (e.g., nearby cells), you can eat them.  

**Reasoning**: Clean dirt first to enable apple spawning. You can't eat apples unless the river is clean and apples are on land.  

→ **Next action: right**

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,2). Dirt at (7,2).
  Thinking: At (8,2), there is dirt at (7,2), which is to the left. Since you can only clean dirt if you are on the same cell, you cannot clean (7,2) from (8,2). There's no apple mentioned at your current position, so you cannot eat one either.

Action: **left** to move to (7,2) to clean the dirt.  
Reasoning: Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apples to spawn, and apples only appear when the river is clean. By cleaning the dirt at (7,2), you improve the environment for future apple spawning.  

Next step: After cleaning, check if apples appear (though not explicitly stated, the game logic implies clean areas allow apple spawning). Then, if apples are present, you can eat them.  

**Action: left**.
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Dirt at (7,6).
  Thinking: You are at (7,5). Dirt is at (7,6), which is directly above you.  

Action: **up**  
→ Move to (7,6) to clean the dirt.  

After cleaning, the dirt is removed, and the river becomes cleaner (which may allow apples to spawn). However, cleaning itself gives 0 points.  

Once clean, you can then consider moving to a spot where apples might spawn (e.g., land cells adjacent to clean river areas).  

But currently, the only action possible is to clean the dirt at (7,6).  

**Reasoning**: Cleaning is necessary to enable apple spawning. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and you're currently on land at (7,5), you must clean the adjacent dirt at (7,6) to improve conditions.  

✅ Action: **up** (to reach (7,6))  
Then **clean** (to remove dirt).  

After that, assess if apples are now available in nearby land cells.  

**Next step**: After cleaning, check for apples or plan movement to eat one.  

But for now: **up** → **clean**.
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Dirt at (7,0).
  Thinking: You are at (6,0). Dirt is at (7,0), which is to your right.  

You cannot clean dirt unless you are on the same cell as the dirt.  
Since you are at (6,0) and dirt is at (7,0), you must move to (7,0) to clean it.  

**Action: right**  
→ Move to (7,0) to clean the dirt.  

After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner (dirt removed), which may enable apples to spawn (though apples only spawn when the river is clean, and they appear on land — but no apples are mentioned currently).  

Now, you are on a clean cell. However, there's no apple at (7,0) mentioned.  

**Next step**: After cleaning, check if apples have appeared. Since no apple is noted, you can only eat if one spawns. Without an apple, you cannot eat.  

**Best action now**: stay (to monitor for apple spawn), or move to check nearby land cells for apples.  

But since apples only spawn *when the river is clean*, and we just cleaned, apples *may* now appear on land. However, no specific apple location is given.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Dirt at (7,2).
  Thinking: You are at (7,2), and there is dirt at your position.  

Action: **clean**  
Reason: You can only clean dirt when you are on it. Cleaning the dirt at (7,2) will make the cell clean, which may allow apples to spawn later. Since apples only spawn on clean land, cleaning is necessary to enable apple spawning. Eating apples gives points, but you can't eat them yet—there are no apples present.  

**Next step**: After cleaning, check if apples appear. If so, you can then eat them.  

→ Choose: **clean**
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Dirt at (7,6).
  Thinking: At (7,5), there is no apple visible. Dirt is at (7,6), which is directly above you. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and you can only clean dirt when you're on the same cell, you cannot clean the dirt at (7,6) from (7,5).

Thus, the best action is: **up** to move to (7,6), where you can then **clean** the dirt. Cleaning the dirt will improve the river's cleanliness, which may enable apples to spawn on adjacent land cells later. After cleaning, you can explore further to find apples.

**Action: up**
  Decision: 'up' -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Dirt at (7,0).
  Thinking: You are at (7,0), and there is dirt at your position.  

Action: **clean**  
Reason: You can only gain apples when the river is clean, and apples only spawn on land when there's no dirt. Since you're currently on dirt, you must clean it first to enable apple spawning. Cleaning dirt gives no points directly, but it's necessary to unlock the ability to eat apples later.  

After cleaning, you can then consider moving or eating if apples appear.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,2), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), you must first check if there's dirt to clean. Without sight of any items, you cannot eat an apple.  

Action: **clean** (if dirt is present), or **stay** (if uncertain).  

But since nothing is visible, and you can't eat without an apple, and cleaning is necessary to enable apples, you must assume there might be dirt.  

Best action: **clean** — to enable future apple spawning.  

**Reasoning**: Without cleaning, apples won't spawn. You can't eat anything currently, so cleaning is necessary to progress.

--- Step 12 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,3). Dirt at (7,4), (7,2).
  Thinking: At (7,3), you are on a clean cell (no dirt). Dirt is at (7,4) and (7,2), both adjacent vertically.  

To spawn apples, the river must be clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and dirt is present at (7,4) and (7,2), you must clean those cells to enable apple spawning.  

But you can only clean dirt *on your current cell*. So you must move to a cell with dirt to clean it.  

Current dirt positions:  
- (7,4) → directly above (7,3)  
- (7,2) → directly below (7,3)  

So you can move **up to (7,4)** or **down to (7,2)** to clean dirt.  

**Best action:** Move up to (7,4) to clean dirt. After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn on adjacent land cells. Then you can potentially eat apples.  

**Action: up**  
→ Move to (7,4), clean dirt.  

This is necessary to progress toward apple spawning. Eating is not possible yet.  

**Final
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,5). Dirt at (7,4).
  Thinking: At (8,5), you are not on dirt, so you can't clean it directly. Dirt is at (7,4), which is not adjacent to your current position. To clean dirt, you must move to that cell first.  

However, cleaning dirt gives no points, but it enables apples to spawn on land when the river is clean. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and you're currently not on dirt, you can't eat an apple yet.

**Action: move left to (7,5)** (adjacent to dirt at (7,4))  
Then you can move down or left to reach (7,4) and clean it.

**Reasoning:** You need to clean dirt to enable apple spawning. Without cleaning dirt, no apples can appear. So, prioritize movement to clean the dirt at (7,4).  

→ **Next action: left** (to (7,5))
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Dirt at (7,2), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (7,1), you can see dirt at (7,2) and (6,0).  

- You cannot eat an apple right now because there's no apple visible (apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and currently, dirt exists).  
- You can **clean** dirt only if you are on the same cell as the dirt.  
  - You are at (7,1), so you can **clean** the dirt at (7,2) only if you move there first.  
  - You are not on (6,0), so you can't clean that dirt directly.  

**Best action: move to (7,2)** to clean the dirt there.  

After cleaning (7,2), the river becomes cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn on land (e.g., at (7,1) or nearby), enabling future apple eating.  

**Action: right** (to move to (7,2))  

→ Reason: Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning. Without cleaning, no apples can appear.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,3). Dirt at (7,4), (7,2).
  Thinking: At (7,3), you are on land. Dirt is at (7,4) and (7,2), both adjacent to you.  

- You **cannot eat** an apple yet because there are no apples mentioned — apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned).  
- You **can clean** dirt if you are on the same cell as it. But you are at (7,3), and dirt is at (7,4) and (7,2), which are not on your cell.  
- Therefore, you **cannot clean** dirt directly from here.  
- You must **move** to a cell with dirt to clean it.  

Best action: **move down** or **move up** to get closer to dirt? Wait — (7,2) and (7,4) are both directly above and below (7,3).  

- (7,4) is directly above → move up to (7,4) to clean it.  
- (7,2) is directly below → move down to (7,2) to clean it.  

Either move will allow you to clean dirt. Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning.  

**Action: up
  Decision: 'up' -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Dirt at (7,4).
  Thinking: At (7,5), there is no apple visible, but there is dirt at (7,4), directly below you. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when there's no dirt), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must clean the dirt at (7,4) to potentially enable apple spawning.

However, I can only clean dirt if I'm on the same cell as the dirt. Since I am at (7,5) and the dirt is at (7,4), I need to move down to (7,4) first.

**Action: down**  
→ Move to (7,4), now on the dirt.  
**Action: clean**  
→ Remove the dirt. This makes the area clean, potentially enabling apple spawning.  

After cleaning, the river at (7,4) is now clean. Apples may spawn on land cells adjacent to clean areas, but since no apples are mentioned, and I'm not on a land cell with an apple, I cannot eat one yet.

**Next step**: Check if any apples have spawned (but not specified). Since no apple is present and I have no information about spawning, I should stay cautious.

**Final action:
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (7,2), (6,0).

Dirt is at (7,2) and (6,0) — both are not adjacent to you, so you can't clean them directly.  

Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and you can't clean dirt from your current position, no apples are available.  

**Action: stay**  
Reason: You can't clean dirt or eat apples from here. Staying is safe and avoids unnecessary movement. You must get closer to dirt to clean it, which will eventually allow apples to spawn.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,3). Dirt at (7,4), (7,2).
  Thinking: At (7,3), there is no apple currently. Dirt is at (7,4) and (7,2), both of which are adjacent to your position.  

Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first clean the dirt to enable apple spawning.  

However, I can only clean dirt if I'm on the same cell as the dirt. I am at (7,3), which is not directly on (7,4) or (7,2).  

So I need to move to one of those dirt cells to clean them.  

Best action: **move down to (8,3)**? No — that doesn't help.  

Wait — I need to go to (7,4) or (7,2) to clean.  

From (7,3):  
- Move **up** to (6,3)? No dirt there.  
- Move **down** to (8,3)? Unknown.  
- Move **left** to (7,2) → **this is a dirt cell**.  
- Move **right** to (7,4) → **this is a dirt cell**.

Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Dirt at (7,4).
  Thinking: At (7,5), there is no apple visible. Dirt is at (7,4), which is directly below you. Since you can only clean dirt if you are on the same cell, you must move to (7,4) to clean it.

**Action: down**  
→ Move to (7,4) to clean the dirt.  
(Cleaning dirt does not give points, but it enables apple spawning in the future when the river is clean.)

After cleaning, the river will be cleaner, potentially allowing apples to spawn. Then, you can return to (7,5) or move elsewhere to eat apples.

**Next step: clean** (after moving down)  
→ Clean dirt at (7,4).

Then, after the river is clean, check if apples appear — if so, you can eat them.

**Final reasoning:** Clean the dirt first to enable apple spawning. You cannot eat an apple without it spawning, so cleaning is a prerequisite.
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Dirt at (7,6), (8,5), (7,4).
  Thinking: At (7,5), I see dirt at (7,6), (8,5), and (7,4). I cannot eat an apple because there is no apple visible — apples only spawn when the river is clean, which depends on removing dirt. Since I'm not on any dirt cell, I can't clean it directly.

To enable apple spawning, I must first clean the dirt cells. But I can only clean dirt when I'm on the same cell as the dirt.

So, I need to move to a dirt cell to clean it.

Best move: **down** to (8,5) — that's a dirt cell I can clean.

After cleaning (8,5), the river gets cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn (though spawning isn't directly visible here). Then I can move to other dirt cells if needed.

But currently, I can only act on what I'm on.

**Action: down** → move to (8,5) to clean dirt.  

(Reasoning: Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning. I must first clean dirt to potentially gain apples later. I can't eat anything now, so movement to clean is essential.)  

✅ Action: **down**
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,7). Dirt at (6,8), (7,8), (7,6).
  Thinking: At (7,7), I see dirt at (6,8), (7,8), and (7,6). I am not on any dirt, so I cannot clean yet. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning I need to clean dirt to make land appear and allow apples to spawn.

Since I can only clean dirt when I'm on a cell with dirt, and I'm currently at (7,7), I must move to one of the dirt cells to clean them.

The closest dirt cells are:
- (7,6) — directly below
- (7,8) — directly above
- (6,8) — diagonally up-left

Moving to (7,6) or (7,8) is optimal — both are adjacent.

Let’s choose **down** to (7,6), since it's directly accessible and allows me to clean that dirt.

**Action: down**  
Now at (7,6), I can **clean**.

After cleaning (7,6), that cell becomes clean land. Now, the river is slightly cleaner — more land available — and possibly apples may spawn (though not yet visible).

But since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and we

Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (9,0). Dirt at (8,1), (8,0).
  Thinking: At (9,0), you are adjacent to dirt at (8,0) and (8,1). You cannot clean dirt unless you are on the same cell. Since you are at (9,0), you are not on (8,0) or (8,1), so you cannot clean dirt directly.

There are no apples mentioned, and apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — which requires cleaning dirt. Since no apples are present and you can't clean dirt from your current position, you cannot eat any apples.

Best action: **stay** — to remain in position and assess if you can move to a dirt cell to clean it later.

But wait — can you move to (8,0)? Yes, if you move left to (8,0), you can then clean it. Cleaning dirt at (8,0) will help clean the river, potentially enabling apple spawning later.

So, better plan: **move left to (8,0)** → then **clean** → then possibly move to other cells to clean or eat apples.

But the question is: what should you do *now*?

Given the current situation and goal (maximize points via eating apples), you must first clean dirt to enable apple spawning.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,4). Dirt at (8,5), (7,4).
  Thinking: At (7,4), you are on a cell with dirt. You can **clean** this dirt (since you're on it), which will help make the river cleaner and allow apples to spawn on land. Cleaning dirt gives no points directly, but it's essential for enabling apple spawning.

There is also dirt at (8,5), which is not currently on your position — so you can't clean it yet.

**Action: clean**  
Reason: Cleaning the dirt at (7,4) is necessary to improve the river's cleanliness and enable future apple spawning. Without cleaning, no apples will spawn. You can't eat an apple yet, as there's none at your current position.  

After cleaning, you may later move to other cells to clean more dirt or eventually find apples.  

**Next step: clean → then consider moving to clean (8,5) if possible.**
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,7). Dirt at (6,8), (7,8), (7,6).
  Thinking: At (7,7), there is no apple currently. Dirt is at (6,8), (7,8), and (7,6) — all of which are adjacent but not directly on your position.

- You cannot eat an apple because none are present.
- You can only clean dirt if you are on the same cell as the dirt. Since you're at (7,7), and the dirt is at (6,8), (7,8), and (7,6), you are not on any of those cells.

Thus, **you cannot clean any dirt right now**, and **you cannot eat any apples**.

Best action: **stay** — to remain in position and possibly move toward a dirt cell in the future when you can clean it.

**Reasoning**: Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apples to spawn, but it gives no points. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is removed), and currently no dirt is on your cell, you must first move to a dirt cell to clean it. But currently, you cannot reach any dirt cell without moving.

However, you are at (7,7), and dirt is at:
- (7,6) — directly below → can move down
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Dirt at (8,1), (6,0), (8,0).
  Thinking: At (8,0):  
- You are on a cell with dirt.  
- Dirt is at (8,0), (8,1), and (6,0).  

**Action:** `clean`  

**Reasoning:**  
You can only eat apples when the river is clean (i.e., when there's no dirt). But apples only spawn *on land* when the river is clean. Since you're currently on dirt at (8,0), you can't eat an apple yet. However, cleaning dirt gives no points directly, but it's necessary to make apples appear. Cleaning (8,0) removes dirt from that cell, which helps improve the river's cleanliness and may allow apples to spawn later.  

**Next step:** After cleaning (8,0), check if other dirt cells (like (8,1) or (6,0)) can be cleaned next. But since you can only act on your current position, you must first clean (8,0).

--- Step 5 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,4). Dirt at (8,5).
  Thinking: You are at (7,4). Dirt is at (8,5).  

To clean dirt, you must be on the same cell as the dirt. You are not on (8,5), so you cannot clean it directly.  

You can move to (8,5) to clean it. After cleaning, the river will become cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn on land — but note: cleaning dirt gives no points, only enabling apple spawning.  

Apples only spawn when the river is clean, and you can only eat apples when you're on a land cell with an apple.  

**Action: right** (to move to (8,4)) → then **down** (to (8,5)) to reach the dirt.  

After cleaning, you can move to nearby land cells to see if apples have spawned.  

**Best next step: move to (8,5) and clean.**  

→ **Action: right, then down, then clean**.  

(Reasoning: Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apples to spawn; without it, no apples appear. You must be on the dirt to clean it.)
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,6). Dirt at (7,6), (8,5).
  Thinking: At (7,6): There is dirt here.  
Dirt also at (8,5).  

**Action:** clean  

**Reasoning:** I am on a cell with dirt (7,6), and cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apples to spawn. Since apples only appear on land when the river is clean, cleaning this dirt is essential. Eating apples gives points, but only after cleaning. I cannot eat an apple here yet because there's no apple — only dirt. Cleaning (7,6) will help make the area cleaner and potentially allow apples to spawn later.  

**Next step:** After cleaning (7,6), I may explore or move to check if apples appear or if I can clean (8,5) next.  

→ **Action: clean**
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,6). Dirt at (7,7), (7,6).
  Thinking: At (7,6), you are on a cell with dirt. You can clean dirt only if you are on the same cell.  

Dirt at (7,6) and (7,7):  
- You are at (7,6), so you can clean the dirt at (7,6).  
- There's no apple currently at (7,6), and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned).  

**Action: clean**  
→ Cleaning (7,6) reduces dirt. This may enable apple spawning later, but cleaning gives no points.  

**Why not eat?**  
No apple is present at (7,6) — apples spawn only when the river (or land) is clean, which requires cleaning dirt.  

**Next step:** After cleaning (7,6), check if (7,7) is now clean or if apples can spawn. But currently, no apple is available.  

**Best action: clean**  

✅ Final action: **clean**
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first check if there's dirt to clean.

However, since nothing is visible, it's possible that you're on clean land or on a cell with no dirt. Without dirt, apples won't spawn. Therefore, to enable apple spawning, you need to **clean dirt** if present.

But since you can't see anything, and no dirt is visible, it's safest to **stay** and assess further. Alternatively, if movement is needed to find dirt, you should move to adjacent cells.

But based on the current state: *nothing in your view*, and you're at (7,0), there's no immediate dirt or apple.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: No visible dirt or apples. Cleaning or eating is not possible now. Staying allows you to monitor the environment or move strategically if new information appears.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,2), nothing is visible. Since there are no apples or dirt in sight, I cannot eat or clean immediately.  

First, I need to explore the environment to find dirt (to clean) or apples (to eat). Without any visible items, I must move to gather information.  

Action: **right**  
Reason: Moving right may reveal dirt or apples. Exploration is necessary before cleaning or eating.
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,6). Dirt at (7,7).
  Thinking: At (7,6), there is no apple visible. Dirt is at (7,7), which is directly below you. Since you can only clean dirt when you are on the same cell, you must move to (7,7) to clean it.

**Action: down**  
→ Move to (7,7) to clean the dirt.  

After cleaning, the river will be slightly cleaner, potentially enabling apple spawning in the future. However, cleaning itself gives no points.  

**Next step:** After cleaning, monitor the environment. If apples spawn (e.g., at (7,6) or nearby), you can then eat them.  

**Reasoning:** Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apples to spawn, so prioritize cleaning before attempting to eat. You cannot eat an apple unless it's present on your current cell.  

**Next action after cleaning:** Check if an apple appears at (7,6) or nearby. If yes, eat it. Otherwise, explore or wait.  

Current best move: **down**.
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first check if there's dirt to clean. Without any visible items, it's likely that your current cell or nearby cells may contain dirt.

However, since you can only clean dirt *at your position*, and there's nothing visible, you should **stay** to assess the situation more carefully. If there's no dirt here, you won't be able to clean or spawn apples.  

But since no apples are visible and no dirt is reported, it's possible you're in a neutral zone. To be safe and proactive, **stay** to maintain position and possibly detect dirt or apples in the next step.

**Action: stay**.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,2), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apples to spawn, you must first clean dirt — but dirt is not visible, so you can't act on it.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: Without seeing dirt or apples, you cannot perform a valid clean or eat action. Staying allows you to remain in a position where you can later detect or interact with the environment if changes occur. Moving without information risks missing opportunities or wasting steps.  

→ **Stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,5), nothing is visible, so I don't know if there's dirt or an apple. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points, I must first check if there's dirt to clean.  

Without any visible items, I cannot eat an apple. Therefore, the safest and most logical first step is to **clean** if dirt is present — but since I don't know, I must explore.  

However, I have no information about surroundings. So, I should **move** to explore.  

Best action: **up** (to check what's in front).  

Reasoning: I need to discover dirt or apples. Without movement, I can't proceed. Exploring is necessary to find dirt (to clean) or apples (to eat).  

→ **Action: up**
  Decision: 'up' -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first check if there's dirt to clean. However, since nothing is visible, you cannot assume dirt is present.

Action: **stay**  
Reasoning: Without any visible items, moving would risk missing a potential dirt or apple. Staying allows you to assess the environment more carefully. If dirt appears later, you can act accordingly. Clean only if dirt is present—right now, nothing is visible.

--- Step 39 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,2), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean yet. To enable apples to spawn, you must first clean dirt. However, since nothing is visible, there's no dirt to clean, and no apples to eat.

**Reasoning**: Without sight of dirt or apples, no action can be taken. You must move to a location where dirt or apples are visible to proceed.

**Best action: stay** (to maintain position and wait for new information or to explore adjacent cells if more context is provided).  

But note: if the game only updates visibility upon movement, you should *move* to explore. Since the user says "nothing in your view," and you're at (8,2), you likely need to explore.

**Better action: left** (to check adjacent cell and possibly find dirt or apples).  

→ **Action: left**.
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,6). Dirt at (7,7).
  Thinking: You are at (7,6). Dirt is at (7,7), which is directly below you.  

Action: **down**  
→ Move to (7,7) to clean the dirt.  

Reasoning: Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning, and apples only appear on land when the river is clean. Since you can only clean dirt at your current position, you must move to (7,7) to clean it. This action is essential to eventually allow apples to spawn and be eaten for points.  

Next step: After cleaning, check if apples appear (though not visible here), then move to eat apples if available.  

  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (7,2), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (8,1), you are not on any dirt, so you cannot clean. There's no apple visible at your position.  

Dirt is at (7,2) and (6,0) — both are not adjacent to you. You can only clean dirt if you're on the same cell. Since you're at (8,1), you can't reach those dirt cells directly without moving.  

**Action:** Stay.  
**Reasoning:** You cannot clean dirt or eat an apple from your current position. Moving would be pointless without a clear path or target. The river is not clean yet (dirt exists), so apples won’t spawn. Cleaning dirt requires being on it — currently, you are not. Therefore, staying is optimal to avoid wasted moves.  

→ **Action: stay**

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,3). Dirt at (7,4), (7,2). Agent 2 at (7,4).
  Thinking: At (6,3), you are not on any dirt. Dirt is at (7,4) and (7,2), but Agent 2 is currently at (7,4), which may mean that cell is occupied or being monitored.

You can only clean dirt **if you are on the same cell**. Since you are at (6,3), you cannot clean (7,4) or (7,2) directly.

There are no apples mentioned, and apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. Since you can't clean dirt from your current position, and no apples are present yet, **you cannot eat an apple**.

Best action: **move toward (7,4) or (7,2)** to reach dirt and clean it.

But note: Agent 2 is at (7,4). If Agent 2 is blocking or claiming that cell, you may not be able to clean it.

→ **Best action: move down to (7,3)** (a step closer to (7,4) and (7,2)), then assess.

But if (7,4) is occupied by Agent 2, you cannot clean it.

→ Therefore, **move to (7,2
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,4). Dirt at (7,4). Agent 1 at (6,3).
  Thinking: At (7,4), there is dirt. Since dirt must be cleaned to enable apples to spawn, and cleaning dirt gives no points directly, I must clean it to potentially enable apple spawning later.

Action: **clean**  
Reasoning: I am on a cell with dirt. Cleaning it is necessary to make the land clean (which allows apples to spawn). Without cleaning, no apples can appear. I cannot eat an apple here yet because there is no apple — only dirt. Cleaning is the first required step.  

Next step will depend on whether apples spawn after cleaning.
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (7,2), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (8,1), you are not on any dirt, so you can't clean yet. Dirt is at (7,2) and (6,0) — both are not adjacent to your current position.  

To clean dirt, you must move to a cell with dirt and then use "clean". But you can't clean from (8,1) directly.  

First, you need to move to one of the dirt cells:  
- (7,2): adjacent to (8,1)? Yes — one step left then up (left from (8,1) is (7,1), then up to (7,2)).  
- (6,0): not adjacent — requires moving left and down, but (6,0) is far.  

So the closest dirt is at (7,2).  

**Action plan**:  
1. Move left to (7,1)  
2. Move up to (7,2)  
3. Clean the dirt at (7,2)  
4. After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner → apples may spawn (but only on land cells when river is clean)  
5. Then, if apples spawn on land, you can move to eat them  

But: **eating

--- Step 16 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,3). Dirt at (7,2). Agent 2 at (7,4).
  Thinking: At (7,3), there is dirt at (7,2) directly below you. Agent 2 is at (7,4), above you. 

Since you can only clean dirt *at your current position*, you cannot clean the dirt at (7,2) unless you move there. However, you are currently at (7,3), and the dirt is at (7,2), which is one cell below — so you must move down to (7,2) to clean it.

Cleaning dirt gives no points, but it’s necessary to improve the river’s cleanliness, which enables apples to spawn. Once the river is clean, apples can appear on land — and then you can eat them for +1.0 points each.

Currently, there’s no apple visible, and the river is not clean (due to dirt at (7,2)). So, to enable apple spawning, you must clean the dirt.

**Action: down** → move to (7,2) to clean the dirt.

After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn on land (though no specific apple locations are given). Then, you can move to a land cell with an apple to eat it.

**Next step after cleaning:** Check for
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,4). Agent 1 at (7,3).
  Thinking: At (7,4), there's no mention of dirt or an apple currently. Agent 1 is at (7,3), which is directly above you — but that doesn't imply anything about your current cell.

Since you can only eat apples or clean dirt **on your current cell**, and there's no indication of dirt or an apple at (7,4), your best action is to **check your surroundings**.

But based on the rules:
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt).
- Cleaning dirt gives **no points**, but is necessary for apples to spawn.
- You can only act on your current cell.

**Current situation**: No dirt or apple mentioned at (7,4). So, you cannot eat or clean unless there’s dirt or an apple.

**Best action**: **Stay** — to assess whether dirt or apples appear. If there's dirt, you might need to clean it to enable apple spawning. If no dirt, then no action is needed.

👉 **Action: stay**.  

(Reason: No apple or dirt detected; staying allows monitoring for changes or future opportunities.)
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Dirt at (7,2), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (7,1), you can see dirt at (7,2) and (6,0).  

- You **cannot eat** an apple right now because there's no apple visible on your cell.  
- You **can clean** dirt only if you're on the same cell as it.  
  - You are at (7,1), so you **cannot clean (7,2)** (it's directly above you, not on your cell).  
  - (6,0) is far away — not reachable without movement.  

Thus, **no action gives immediate points**.  

**Best next step**: Move to a cell with dirt to clean it.  
- Move **down** to (8,1)? No dirt.  
- Move **left** to (6,1)? No dirt.  
- Move **up** to (6,1)? Still no dirt.  
- Move **right** to (8,1)? No dirt.  

Wait — only dirt at (7,2) and (6,0).  
To clean (7,2), you need to go to (7,2).

--- Step 17 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Dirt at (7,2). Agent 3 at (8,1).
  Thinking: At (7,2), there is dirt, and you can only clean dirt or eat apples from your current position. Since there's dirt here, you can perform a **clean** action to remove it. Cleaning dirt doesn't give points, but it's necessary to enable apples to spawn later.

Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning, cleaning dirt in areas that affect the river (or nearby) will eventually allow apples to appear. However, currently, there's no apple visible, and the only action available is to clean.

**Action: clean**  
Reason: Cleaning the dirt at (7,2) is necessary to potentially enable apple spawning in the future. Eating is not possible now because there's no apple. Staying or moving doesn't help directly. Cleaning is the only useful action.
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,4). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,4), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately.  

**Reasoning:**  
- To eat apples, there must be an apple on the grid, which only spawns when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned).  
- You can only clean dirt or eat apples *at your current position*.  
- Since nothing is visible, there's no dirt to clean or apple to eat.  

**Action:** stay  
→ This maintains your position and allows you to detect changes if anything appears later.  

**Next step:** Monitor the environment. If dirt appears, clean it. If apples appear after cleaning, then eat them.  

**Action: clean** ✅
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Dirt at (8,1), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (8,0), you see dirt at (8,1) and (6,0). You cannot eat an apple yet because there are no apples spawned — apples only appear when the river is clean, which depends on dirt being cleaned.

Action plan:
- You are at (8,0). The dirt at (8,1) is directly above you — you can clean it.
- The dirt at (6,0) is to the left — you would need to move there first to clean it.

But cleaning dirt gives no points, only enables apple spawning.

Best immediate action: **clean (8,1)** — you are adjacent and can do it now.

After cleaning (8,1), the river gets cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn (though we don’t see apple locations). But since apples only spawn *on land* when the river is clean, and we don’t have apple spawn locations, we can’t eat yet.

So: **clean (8,1)** → improves river cleanliness → may allow future apple spawning.

**Action: clean** (at (8,1)) ✅

(Note: You cannot eat yet — no apples visible. Cleaning is necessary first.)

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,4). Dirt at (8,5).
  Thinking: You are at (8,4). Dirt is at (8,5), which is directly below you.  

Action: **down**  
→ Move to (8,5) to clean the dirt.  

Reasoning: You can only clean dirt if you're on the same cell. Since dirt is at (8,5), you must move there first. Cleaning dirt doesn't give points, but it's necessary to make apples spawn later (since apples only appear when the river is clean). After cleaning, you can then move around to find apples.  

Next step: After cleaning (8,5), check if apples have spawned—likely only on land cells when the river is clean. Then, if apples appear, you can eat them for +1.0 each.  

**Action: down** (to clean dirt at (8,5))
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,6). Dirt at (6,7), (8,5).
  Thinking: At (7,6), I see dirt at (6,7) and (8,5). I am not on any dirt, so I cannot clean it yet. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning I need to clean dirt to enable apple spawning.

Since I can only clean dirt when I'm on a cell with dirt, and I'm currently at (7,6), I must move to a dirt cell to clean it.

Options:
- (6,7): 1 cell up-left → reachable
- (8,5): 1 cell down-right → reachable

I can either go to (6,7) or (8,5) to clean.

Cleaning dirt gives no points, but enables apple spawning. Once the river is clean, apples may spawn on land, and I can then eat them for +1.0 each.

Best move: **Move to (6,7)** to clean it. That’s closer and allows me to start cleaning and eventually access apples.

Action: **left** (to go from (7,6) to (6,6))? Wait — (6,7) is up-left.

From (7,6):
- up → (6,6)
- left →

Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Dirt at (8,1), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (8,0), you see dirt at (8,1) and (6,0). You cannot eat an apple yet because there are no apples present — apples only spawn when the river is clean, which depends on removing dirt.

**Action: clean (8,1)**  
→ You are at (8,0), so you can only clean dirt on your current cell or adjacent cells? Wait — the rules say: *"You can only eat/clean items at your position."* So you can only clean dirt **if it's on your current cell**.

Dirt is at (8,1) and (6,0), neither of which is your current position (8,0). So you **cannot clean** those dirt cells directly.

Thus, **you cannot clean any dirt right now**.

Therefore, **no apples can spawn**, and you **cannot eat** any apple.

**Best action: stay**  
→ You remain at (8,0). No action gives points, and you can’t clean dirt or eat apples.

**Reasoning:** You are not on a dirt cell, so you can’t clean it. Without cleaning dirt, apples won’t spawn. Staying is safe and necessary to eventually move to a dirt cell

--- Step 7 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,3). Dirt at (7,2).
  Thinking: At (8,3), you are not on dirt, so you can't clean it directly. Dirt is at (7,2), which is not adjacent to your current position. You must move to (7,2) to clean it.  

**Action: move left to (7,3)**  
Then move down to (7,2) to clean the dirt.  

Cleaning dirt doesn’t give points, but it enables apple spawning on land — so eventually, apples may appear. After cleaning, you can return to (8,3) or move around to find apples.  

**Next step: clean (7,2)** → then check for apples.  

**Reasoning:** You must clean dirt to enable apples. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt), cleaning is necessary even though it gives no points.  

✅ Action: **move left to (7,3)**  
Then **move down to (7,2)** and **clean**.
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,6). Dirt at (6,7), (8,5).
  Thinking: At (6,6), I see dirt at (6,7) and (8,5). Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when there's no dirt), and I can only clean dirt *at my current position*, I cannot clean (8,5) from (6,6).

So, I can only clean dirt if I am on a cell with dirt. I am at (6,6), and (6,7) is directly below me. So I can:

- Move to (6,7) to clean the dirt there.

Cleaning dirt gives no points, but it's necessary to enable apples to spawn later. After cleaning (6,7), the river will be cleaner in that area, potentially allowing apples to appear on land nearby.

Currently, there are no apples visible, so I cannot eat one.

**Action: move down to (6,7) to clean the dirt.**

→ Reason: Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning. I can only clean dirt from my current position, so I must move to (6,7) to clean it. After that, the environment may allow apples to spawn, enabling future eating.
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Dirt at (8,1), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (8,0), you see dirt at (8,1) and (6,0).  

- You cannot eat an apple yet because there are no apples present (apples only spawn when the river is clean, which depends on dirt being cleaned).  
- You can **clean** dirt only if you are on the same cell as the dirt.  
- You are at (8,0), so you can **clean (8,1)** if you move there, but currently you are not on that cell.  
- You are currently on (8,0), which has no dirt — so you cannot clean anything here.  

**Best action: move to (8,1) to clean the dirt there.**  

Cleaning dirt at (8,1) will help make the river cleaner, which may eventually allow apples to spawn.  

→ **Action: right** (to move to (8,1))  

Then, once there, you can **clean**.  

**Reasoning:** Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning. Without cleaning, no apples appear. So, prioritize cleaning dirt at your reachable positions.

--- Step 8 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,3). Dirt at (7,2).
  Thinking: You are at (7,3). There is dirt at (7,2), directly below you.  

Since you can only clean dirt *if you are on the same cell*, you cannot clean the dirt at (7,2) from (7,3).  

There are no apples mentioned, and apples only spawn when the river is clean — but currently, there's no indication the river is clean or that apples are present.  

**Action:** You cannot clean dirt at (7,2) from (7,3).  
**Best move:** Move to (7,2) to clean it.  

→ **Action: down**  

After cleaning the dirt at (7,2), the river will be cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn later. Cleaning itself gives no points, but enables future apple spawning.  

Current best action: **down**.
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately.  

First, you need to explore to find dirt (to clean) or apples (to eat). Cleaning dirt enables apple spawning, but cleaning itself gives no points. Apples only appear when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is reduced).  

Action: **right** (to explore the area and potentially find dirt or apples).  

Reasoning: Without any visible items, moving is necessary to discover usable resources. Starting with a directional move ensures progress toward finding dirt (to clean) and eventually apples.

--- Step 40 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,2), with nothing in view, I cannot see any apples or dirt. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when there's dirt to clean), and I can only clean or eat what is directly at my position, I must first check if there's dirt to clean.

However, since nothing is visible and no items are mentioned, I assume there is no dirt or apple at (7,2) currently.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: I have no information about dirt or apples at my current position. Moving would risk missing a potential opportunity, and without any visible items, cleaning or eating is not possible. Staying allows me to assess the situation if more information becomes available.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,5), nothing is visible, so I don't know if there's dirt or an apple. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points, I must first check if there's dirt to clean.

But since I see nothing, I cannot confirm the state of the cell. To be safe and follow the rules, I should **clean** if there's dirt — but I can't see it. Therefore, without visual confirmation, I cannot assume dirt exists.

Best action: **stay** — to remain in position and assess the situation (possibly detect dirt or apple in next step).  

**Action: stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first determine whether there's dirt to clean.

However, with nothing in view, it's likely that the current cell (8,0) is either clean or has no dirt. Without dirt, no apples can spawn, and you can't gain points from eating.

Action: **stay**  
Reason: You have no visible dirt to clean and no apples to eat. Staying allows you to monitor the environment or wait for changes (e.g., dirt appearing or apples spawning after cleaning elsewhere). Moving without information could lead to wasted steps.  

→ **Stay**

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,2), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apples to spawn, you must first clean dirt. However, since there's nothing in sight, it's likely no dirt is present here. 

Action: **stay**  
Reason: Without visible dirt or apples, cleaning or eating is not possible. Staying allows you to assess the environment further. If dirt appears later, you can act accordingly.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,5), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apple spawning, you must first clean dirt. However, without knowing if there's dirt nearby, you can't act.

**Best next step:** Move to a neighboring cell to investigate (e.g., check (6,5), (8,5), (7,4), or (7,6)) to see if there's dirt or an apple.  

**Reasoning:** You need to find dirt to clean, and only after cleaning can apples spawn. Without any visible items, staying or acting blindly won't help. Exploration is necessary.  

👉 Action: **right** (to (7,6)) to check surroundings.
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first check if there's dirt to clean. Without any visible items, it's likely that the area is currently empty or barren.

However, since apples only appear on land when the river is clean, and you can only clean dirt at your current position, you should first **clean** if dirt is present. But since you see nothing, it's possible that there's no dirt here.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: No visible items (no dirt or apples), so cleaning or eating is not possible. Staying allows you to monitor the environment or move strategically if new information becomes available. Moving without a clear reason could lead to missing opportunities.

--- Step 42 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,2), with nothing in view, I need to check my surroundings to determine if there's dirt to clean or an apple to eat. Since nothing is visible, I cannot confirm the state of the cell or adjacent cells.

However, I must remember:
- I can only clean dirt or eat apples **if I am on a cell with dirt or an apple**.
- Cleaning dirt gives no points but enables apple spawning (if the river is clean, apples appear).
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt).

Since I’m at (7,2) and see nothing, it's likely the cell is either clean or has no item. Without visual confirmation, I cannot assume dirt or an apple is present.

**Action: stay**  
→ Reason: I cannot confirm if there's dirt to clean or an apple to eat. Moving would risk missing a valuable opportunity. Staying allows me to assess the situation or wait for new information. If I later see dirt or an apple, I can act accordingly.  

**Final action: stay** ✅
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,5). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,5), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apple spawning, you need to clean dirt—however, you must first be on a cell with dirt to clean it. Without visibility, you don’t know if there's dirt or apples nearby.

**Reasoning:** You cannot eat or clean without knowing the state of the cell you're on. Since nothing is visible, assume the cell (8,5) may be clean or empty. Without dirt, no apples can spawn. Therefore, **you must explore** to find dirt to clean.

**Action: left**  
(To investigate adjacent cells and find dirt to clean, which will eventually allow apples to spawn.)
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first check if there's dirt to clean. Without any visible items, it's likely the area is clean or empty.

However, since apples only spawn *when* the river is clean, and you're at (8,0), you should first investigate the surrounding cells to determine if there's dirt to clean. But since nothing is visible, and you can't see beyond your position, you must act cautiously.

Best action: **stay** — to assess the situation further. If you move, you might miss something important. Staying allows you to potentially detect dirt or apples in your current cell if they appear later. But since nothing is visible now, and no action is possible without sight, **stay** is the safest and most logical choice.

**Final action: stay** ✅
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (7,2), (6,0). Agent 1 at (7,2).
  Thinking: You are at (8,1).  
Dirt is at (7,2) and (6,0).  
Agent 1 is at (7,2) — which is a dirt cell.

**Key points:**
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when there's no dirt).
- Cleaning dirt gives no points, but is necessary to enable apple spawning.
- You can only clean or eat from your current cell.

**Current situation:**
- You are at (8,1), not on dirt.
- Dirt is at (7,2) and (6,0), both of which are not currently accessible to you.
- Agent 1 is at (7,2), which has dirt — so that cell is currently dirty.

**Action analysis:**
- You cannot clean (7,2) or (6,0) directly because you're not on those cells.
- You cannot eat any apple because no apple is currently spawning (river is dirty).
- To enable apples, you must clean dirt — but you can only clean from your current position.

**Conclusion:**
You must move to a dirt cell to clean it.  
The closest dirt cell is (7,2), which is adjacent

--- Step 18 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Agent 3 at (7,1).
  Thinking: At (7,2), I am not on a dirt cell, and there's no apple visible. Agent 3 is at (7,1), directly above me. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and I currently have no dirt to clean or apple to eat, I should **stay** to assess the situation.

However, if there's dirt nearby (especially in the river or adjacent cells), I might need to move to clean it. But based on current info, no dirt or apple is mentioned.

**Action: stay**  
→ Reason: No apple available to eat, and no dirt to clean. Staying is safe and allows monitoring for changes.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,4). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,4), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apples to spawn, the river must be clean—so dirt must be cleaned. However, you can only clean dirt if you're on a cell with dirt. Without knowing what's around you, you can't assume dirt exists.

**Best action: stay**  
Reason: You need to explore first to determine if there's dirt to clean or apples to eat. Staying allows you to assess the situation without moving into unknown territory. If dirt is present, you can clean it. If not, you may need to move to find a better location.  

→ **Action: stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Dirt at (6,0). Agent 1 at (7,2).
  Thinking: At (7,1), there is no apple currently. Dirt is at (6,0), which is not adjacent to you. You cannot eat an apple because none is present on your cell. Cleaning dirt requires being on the same cell as the dirt, which you are not. 

Best action: **move to (6,0)** to clean the dirt.  
After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner, which increases apple spawning chances. Once clean, apples may appear on land, and you can then move to eat them.

Action: **left** (to move to (6,1)), then **down** to (6,0) to clean.  

But wait — from (7,1), moving left to (6,1), then down to (6,0)? That's possible.  

However, the most direct path to (6,0) is:  
- From (7,1), move **left** to (6,1)  
- Then **down** to (6,0)  

But you can only clean dirt when on that cell.  

So:  
**Action: left** → now at (6,1)  
Then: **down** → now at (6,0) → **clean**

--- Step 19 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Agent 3 at (6,1).
  Thinking: At (7,2), I am on land. There's no apple visible, and I don't see any dirt to clean. Agent 3 is at (6,1), which is off my direct path and likely not relevant unless there's a threat or competition.  

Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and I currently have no dirt to clean, I cannot spawn apples.  

**Action: stay**  
I remain at (7,2) to monitor the environment. If dirt appears or if I can move to a location with dirt to clean, I can act accordingly. Eating is not possible without an apple, and cleaning is not possible without dirt.  

**Reasoning**: No immediate benefit in moving; staying allows for future action when dirt is present or when apple spawning conditions are met.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,4). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,4), nothing is visible. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first check if there's dirt to clean. Without any visible items, I cannot eat an apple.  

Action: **clean** (if dirt is present) — but since nothing is visible, I cannot confirm.  

Best course: **stay** to assess the situation.  

→ **Stay** (to maintain position and wait for information or potential dirt to appear).
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,1). Dirt at (6,0). Agent 1 at (7,2).
  Thinking: At (6,1), there is dirt at (6,0) directly below you. Since you can only clean dirt if you're on the same cell, you must **move down to (6,0)** to clean it.

Cleaning dirt does not give points, but it is necessary to improve the river's cleanliness, which in turn enables apples to spawn on land. Once the river is clean, apples may appear, and you can then eat them for +1.0 points each.

**Action: down**  
→ Move to (6,0) to clean the dirt.  
(Reason: Cleaning is required to enable apple spawning; without it, no apples can appear.)

--- Step 20 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,2), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately.  

**Reasoning:**  
- To eat apples, the river must be clean (i.e., dirt must be cleaned), and apples only spawn on land when the river is clean.  
- Since you see nothing, there's no apple to eat, and no dirt to clean at your current position.  
- Without dirt to clean, apples won't spawn.  

**Action:** stay  
→ Wait to observe changes or move to a location where dirt or apples might be visible.  

**Next step:** Explore adjacent cells to find dirt or apples.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,4). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,4), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apple spawning, you must first clean dirt. However, without knowing if there's dirt at (7,4), you can't act.

But the rule says: *Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (less dirt = more apples)*. So, if there's dirt, cleaning it is necessary — even if it gives no points, it's a prerequisite.

Since you see nothing, assume there's no visible dirt or apple. To proceed, you must **clean** if dirt is present. But since you don’t know, and you can only act on your current cell, the safest first step is to **check your surroundings** — but you can't see anything.

Thus, **you must assume there's no apple, and if there is dirt, cleaning it is needed**.

Best action: **clean** — because it’s necessary to enable apple spawning, even if it gives no points.

✅ Action: **clean**
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Dirt at (6,0).
  Thinking: You are at (6,0), and there is dirt at your position.  

Action: **clean**  
Reason: You can only eat apples when there is clean land, and apples only spawn on clean land. Since you're currently on dirt, you must clean it first to enable apple spawning. Cleaning dirt gives no points directly, but it's necessary to unlock the ability to eat apples later.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,5). Dirt at (7,6), (7,4).
  Thinking: At (5,5), I am not on any dirt, so I can't clean it yet. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — currently, there's dirt at (7,6) and (7,4), so the river isn't clean yet, meaning no apples are spawning.

To enable apple spawning, I must clean the dirt. I need to move to a dirt cell to clean it.

Best action: **move right to (6,5)** — not directly on dirt, but closer to (7,6) and (7,4). Then move to (7,5) to reach (7,6) or (7,4)? Wait — (7,6) and (7,4) are both on row 7.

From (5,5), go **down to (6,5)**, then **down to (7,5)** — now I'm at (7,5), adjacent to both (7,6) and (7,4). But I can only clean one cell at a time.

Best path:  
- Move down to (6,5)  
- Then down to (7,5)  
- Now I can **clean (7,6)** or

Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — currently, dirt is at (7,8) and (7,6), which are not adjacent to you. To enable apple spawning, you must clean dirt, but cleaning only happens *on your current cell*. Since you are not on dirt, you can't clean it directly.

**Action:** Move toward a dirt cell (e.g., left to (8,7), then to (7,7)) to reach a position where you can clean dirt and eventually enable apple spawning.

**Best next step:** `left` to (8,7) — to get closer to the dirt at (7,8) and (7,6).  

**Reasoning:** Cleaning dirt is necessary to spawn apples, and you must be on a dirt cell to clean it. You cannot eat apples now, so focus on cleaning first.
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (9,0). Dirt at (8,1), (8,0).
  Thinking: At (9,0), you are adjacent to dirt at (8,0) and (8,1). Since you can only clean dirt if you are on the same cell, you cannot clean (8,0) or (8,1) directly.

To clean dirt, you must move to a cell with dirt. The closest dirt is at (8,0) — directly to the left. Move left to (8,0).

Now you're at (8,0), which has dirt. Clean it. Cleaning gives no points, but enables apple spawning if the river becomes clean.

After cleaning (8,0), check if apples can spawn. Apples spawn only when the river is clean — meaning no dirt on land. Since (8,1) still has dirt, the river is not fully clean, so no apples spawn.

Now, you must decide: move to (8,1) to clean it, or stay and wait?

Move to (8,1) — clean it. Now all dirt is removed. River is clean → apples can spawn.

But apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Since you're at (8,1), and it was dirt, cleaning it removes dirt. After cleaning both (8,

--- Step 2 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,5). Dirt at (7,6), (8,5), (7,4).
  Thinking: At (6,5), I see dirt at (7,6), (8,5), and (7,4). I am not on any dirt, so I cannot clean yet. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning I must clean dirt to enable apple spawning.

To maximize points, I must first clean dirt, but only where I am. Since I’m at (6,5), I can only clean if dirt is at (6,5) — which it isn’t. So I cannot clean any dirt right now.

Available actions:  
- Move to a neighboring cell (up, down, left, right) to potentially reach dirt.  
- Stay — no benefit.  
- Clean — not possible.  
- Eat — no apple at (6,5), so cannot eat.

Best next step: **Move to (8,5)** — that’s where dirt is. From there, I can clean (8,5). After cleaning, the area becomes land, which may allow apple spawning.

**Action: right → (7,5)** — wait, (7,5) is not listed as dirt. Let’s check:

Dirt at: (7,6), (8,5), (7
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,7). Dirt at (6,8), (7,8), (7,6).
  Thinking: At (8,7), you are not on any dirt cells. Dirt is at (6,8), (7,8), (7,6) — all of which are not adjacent to your current position.

To eat an apple, the river must be clean (i.e., dirt must be cleaned), and apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Since you're not on any dirt, you cannot clean it directly.

**Action plan:**
- Move to a dirt cell to clean it.
- Clean dirt to make the river cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn on land.
- Then, if apples appear, you can eat them.

**Best first move:**
Move left to (7,7) — adjacent to (7,8) and (7,6), so you can eventually reach dirt.

But better: move to (7,8) — directly adjacent to (7,8) dirt.

→ **Action: left** to (7,7) — not directly on dirt.

Wait: (7,8) is dirt. You are at (8,7).  
→ Move **up** to (7,7), then **right** to (7,8) to clean dirt.

**Step-by-step
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Dirt at (8,1), (6,0), (8,0).
  Thinking: You are at (8,0).  
Dirt is at (8,1), (6,0), and (8,0) — so there's dirt at your current position.

**Action analysis:**
- You **can clean dirt** only if you are on a cell with dirt.
- Cleaning dirt gives **no points**, but it's necessary to enable apples to spawn later.
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned.

**Current situation:**
- You are on (8,0), which has dirt.  
- You can **clean** that dirt (no points, but necessary).
- There's also dirt at (8,1) and (6,0), but you can't reach them without moving.

**Best immediate action:**  
→ **clean** (at (8,0))  

This removes dirt from your current cell, which may help enable future apple spawning (especially if apples are near or on land adjacent to clean areas).

After cleaning, you can consider moving to check other dirt or look for apples.

**Final decision:**  
✅ **clean**

--- Step 3 ---
**Reasoning:** Clean the dirt to improve conditions for apples. You must move to the dirt cell to clean it.
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,5). Dirt at (8,5).
  Thinking: You are at (6,5). Dirt is at (8,5), which is to your right.  

Action: **right**  
Reason: You need to move to (8,5) to clean the dirt. Cleaning dirt doesn't give points, but it's necessary to make apples spawn (and eventually allow you to eat them). Once the dirt is cleaned, apples may appear on land, enabling you to earn points.  

After cleaning, you can assess if apples have spawned and decide whether to eat them.  

**Next step: right → clean**
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (9,0). Dirt at (8,1).
  Thinking: At (9,0), you are not on any dirt, so you cannot clean. There's dirt at (8,1), which is adjacent but not currently accessible. You cannot eat an apple because there's no apple visible at your position.  

To maximize points:  
- You must first **move to (8,1)** to clean the dirt.  
- Cleaning dirt doesn't give points, but it improves the river's cleanliness, enabling apples to spawn.  

**Action: left** → move to (8,1)  
Then: **clean** → clean the dirt at (8,1)  

After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner, which may eventually allow apples to spawn on land. Then, you can move to land cells with apples and eat them.  

**Next step: left** (to (7,1)) or check if apples appear — but currently, no apples are visible.  

**Reasoning:** Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning. Without cleaning, no apples can spawn, so eating is impossible. Prioritize cleaning adjacent dirt.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Dirt at (7,2), (8,1).
  Thinking: At (7,2): There is dirt here, so I can clean it. Cleaning dirt gives no points, but it's necessary to enable apples to spawn. After cleaning (7,2), the river becomes cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn in the future.  

Currently, there's no apple at (7,2), and the only other dirt is at (8,1). I cannot eat anything yet.  

Action: **clean** (to remove dirt at (7,2))  

Reasoning: Cleaning dirt is required to enable apple spawning. I must clean first to progress toward eating apples.
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Dirt at (8,5).
  Thinking: You are at (7,5). There is dirt at (8,5), which is to your right.  

Action: **right**  
→ Move to (8,5) to clean the dirt.  

Reasoning: You can only clean dirt or eat apples at your current position. Since there's dirt at (8,5) and you're at (7,5), you must move there first to clean it. Cleaning dirt doesn't give points, but it's necessary to improve the river's cleanliness, which increases the chance of apples spawning later.  

Next, after cleaning, you can potentially move back or explore further. But right now, the best immediate action is to **move right** to clean the dirt.  

✅ Action: **right**
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Dirt at (8,1), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (8,0), you see dirt at (8,1) and (6,0).  

- You **cannot eat** an apple right now because there's no apple visible. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned.  
- You can **clean dirt** only if you are on the same cell as the dirt.  
- You are at (8,0), so you can **clean (8,1)** if you move there — but you can't clean (6,0) from (8,0) directly.  

**Best action**: Move to (8,1) to clean the dirt there.  
After cleaning (8,1), the river becomes cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn on land (though spawning isn't directly visible).  

**Next step**: After cleaning, check if apples appear — but currently, no apples are visible.  

**Immediate action**: `right` → no, (8,1) is directly above (8,0). So:  

➡️ **Action: up** → move to (8,1)  
Then: **clean**  

After that, you can monitor for apple spawns.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Dirt at (8,1). Agent 3 at (8,1).
  Thinking: You are at (7,2). Dirt is at (8,1), and Agent 3 is also at (8,1).  

Since you can only clean dirt **at your current position**, and you are not on (8,1), you **cannot clean the dirt there**.  
There's no apple spawn mentioned, and apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — but since you're not on dirt, you can't clean it to enable apple spawning.  

Currently, you can't eat (no apple at (7,2)), and you can't clean dirt at (8,1) because you're not there.  

**Best action: Move to (8,1) to clean the dirt.**  
→ Move right to (8,2), then down to (8,1) to clean.  

After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn on land nearby. Then you can return and eat if apples appear.  

**Action: right** (to (8,2)) → then eventually down to (8,1) to clean.  

But right now, only valid immediate action: **right**.  

✅ **Action: right**
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,5). Dirt at (8,5).
  Thinking: You are at (8,5), and there is dirt at your position.  

Action: **clean**  
Reason: You can only eat apples when there is clean land, and apples only spawn on clean land. Since you're on dirt, you must clean it first to make space for apples. Cleaning dirt gives no points directly, but it's essential to enable apple spawning.  

After cleaning, you’ll be on clean land at (8,5), which may allow apples to spawn (depending on river cleanliness). Then, you can consider eating if an apple appears.  

→ **Action: clean**
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (8,1), (6,0). Agent 1 at (7,2).
  Thinking: At (8,1): There is dirt here.  
Dirt also at (6,0).  
Agent 1 is at (7,2).  

**Action:** `clean`  

**Reasoning:**  
- I am on a cell with dirt (8,1). Cleaning it is necessary to make the river clean (which enables apple spawning).  
- Eating apples gives points, but only if apples spawn — which only happens when the river is clean.  
- Cleaning dirt gives no points directly, but without it, no apples can spawn.  
- I must clean dirt at my position first to enable future apple spawning.  
- I cannot eat an apple here yet because there's no apple (apples only spawn when river is clean, and that depends on dirt being cleaned).  

**Next step:** After cleaning (8,1), I can assess whether apples now spawn and if I can move to a position where apples are available.  

→ Action: **clean**

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,2). Agent 3 at (8,1).
  Thinking: At (8,2), I am not on a dirt cell, and there's no apple visible. Agent 3 is at (8,1), which is directly above me. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and I have no dirt to clean here, I cannot spawn apples.

I should check if there's dirt nearby to clean—perhaps moving up to (8,1) to see if Agent 3 is cleaning dirt or if I can interact. But since I can only clean or eat what's on my current cell, and I’m not on dirt, I can't clean.

Best action: **up** to (8,1) to check Agent 3’s status or see if there’s dirt there to clean.  

→ **Action: up**
  Decision: 'up' -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,5). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,5), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apples to spawn, the river must be clean—meaning dirt must be cleaned. However, cleaning dirt gives no points, only enables apple spawning.

Since you can't see anything, you must explore to find dirt or apples. The best next step is to **move** in a direction to explore the environment.

**Action: left**  
(Reasoning: Moving left from (8,5) to (7,5) may reveal dirt or other terrain. Without visibility, exploration is necessary before cleaning or eating. Cleaning only happens on your current cell, so you must first locate dirt.)

--- Step 43 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,2), with nothing in view, I need to check what's around me. Since I can only act on what's directly at my position (i.e., dirt or apples), and there's nothing visible, I must assume the current cell is either empty or contains dirt (no apple yet).

To spawn apples, the river must be clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. Since apples don’t spawn on dirty land, and I can’t see anything, I should first **clean** if there's dirt. But since nothing is visible, I can’t confirm.

However, the only action that enables apple spawning is cleaning dirt. So, if I assume the cell might contain dirt (as no apple is visible), I should **clean** to potentially enable apple spawning.

**Action: clean**  
Reason: Cleaning dirt is necessary to allow apples to spawn. Without cleaning, no apples can appear. I can’t eat an apple I don’t see, so I must first ensure the environment is clean.
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,5), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately.  

First, you need to explore to find dirt (to clean) or apples (to eat). Cleaning dirt enables apples to spawn, so cleaning is necessary for future apple collection.  

**Action: left**  
→ Move to (6,5) to explore adjacent cells and possibly find dirt or apples.  

Reasoning: Without any visible items, movement is required to discover resources. Cleaning only gives no points, but enables apple spawning. Thus, exploration is essential before any cleaning or eating.
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first determine whether there's dirt to clean.

However, with no visible items, it's likely that the current cell (8,0) is either clean or empty. Without dirt, you can't clean it, and without dirt being cleaned, apples won't spawn.

Action: **stay**  
Reasoning: Since nothing is visible and you can't eat or clean without a target, staying allows you to assess the environment. If you move, you might miss opportunities to clean dirt or find apples. Staying is safe and necessary to gather information before acting.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Dirt at (8,3).
  Thinking: At (7,2), you are not on any dirt. The dirt is at (8,3), which is adjacent but not currently reachable without moving.  

To clean dirt, you must be on the same cell as the dirt. Since you're at (7,2) and dirt is at (8,3), you need to move to (8,3) first.  

Action: **right** to (8,2), then **down** to (8,3).  

Now you're on the dirt at (8,3).  

Action: **clean** (this gives no points but enables apple spawning).  

After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn on land nearby. However, since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and we don’t have information about land positions, we cannot confirm apple availability yet.  

But the goal is to maximize points via eating apples. Since we can only eat apples when on a cell with one, and we don’t know where apples are, we should:  

- Clean the dirt to enable apple spawning.  
- Then, after apples spawn, move to a land cell with an apple and eat it.  

But currently, no apples are visible.
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,5). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,5), nothing is visible, so I don't know if there's dirt or an apple. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first check if there's dirt to clean.

However, with no visible items, I can't confirm if there's dirt or an apple. Without any information about the surroundings, I cannot take a safe action.

**Best action: stay**  
This maintains position and allows me to assess the environment or react to future updates. I cannot eat or clean without knowing if there's something to do.

**Reasoning:** No visible items mean no immediate action can be taken safely. Staying allows for observation or response to future updates.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To get apples, you first need to clean dirt to make the river clean—apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. However, without seeing dirt or apples, you can't act directly.

**Best next step:** Move to a location where dirt might be present (e.g., check adjacent cells) to clean it and eventually enable apple spawning.

**Action:** left (to (7,0)) — to explore and potentially find dirt to clean.  

Reasoning: Without dirt, no cleaning can occur, and no apples can spawn. Exploring adjacent cells is necessary to find dirt and start the process.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,2). Dirt at (8,3).
  Thinking: At (8,2), there is no apple currently. Dirt is at (8,3), which is directly below you.  

Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when there's no dirt), and dirt at (8,3) is not cleaned yet, we must first clean it to make the area clean and possibly allow apples to spawn.  

**Action: down** to move to (8,3) where the dirt is.  
**Action: clean** to remove the dirt.  

After cleaning, the area will be clean, which may allow apples to spawn on adjacent land cells (if any). However, since we only get points for eating apples, and no apple is currently visible, we must wait for one to spawn after cleaning.  

But since we can only act at our current position, and we now have cleaned the dirt, the next step would be to move to a land cell where apples might spawn (if any), or stay and wait.  

**Best immediate action: down, then clean.**  

After that, we can monitor for apple spawns.  

**Final action: down, clean.** ✅

Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,5). Dirt at (7,4).
  Thinking: You are at (6,5). Dirt is at (7,4).  

To clean dirt, you must be on the same cell as the dirt. You are not on (7,4), so you cannot clean it directly.  

You cannot eat an apple unless there is one on your current cell (6,5). Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — but since there's no indication of apples at (6,5), and the dirt is off-grid from your position, there's no apple to eat.  

**Best action: Move to (7,4) to clean the dirt.**  
After cleaning, the river will be cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn on land (including potentially near your position).  

→ Action: **right** (to move from (6,5) to (7,5)), then **down** to (7,4).  

Wait — (7,4) is not directly reachable from (6,5) in one step. From (6,5):  
- Right → (6,6)

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,2), with nothing in view, I cannot see any apples or dirt. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and I can only clean dirt or eat apples *at my current position*, I must first determine if there's dirt to clean.

But since nothing is visible, I cannot assume dirt is present. Without any visible items, I cannot perform a clean or eat action.

**Action: stay**  
Reasoning: I need to gather more information. Staying in place allows me to potentially detect changes or receive updates about the environment. Without visibility, I cannot take action safely.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,4). Dirt at (7,5).
  Thinking: You are at (7,4). There is dirt at (7,5), which is directly below you.  

Since you can only clean dirt when you are on the same cell as the dirt, you must **move down to (7,5)** to clean it.  

Cleaning dirt gives no points, but it's necessary to make the river clean (which enables apples to spawn). Once the river is clean, apples may appear on land — and you can then eat them for +1.0 points each.  

**Action: down** (to move to (7,5) and clean the dirt).  

After cleaning, you can assess if apples have spawned (though not visible here), and plan next steps accordingly.  

**Reasoning:** Cleaning dirt is required to enable apple spawning. You must act first to clean the dirt at (7,5).
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first check if there's dirt to clean.

However, with nothing in view, it's unclear whether there's dirt at (6,0). Since you can only clean dirt *at your position*, and eating apples requires being on a cell with an apple (which only spawns when dirt is cleaned), the safest first step is to **clean** if dirt is present.

But since you see nothing, it's possible the cell is clean or empty. Without confirmation, assume no apple is present yet.

**Action: clean**  
Reasoning: Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning. Even though cleaning gives no points, it's essential to create conditions for apples to appear. Without cleaning, no apples can spawn. Thus, clean at (6,0) to prepare for future apple spawning.

  Thinking: At (7,2), I am not on a dirt cell, and there's no apple visible. Agent 2 is at (7,3), which is directly above me. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points, I must first determine if there's dirt to clean nearby.

Currently, I am at (7,2). If there's dirt at (7,2), I can clean it — but that gives no points. If there's an apple at (7,2), I can eat it for +1.0. However, no apple or dirt is mentioned.

Since no apple is present and no dirt is specified, and I’m not told that the river is clean, I assume the current state is not favorable for apple spawning.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: No apple or dirt is visible at (7,2). Without confirming dirt or apple presence, moving or cleaning is unnecessary. Staying is safest and allows for observation of surroundings or potential changes.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,3). Agent 1 at (7,2).
  Thinking: At (7,3), I am not on an apple. Agent 1 is at (7,2), directly above me. There's no indication of dirt or apples in the current state. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points, I must first assess whether there's dirt to clean.

However, no dirt is mentioned, and no apple is visible. Therefore, I cannot eat an apple. 

Best action: **stay** — to monitor the environment for changes or to wait for dirt to appear (possibly from nearby cells), which would allow apple spawning after cleaning.

**Reasoning:** Without dirt to clean, no apples can spawn. Eating is not possible. Staying allows observation and potential future action when dirt becomes available.  

→ **Action: stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately.  

First, you need to explore to find dirt (to clean) or apples (to eat). Cleaning dirt enables apple spawning, but cleaning gives no points. Apples only appear when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is reduced).  

**Action: left**  
Move left to explore the area. The river might be nearby, and dirt could be present.  

**Reasoning:** Without any visible items, exploration is necessary. Moving left increases the chance of finding dirt to clean (enabling apples) or apples directly. Staying or moving randomly without exploration is inefficient.  

→ **Action: left**

--- Step 23 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Agent 2 at (7,3).
  Thinking: At (7,2), I am not on a dirt cell, and there's no apple visible. Agent 2 is at (7,3), which is directly above me. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and I have no dirt to clean here, I cannot spawn apples.

Action: **stay**  
Reason: I am currently at (7,2), which may be land or water. Without confirmation of dirt or apples, and since cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary for apples, I should not take action unless I can clean dirt. Since I have no dirt to clean here and no apple to eat, staying is safe and strategic. I should monitor the environment for dirt or apple spawns.  

→ **stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,3). Agent 1 at (7,2).
  Thinking: At (7,3), I am not on an apple or dirt. Agent 1 is at (7,2), which is directly above me.  

To maximize points:  
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned).  
- Cleaning dirt gives no points, but is necessary to enable apples.  
- I can only clean or eat what is directly at my position.  

Currently, there's no indication of dirt or apples at (7,3). Without dirt to clean, no apples can spawn.  

**Action: stay**  
Reason: I need to assess whether there's dirt or apples at my current position. If there's no dirt, I can't clean, and no apples will spawn. Staying allows me to observe or wait for a possible dirt spawn or movement. If I move, I might miss opportunities.  

→ **Stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (5,0), nothing is visible, so I don't know if there's dirt or an apple. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points, I must first determine whether there's dirt to clean.

But with no visible items, I can't assume dirt is present. Without any information about surroundings or current state, the safest action is to **stay** — this avoids risk and allows me to assess the environment if new information becomes available.

**Action: stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Dirt at (7,6), (8,5), (7,4).
  Thinking: At (7,5), I see dirt at (7,6), (8,5), and (7,4). I am not on any dirt, so I cannot clean yet. However, apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning I need to clean dirt to enable apple spawning.

Currently, I am at (7,5), which is land. The dirt cells are adjacent:  
- (7,6) — directly above me  
- (8,5) — to my right  
- (7,4) — directly below me  

I can only clean dirt if I am on the same cell as it. So I must move to one of these dirt cells to clean it.

**Best first step**: Move to (7,6) — directly above me. From there, I can clean (7,6).  
After cleaning (7,6), that dirt is gone, and the river is slightly cleaner — possibly enabling apple spawning on adjacent land.

Alternatively, cleaning (7,4) or (8,5) would also help, but (7,6) is adjacent and directly above — a good move.

**Action: up** → move to (7,6)  
Then: **clean** →
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,7). Dirt at (6,8), (7,8), (7,6).
  Thinking: At (7,7), I see dirt at (6,8), (7,8), and (7,6). I am not on any of those dirt cells, so I cannot clean them directly.  

To eat apples, the river must be clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. But cleaning dirt only happens when I am on the same cell as the dirt.  

Right now, I am at (7,7), which is not on any dirt cells. So I cannot clean any dirt. Therefore, no apples can spawn (since apples only appear when the river is clean).  

**Action: move to a dirt cell to clean it.**  
Best option: move to (7,6) or (7,8) to clean dirt.  

Let’s go to (7,6) — it's adjacent and directly left.  

**Action: left** → move to (7,6)  

Now I’m on dirt. I can clean it.  

**Action: clean** → removes dirt at (7,6)  

Now, dirt is reduced. If I continue cleaning adjacent dirt, the river becomes cleaner and apples may spawn.  

But since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and cleaning gives no points, I
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Dirt at (8,1), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (8,0), you see dirt at (8,1) and (6,0).  

- You cannot eat an apple yet because there are no apples present (apples only spawn when the river is clean, which requires cleaning dirt).  
- You can **clean** dirt only if you are on the same cell as the dirt.  
  - You are at (8,0), so you can clean dirt at (8,0) — but there's no dirt at (8,0).  
  - Dirt is at (8,1) and (6,0), so you must move to one of those to clean.  

**Best action: move up to (8,1)** to clean the dirt there.  

After cleaning (8,1), the river becomes cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn (though spawning isn't directly observable here). Then you can potentially move to (6,0) to clean that dirt.  

But **no apples are currently available** — so eating gives 0 points.  

**Action: up** (to (8,1)) → clean dirt.  

✅ Reasoning: Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning. You must first clean dirt to create conditions for apples. You

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,5). Dirt at (7,6), (8,5), (7,4).
  Thinking: At (8,5), you can see dirt at (7,6), (8,5), and (7,4). Since you are on (8,5), which has dirt, you can **clean** it. Cleaning dirt does not give points, but it's necessary to make apples spawn later.

- **Action: clean** at (8,5)  
→ Removes dirt from (8,5), which may help enable apple spawning in the future.

After cleaning, check if any apples can now spawn. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt). Since we reduced dirt at (8,5), and the river is likely tied to the surrounding area, this improves conditions.

But currently, no apples are visible. So, **eating is not possible** yet.

**Best action: clean**  
→ Reason: Cleaning dirt is required to enable apple spawning. Without cleaning, apples won't appear. Eating is not possible now.

**Next step**: After cleaning, monitor for apple spawns. If apples appear, then eat them.  

✅ Final action: **clean**
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,7). Dirt at (6,8), (7,8), (7,6).
  Thinking: At (6,7), you can see dirt at (6,8), (7,8), and (7,6). You cannot clean dirt unless you are on the same cell. Since you are at (6,7), you can only clean dirt if one of those dirt cells is adjacent and you move there.

- (6,8) is directly above you → can move up to clean it.
- (7,8) is diagonally up-right → not adjacent → cannot reach directly.
- (7,6) is down-left → not adjacent → cannot reach directly.

So, only (6,8) is reachable and adjacent.

**Action: Move up to (6,8)** → clean dirt.

After cleaning (6,8), dirt is gone. Now, the river is cleaner in that area, which may enable apple spawning — but apples only spawn *on land* when the river is clean, and you can only eat apples if you're on a cell with one.

But currently, there are no apples mentioned. You need to check if apples are now possible — but the problem doesn't specify apple locations. So unless apples spawn due to cleaner river, and we don't have data on that, we can't assume they are
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (7,2), (8,1), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (8,1), you are on a cell with dirt.  
Dirt is also at (7,2) and (6,0).  

You can only **clean dirt** if you are on the same cell as it.  
You can only **eat apples** if apples are present — but apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed).  

Currently, dirt is at (7,2), (8,1), and (6,0).  
Since you are at (8,1), you can **clean the dirt at (8,1)**.  

Cleaning (8,1) removes dirt from that cell — this helps make land cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn on adjacent land cells.  

But:  
- Cleaning dirt gives **0 points**.  
- Eating apples gives **+1.0** each.  
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — so we need to clean dirt to enable apples.  

Right now, there’s no apple visible. So we must first clean dirt to enable apple spawning.  

**Action: clean** (at (8,1))  

After cleaning, (8,1) becomes clean. This improves the river's

--- Step 5 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,5). Dirt at (7,6), (7,4).
  Thinking: At (8,5), you are not on any dirt, so you cannot clean. There are no apples visible at your position.  

Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — currently, dirt is at (7,6) and (7,4), which are not adjacent to you. To enable apple spawning, you must clean dirt, but cleaning only happens on your current cell.  

Since you're not on dirt, you can't clean. Therefore, you cannot enable apple spawning directly.  

Best action: **move toward a dirt cell** (e.g., left to (7,5)) to reach a dirt spot and clean it.  

→ **Action: left**  

Reasoning: Cleaning dirt is necessary to allow apples to spawn, and only by cleaning dirt can you eventually access apples. You must first reach a dirt cell to clean it.
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,7). Dirt at (6,8), (7,8), (7,6).
  Thinking: At (6,7), I see dirt at (6,8), (7,8), and (7,6). I am not on any dirt, so I cannot clean it yet. Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. Since I can only clean dirt if I'm on the same cell, I need to move to a dirt cell to clean it.

Options:
- Move to (6,8): adjacent, on dirt → can clean.
- Move to (7,8): adjacent, on dirt → can clean.
- Move to (7,6): adjacent, on dirt → can clean.

I should move to one of these to clean dirt. Cleaning dirt doesn't give points, but it enables apples to spawn later.

Best first step: **move down to (7,7)** — not on dirt, but closer to (7,6) and (7,8). But I can't clean from here.

Actually, I must move directly to a dirt cell to clean.

So, best immediate action: **move down to (7,7)** — not on dirt. Then move to (7,8) or (7,6).

→ **Action: left**
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (6,0). Agent 1 at (8,2).
  Thinking: At (8,1), there's no apple visible, and the only dirt is at (6,0), which is not adjacent to you. You cannot clean dirt or eat apples unless you're on a cell with dirt (to clean) or an apple (to eat).  

Since you're at (8,1), you are not adjacent to (6,0), so you can't clean it directly. Moving to (6,0) would require going left, down, or up—specifically, you'd need to go left to (7,1), then (6,1), then (6,0). But that's inefficient, and cleaning dirt gives no points.  

There are no apples mentioned at your location, so you can't eat.  

**Best action: stay**  
You are not in a position to clean dirt or eat apples immediately. Moving would not help, and cleaning dirt yields no points.  

**Final decision: stay**.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,3). Dirt at (8,2).
  Thinking: At (8,3), there is dirt at (8,2) — directly below you. Since you can only clean dirt when on your current cell, you cannot clean (8,2) from (8,3).  

To clean dirt, you must move to the cell with dirt. So, move **down** to (8,2), then clean it.  

After cleaning, the river will be cleaner (less dirt), which may enable apple spawning on land — but currently, there are no apples mentioned.  

**Action: down** (to reach (8,2))  
Then: clean (after moving)  

Reasoning: Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning, and you can't clean dirt from a distance. You must move to it first.
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,5), nothing is visible, so I don't know if there's dirt or an apple. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first check the surroundings.

However, with no visible items, I cannot confirm whether there's dirt to clean or an apple to eat. Since I can only act on my current cell, and there's nothing visible, I should **stay** to avoid moving into unknown areas and risking missing a potential apple or dirt.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: No visible items; cannot safely clean or eat without knowing the state of the current cell. Staying is the safest and most informed choice until more information is available.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (8,2), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (8,1), you are not on any dirt, so you can't clean. There's dirt at (8,2) and (6,0), both of which are not adjacent to your current position.  

To spawn apples, the river must be clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. Since you can only clean dirt when you're on the same cell, you must move to (8,2) to clean that dirt.  

Action: **move right** to (8,2)  
→ Then you can **clean** the dirt at (8,2).  

After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner, which increases the chance of apples spawning on land.  

Next, you may need to move to other land cells to eat apples. But currently, no apples are visible.  

**Best next step: move right to (8,2) and clean.**  

Reasoning: Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning, and you can only clean where you are. Without cleaning, no apples can spawn.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,2). Dirt at (8,2). Agent 3 at (9,1).
  Thinking: At (8,2), there is dirt, and you can clean it. Cleaning dirt gives no points directly, but it's necessary to enable apples to spawn on land. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt), cleaning the dirt at (8,2) will help create conditions for apples to appear. 

Agent 3 is at (9,1), which is not relevant to your current position unless there's an interaction rule—none is specified. 

**Action: clean**  
Reason: Cleaning the dirt at (8,2) is necessary to enable apple spawning in the future. Eating apples later will give +1.0 points each, so cleaning is a prerequisite for potential future gains.  

**Next step:** After cleaning, monitor for apple spawns. If apples appear, you can then eat them.
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,5), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately.  

**Reasoning:** To eat apples, the river must be clean (i.e., dirt must be cleaned), and apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Since you can't see anything, you must first explore to find dirt to clean or apples to eat.  

**Action:** *left* — explore to check the surroundings and locate dirt or apples.
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (9,1). Dirt at (8,2). Agent 1 at (8,2).
  Thinking: You are at (9,1). There is dirt at (8,2), and Agent 1 is currently there.  

Since you can only clean dirt **if you are on the same cell**, you cannot clean the dirt at (8,2) unless you move there.  

You cannot eat an apple unless one is present — and apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Right now, there's dirt at (8,2), so the river isn't clean, meaning no apples are spawning (at least not in that area).  

**Action**: Move to (8,2) to clean the dirt.  
After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn later.  

**Reasoning**: Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning. You cannot eat apples now because there are none (due to dirty river). Cleaning is required first.  

✅ Action: **left** (to move from (9,1) to (8,1)), then **down** to (8,2) — but wait: (8,2) is directly left-down from (9,1)?

Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first determine if there's dirt to clean.

No dirt is mentioned at my current position. Therefore, I cannot clean anything. Also, no apple is indicated at (8,2). 

Since I can't eat an apple (no apple present) and can't clean dirt (no dirt), the best action is to **stay** and assess the situation.

However, since I’m at (6,5) and nothing is visible, it's possible I’m on clean land or on dirt. Without confirmation, I cannot eat an apple (no apple visible). 

**Action: stay**  
Reason: No visible items or dirt to clean, and no apples to eat. Staying allows me to assess the environment before taking action.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,2). Dirt at (6,3), (8,3).
  Thinking: At (8,2), you are not on any dirt, so you can't clean. There's no apple visible at your position.  

Dirt is at (6,3) and (8,3). To clean dirt, you must be on the same cell. You are at (8,2), so you can't clean (8,3) directly unless you move there.  

To access (8,3), move **right** to (8,3) — then you can clean it. Cleaning dirt doesn’t give points, but it helps make the river cleaner, which may eventually allow apples to spawn.  

Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — so cleaning dirt is a prerequisite.  

**Best action: move right to (8,3)** to clean dirt.  

→ **Action: right**
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Dirt at (7,4).
  Thinking: At (7,5), there is dirt at (7,4), directly below you. Since you can only clean dirt when you are on the same cell, you cannot clean (7,4) from (7,5). 

To clean the dirt at (7,4), you must move to (7,4) first. Then, you can clean it. Cleaning dirt doesn't give points, but it makes the river cleaner, which increases the chance of apples spawning — and thus enables you to eat apples for +1.0 points each.

**Action: move down to (7,4)**  
Then: clean (7,4)  
After that, if apples spawn (which depends on overall river cleanliness), you can eat them.

**Reasoning:** Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning. Without cleaning, no apples can appear. Since you're not on the dirt cell, you must move there first.  

✅ Move down → clean → (if apples appear later) eat.
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first determine whether there's dirt to clean.

However, with no visible items, it's likely that either:
- You are on clean land (no dirt to clean), or
- Dirt is present but not visible (possibly in adjacent cells).

Since apples require a clean river (less dirt), and cleaning dirt gives no points but enables apple spawning, the optimal strategy is to **check your surroundings** to find dirt.

But you can't see anything. So, the best first step is to **move** to a neighboring cell to investigate.

**Action: right** (to (8,0)) — to explore and potentially find dirt or apples.

Reasoning: Without visibility, you can't confirm if dirt exists or if apples are present. Moving allows you to gather more information before cleaning or eating.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (9,2). Dirt at (8,3).
  Thinking: You are at (9,2). Dirt is at (8,3).  

To clean dirt, you must be on the same cell as the dirt. You are not on (8,3), so you cannot clean it directly.  

To reach (8,3), you must move:  
- Left from (9,2) to (8,2), then  
- Down to (8,3).  

But cleaning dirt gives no points — it only enables apple spawning. Apples spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned).  

Currently, there's no apple visible, and you can't eat anything unless an apple is present on your cell. Since there's no apple at (9,2), and no indication of apple spawning, you cannot eat.  

**Best action: Move left to (8,2), then down to (8,3) to clean the dirt.**  

This will make the river cleaner, potentially enabling apples to spawn elsewhere (though not directly on your current cell).

Action: **clean**  
Reason: You can only gain apples when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is removed). Since you're on a cell with dirt, cleaning it is necessary to enable apple spawning. Cleaning gives no points directly, but it's required to unlock future apple spawns.  

After cleaning (7,4), the dirt is gone. Now, the river is cleaner, and apples may spawn on land (if conditions allow).  

Next step: Monitor for apple spawns — but currently, no apples are visible.  

**Action: clean** ✅

Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first check if there's dirt to clean. Without visibility, you can't confirm the state of the surroundings.

Action: **stay**  
Reasoning: You cannot clean or eat anything without knowing if dirt or apples are present. Staying allows you to assess the environment. If you move, you might miss critical information. Wait for visibility or a detectable item before acting.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,2). Dirt at (6,3), (8,3).
  Thinking: At (8,2), I see dirt at (6,3) and (8,3). I am not on any dirt, so I cannot clean it yet. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned to allow apple spawning. Since I'm not on dirt, I can't clean it directly.

To clean dirt, I must move to a cell with dirt. The closest dirt is at (8,3) — directly below me. I can move down to (8,3), clean it, then evaluate next steps.

**Action: down** → move to (8,3)  
**Then: clean** → remove dirt at (8,3)

Now, after cleaning (8,3), the river is cleaner in that area. But apples only spawn *on land* when the river is clean — and since (8,3) was adjacent to me, cleaning it may now allow apple spawning *on land cells near it*. However, I need to check if any apple has spawned — but no apple is mentioned.

Currently, no apples are visible, and I can't eat one unless one is present. So, I must continue cleaning to enable apple spawning.

**Next step: stay** (
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,4). Dirt at (6,3), (8,3).
  Thinking: At (7,4), you are not on any dirt, so you cannot clean. There are no apples visible at your position.  

Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. Currently, dirt is at (6,3) and (8,3), which are not adjacent to you.  

To maximize points:  
- You must **move to a dirt cell** to clean it.  
- Cleaning dirt gives no points, but enables apple spawning on land (which is necessary to eat apples).  

Best action: **move left to (6,4)** or **move right to (8,4)** — both are adjacent to dirt cells.  

But (6,3) and (8,3) are directly below (6,4) and (8,4), so moving to (6,4) or (8,4) allows you to clean the dirt at (6,3) or (8,3) from adjacent cells? No — you can only clean dirt **on your current cell**.  

So you **cannot clean (6,3) or (8,3)** from (7,4) because you are not on those cells.  

Therefore, you must **
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first check if there's dirt to clean.  

However, since nothing is visible, you cannot confirm if dirt is present. Without dirt, there are no apples to eat.  

**Action: stay**  
Reason: You cannot clean or eat without knowing what’s in your cell. Staying allows you to assess the situation. If dirt is present, you can clean it later. If not, no apples will spawn. Safety and information gathering are key.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Agent 2 at (7,3).
  Thinking: At (7,2), I am not on a dirt cell, and there's no visible apple. Agent 2 is at (7,3), which is directly above me. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I need to assess whether there's dirt to clean nearby.

Currently, I am at (7,2). If (7,2) is land and not dirt, I can eat an apple if one is present. But since no apple is mentioned and no dirt is indicated, I assume there's no apple here. If there's dirt, I could clean it—but only if I'm on a dirt cell.

No action is possible without knowing the terrain (dirt/land) at (7,2) or nearby. Since I'm not on dirt, I can't clean. And no apple is visible.

Best action: **stay** — to monitor the situation and possibly wait for an apple to spawn when the river (area) becomes clean.  

→ **Stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,3). Agent 1 at (7,2).
  Thinking: At (7,3), I am not on an apple or dirt. Agent 1 is at (7,2), which is directly above me.  

There’s no indication of dirt or apples at my current position. Since I can only eat apples or clean dirt when on a cell, and there's no apple visible, I should first check if there’s dirt to clean to enable apple spawning.  

However, no dirt is mentioned, and apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. Without knowing the state of the terrain or dirt around me, I cannot assume there’s dirt to clean.  

Best action: **stay** — to assess the environment and possibly wait for an opportunity to clean dirt or find an apple.  

**Reasoning**: No apples or dirt are visible at (7,3). Moving without purpose risks missing a cleanable cell or apple. Staying allows observation and better decision-making.

Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,0). Dirt at (7,0).
  Thinking: At (5,0), you are not on dirt, so you cannot clean it. Dirt is at (7,0), which is to your right. To clean dirt, you must move to (7,0) first.  

**Action: right**  
→ Move to (7,0) to clean the dirt.  

After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner, which may enable apples to spawn (though apples only spawn on land when the river is clean). However, cleaning itself gives no points.  

Once the river is clean, if apples appear on land, you can then move to eat them.  

**Next step: After cleaning, check if apples spawn (if any), then move to eat them.**  

But currently, no apples are mentioned.  

**Final reasoning**: Move right to (7,0) to clean dirt. This is necessary to enable apple spawning. Then, monitor for apples.

  Obs: You at (7,2). Agent 2 at (7,3).
  Thinking: At (7,2), I am not on a dirt cell, and there's no apple visible. Agent 2 is at (7,3), which is above me. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points, I must first determine if there's dirt to clean nearby.

Currently, I’m at (7,2). If there's dirt in my cell or adjacent cells, I could clean it. But since no dirt or apple is mentioned, and I have no information about the environment, I should assume the current state is neutral.

However, to enable apples to spawn, dirt must be cleaned. Since I can only act on my current cell, I should:

→ **Check if (7,2) has dirt.** If yes, clean it.  
→ If not, I can't spawn apples, so I need to move to a dirt cell to clean it.

But no info about dirt is given. So, safest action: **stay** — to assess the situation further.  

**Reasoning:** Without confirmation of dirt or apple presence, and since eating gives +1.0 per apple, I cannot eat safely. Cleaning dirt gives no points, so I

Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points, I must first assess whether there's dirt at my current position. There's no info about dirt at (7,3).  

No apple is visible, so I cannot eat.  

Best action: **stay** — to monitor the situation. If dirt appears or if I can get closer to a dirt cell, I can clean. But without more info, no action leads to points.

You cannot clean dirt unless you are on the same cell. So, you must move to (7,0) to clean it.  

After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn (though apples only spawn on land when the river is clean). However, cleaning dirt gives no points.  

Currently, there's no apple visible, and you're not on a cell with an apple.  

Best action: **move right** to (7,0) to clean the dirt.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Agent 2 at (7,3).
  Thinking: At (7,2), I am not on a dirt cell, and there's no apple visible. Agent 2 is at (7,3), which is directly above me. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and I have no dirt to clean at (7,2), I cannot spawn apples here.

I must first check if there's dirt to clean at my current position. If not, I should move to a location where dirt exists to clean and eventually enable apple spawning.

However, based on current info:  
- No dirt indicated at (7,2)  
- No apple at (7,2)  
- Agent 2 is at (7,3), possibly in a position with dirt or apple  

**Action: stay** — unless there's dirt to clean or apple to eat. Since no apple or dirt is mentioned, and I’m not in a position to clean or eat, staying is safe.

But wait — the rule says apples only spawn *when the river is clean*. So if dirt is present, I must clean it. But I don’t know if (7,2) has dirt.

Since no dirt or apple is visible, and I’m at (7

  Obs: You at (7,3). Agent 1 at (7,2).
  Thinking: At (7,3), there's no apple visible, and no dirt is mentioned. Agent 1 is at (7,2), which is directly above you. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points, we must first assess whether we can clean dirt to enable apple spawning.

However, we have no information about dirt at (7,3) or nearby. Since we can only clean dirt *at our position*, and there's no indication of dirt here, we cannot clean anything.

Therefore, we **cannot eat** an apple (no apple present), and we **cannot clean** dirt (no dirt to clean).

Best action: **stay** — to monitor the situation, possibly wait for apple spawning if dirt is cleaned elsewhere or if future updates indicate dirt at (7,3).

**Action: stay**.

Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Dirt at (7,0).
  Thinking: At (7,0), there is dirt. Since you can only clean dirt when you're on a cell with dirt, you should **clean** the dirt.  

Cleaning dirt gives no points directly, but it's necessary to enable apple spawning on land. Once the river is clean (i.e., less dirt), apples may spawn, allowing you to eat them and gain points.  

**Action: clean** ✅  
But I can only clean if I'm on a dirt
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (7,2), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (8,1), you are not on any dirt, so you cannot clean. There's no apple visible at your current position.  

Dirt is at (7,2) and (6,0) — both not adjacent to you. To eat apples, the river must be clean (i.e., dirt must be cleaned), which requires being on a dirt cell.  

**Action:** Move to a dirt cell to clean it.  

Best move: **left** to (7,1), then possibly down or up to reach (7,2) or (6,0). But (7,2) is directly right-up from (7,1).  

**Immediate action:** **left** to (7,1) — closer to (7,2).  

Then from there, move to (7,2) to clean it. After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn.  

**Next step after cleaning:** Check if apples spawn (though not visible now).  

But since apples only spawn when river is clean, and cleaning gives no points, the goal is to enable apple spawning.  

**Final reasoning:** You must move to clean dirt to enable apple spawning.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Dirt at (7,6), (7,4).
  Thinking: At (7,5), you are on a clean cell (no dirt). Dirt is at (7,6) and (7,4), both adjacent.  

- You cannot eat an apple yet because there are no apples spawning—apples only spawn when the river is clean, which depends on dirt being cleaned.  
- You must clean dirt to make the river clean and enable apple spawning.  
- You can only clean dirt if you are on the same cell as it.  

So, to clean dirt at (7,6) or (7,4), you must move there first.  

Best action: **move left to (7,4)** to clean that dirt.  

After cleaning (7,4), the river becomes cleaner (less dirt), which may enable apple spawning. Then you can move to (7,5) again and potentially eat an apple if one has appeared.  

✅ Reasoning: Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apples. You must move to a dirt cell to clean it.

Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,7). Dirt at (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (7,6).
  Thinking: At (7,7), I can see dirt at (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), and (7,6). Since I can only clean dirt or eat apples **at my current position**, and there's no apple at (7,7), I cannot eat yet.

To spawn apples, the river must be clean — meaning there must be no dirt. But apples only spawn *on land* when the river is clean. Since I'm not on any of the dirt cells, I can't clean them directly.

However, to clean dirt, I must **move to a dirt cell** and then use the "clean" action.

Current dirt cells:
- (6,8): above-left
- (7,8): above
- (8,8): right-up
- (7,6): below

I am at (7,7). I can move to (7,8) or (7,6) to clean dirt there.

But cleaning dirt gives **no points**, only enables apple spawning later.

So, reasoning:
- I cannot eat an apple now — no apple at (7,7).
- I must move to a dirt cell to clean it.
- Cleaning dirt is necessary to eventually enable

Dirt is at (7,2) and (6,0) — both are not adjacent to you. To clean dirt, you must be on the same cell as the dirt.  

Since you can't clean dirt at your current position, and there are no apples at (7,1), you cannot eat.  

**Best action: move to (7,2)** to clean the dirt there.  

**Reasoning:** Cleaning dirt enables apple spawning on land, which increases apple availability. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt), cleaning is essential to gain future apple opportunities.

  Obs: You at (6,5). Dirt at (7,6), (7,4).
  Thinking: At (6,5), you are not on any dirt, so you cannot clean. There are no apples visible at your position.  

Dirt is at (7,6) and (7,4) — both are outside your current position, so you must move there to clean.  

But: **Cleaning dirt gives no points**, only enables apple spawning on land when the river is clean.  

Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — so cleaning the dirt at (7,6) and (7,4) would eventually allow apples to appear on land.  

However, **you can only eat apples when you are on a cell with one**, and you currently don't have one.  

**Best action:** Move to (7,6) to clean it (no points, but progress).  

After cleaning, you might be able to move to (7,4) and clean it too. Then, if apples spawn on land (which they do when river is clean), you can eat them when you reach those cells.  

But right now — **no apples, no cleanable dirt at (6,5)**.

Currently, I am at (8,7). The closest dirt is at (8,8) — directly above me. I can move to (8,8) to clean it. After cleaning (8,8), that cell becomes clean, and possibly enables apple spawning if it's on land. But apples only spawn *on land* when the river is clean — I need to assess if any of the dirt cells are adjacent to land where apples could spawn.

Since apples spawn on land when clean, and I can only eat apples when I’m on a cell with an apple, I should first clean dirt to make land available.

**Action plan:**
1. Move to (8,8) — adjacent to dirt.
2. Clean (8,8).

Dirt is at (7,2) and (6,0) — both are not adjacent to you, so you can't clean them directly.  

Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and you can't clean dirt unless you're on it, you must first move to a dirt cell to clean it.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Dirt at (7,6), (8,6), (7,4).
  Thinking: At (7,5), you see dirt at (7,6), (8,6), and (7,4). You are not on any dirt, so you cannot clean right now.  

Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. Since you are at (7,5), you can only clean dirt if you are on the same cell as it.  

- (7,6) is directly above you → you can go up to (7,6) and clean it.  
- (8,6) is to the right of (7,6) → you’d need to go to (8,6) to clean it.  
- (7,4) is directly below you → you can go down to (7,4) and clean it.  

So, possible moves:  
- Go up to (7,6) → clean dirt (no points, but enables apple spawning later)  
- Go down to (7,4) → clean dirt (no points, but enables apple spawning)  
- Go right to (8,6) → then clean it (requires movement)  

No apples are currently spawning because there's still dirt.  

Reason: I need to assess the environment first. Staying allows me to gather more information (e.g., if dirt appears or if apples spawn later). Moving without knowing the surroundings could lead to missing opportunities or unnecessary actions. I cannot eat or clean without knowing what's at my current position.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (6,0). Agent 1 at (8,2).
  Thinking: At (8,1), there is no apple currently. The dirt is at (6,0), which is not adjacent to your position, so you cannot clean it directly. You cannot eat an apple because none is present at your location. 

To enable apple spawning, the river must be clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. Since you're not adjacent to the dirt at (6,0), you must first move to a position adjacent to it to clean it.

Best action: **move left to (7,1)**, then to (6,1), then to (6,0) to clean the dirt. After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner, which increases the chance of apples spawning on land. Then, you can move to a land cell with an apple to eat it and gain points.

But currently, no apple is available.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,2). Agent 3 at (7,1).
  Thinking: At (8,2), I am on land. I need to assess whether there's an apple to eat or if I need to clean dirt first.

- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt).  
- Cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary to enable apple spawning.  
- I can only act on my current cell.

Since I'm at (8,2), and there's no information about dirt or apples at this location, I cannot assume there's an apple. Without confirmation of dirt presence or apple spawn, I cannot safely eat.

**Action: stay**  
→ Reason: I don't know if there's dirt or an apple at (8,2). I need to observe or clean if dirt is present. Staying allows me to assess the situation before acting.  

(If dirt were present, I’d clean it first to enable apple spawning. But with no info, safest move is to stay.)
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,5). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,5), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apples to spawn, you must first clean dirt. However, without knowing if there's dirt at your current position, you can't act.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: You need to assess your surroundings first. Staying allows you to observe or detect dirt/apples in your immediate cell. If there's dirt, you can clean it to enable apple spawning. If there's nothing, you may need to explore. Since nothing is visible, staying is safe and necessary to gather more information.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Dirt at (6,0). Agent 1 at (8,2).
  Thinking: At (7,1), there is dirt at (6,0), which is not adjacent to you. You cannot clean it directly. There's no apple visible at your position, so you can't eat one yet.

To enable apples to spawn, the river must be clean — but since dirt is only at (6,0), and you're at (7,1), you need to move to that cell to clean it.

**Best action: move left to (6,1)** — closer to (6,0), possibly to clean it later.

But wait — you can only clean dirt **on your current cell**. So unless (6,1) has dirt, you can't clean it there.

Currently, dirt is at (6,0), not (6,1). So you are not on dirt.

Thus, **you cannot clean anything now**, and **no apple is available**.

**Best action: stay** — no immediate benefit, and no cleanable dirt at your position.

Wait — but apples only spawn when the river is clean. Since the river isn't clean (dirt exists), apples aren't spawning.

So to get apples, you must clean dirt.

But you're not on dirt. You need to move to

--- Step 16 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,2). Dirt at (7,3). Agent 3 at (6,1).
  Thinking: At (8,2), there is dirt at (7,3), which is not directly adjacent. Since you can only clean dirt if you are on the same cell, you cannot clean (7,3) from (8,2).  

There is no apple mentioned, so no apple can be eaten.  

Agent 3 is at (6,1), but agents do not affect your actions or points.  

**Best action:** Move to a position where you can reach the dirt at (7,3) to clean it. The closest path is to move left to (7,2), then down to (7,3).  

**Action: left** → move to (7,2)  

(Now at (7,2), you can eventually clean (7,3) if you move to it.)  

**Reasoning:** Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning, and apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Since apples are not currently present, and cleaning is required to enable them, the priority is to clean dirt. Moving left to (7,2) is the first step.  

**Next step:** From (7,2), move down to (7,3) to clean.  

**Final decision:
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,5). Dirt at (7,6).
  Thinking: You are at (6,5). Dirt is at (7,6).  

To clean dirt, you must be on the same cell as the dirt. You are not on (7,6), so you cannot clean it directly.  

Possible actions:  
- Move to (7,6) to clean the dirt.  
- Otherwise, you cannot clean or eat anything.  

**Reasoning**: Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and you can't eat or clean dirt unless you're on it, you must move to (7,6) first.  

✅ Best action: **right** (to go from (6,5) to (7,5)), then **down** (to (7,6)) → then **clean**.  

After cleaning, if the river is clean, apples may spawn (but only on land). Since no land or apple info is given, we assume apples may appear later.  

**Next step**: Move to (7,6) and clean.  

→ Action: **right**, then **down**, then **clean**.  

But since the question asks for reasoning in short:  

**Short reasoning**: You are not on the dirt at (7,
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,1). Dirt at (6,0). Agent 1 at (8,2).
  Thinking: At (6,1), there is dirt at (6,0) directly below you. You can **clean** the dirt at (6,0) since you're on (6,1) and can only act on items in your current cell or adjacent ones — but cleaning dirt requires being on the cell with dirt.

However, you are **not on (6,0)**, so you cannot clean it directly. You must **move down to (6,0)** to clean it.

**Action: down** → move to (6,0)  
Now you are on the dirt cell.  
**Action: clean** → clean the dirt at (6,0)

This action helps make the river cleaner (improves apple spawning conditions), even though cleaning gives no points. After cleaning, if the river becomes clean, apples may spawn on land nearby — but currently, no apples are visible.

No apples are present, and no other land cells are indicated.

**Conclusion**: Move down to (6,0), then clean. This advances the state toward enabling apple spawning.  
**Next step: stay and monitor for apple spawn** (if any).  

No point gained yet, but necessary for future apple spawning.  

**Final action: down

--- Step 17 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Dirt at (7,3).
  Thinking: At (7,2), there is no apple visible, and the only item nearby is dirt at (7,3), which is directly below you. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when there's no dirt), and dirt at (7,3) is not currently cleaned, we cannot spawn apples yet.

Action: **clean** (to remove dirt at (7,3))  
→ This will clean the dirt, making the area cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn later.  

After cleaning, the river will be cleaner, potentially enabling apple spawning in the future. But since we cannot eat yet (no apple on current cell), we must first clean the dirt.

**Reasoning**: Cleaning is necessary to enable apple spawning. Without cleaning dirt, apples won't appear. We must act now to progress toward earning points.

(Reason: Cleaning is required to enable apple spawning; no points now, but essential for future gains.)

--- Step 27 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Agent 2 at (7,3).
  Thinking: At (7,2), I am not on a dirt cell, and there's no apple visible. Agent 2 is at (7,3), which is directly above me. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and I currently have no dirt to clean, I cannot spawn apples.

Action: **stay**  
Reason: I need to assess the environment. If there's dirt nearby, I should clean it to enable apple spawning. Since I'm at (7,2) and no dirt is visible, and I can't eat an apple without one, staying allows me to monitor the situation. I may need to move to a dirt cell to clean it. But with no dirt or apple visible, **stay** is safest.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,3). Agent 1 at (7,2).
  Thinking: At (7,3), I am not on an apple. Agent 1 is at (7,2), so there's no immediate apple nearby. To spawn apples, the river must be clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. Since I'm currently on land at (7,3), I can choose to clean dirt if present, but cleaning gives no points.  

I should first check if there's dirt at (7,3). If yes, I can clean it to potentially enable apple spawning. If no dirt, then apples may already be present.  

But since I'm not on an apple and no apple is mentioned, I assume there's no apple at (7,3) yet.  

**Action: clean** (if dirt is present) — to improve conditions for apple spawning.  

**Reasoning:** Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning, even though it gives no points. Without cleaning, apples won’t appear. I must first ensure the environment is clean before eating.  

→ **Action: clean**
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apple spawning, you must first clean dirt. However, without knowing if there's dirt nearby, you can't act.

Best first step: **Move to a cell where dirt might be present** (e.g., check adjacent cells). But since nothing is visible, you must explore.

Action: **right** → move to (8,0) to investigate.  

Reasoning: Without visibility, you can't eat or clean. Exploration is needed to find dirt to clean, which is required to spawn apples. Moving right is a safe first step to gather more information.

--- Step 28 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Dirt at (8,1). Agent 2 at (7,3).
  Thinking: At (7,2), there is no apple present. The only dirt is at (8,1), which is not adjacent to your position. You cannot clean dirt at (8,1) unless you move there. Since you're currently at (7,2), you can't clean that dirt or eat an apple.

Available actions:
- Move to adjacent cells (up, down, left, right) to get closer to dirt or possibly spawn apples.
- Clean only if on a dirt cell.
- Eat only if on an apple.

Right now, no apple is available, and you can't clean dirt from your current position.

**Best action: move down to (8,2)** — this brings you closer to the dirt at (8,1), enabling future cleaning. Cleaning dirt will help make the river cleaner, which may eventually lead to apple spawning.

**Reasoning:** Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning, but it doesn't give points. However, without cleaning, apples won’t spawn. Moving toward the dirt is the logical first step.  

→ **Action: down**
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,3). Dirt at (7,4). Agent 1 at (7,2).
  Thinking: At (7,3), there is dirt at (7,4), which is directly to the right. Agent 1 is at (7,2), above you.  

Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first clean the dirt at (7,4) to enable potential apple spawning.  

However, I am currently at (7,3), and the dirt is at (7,4) — I need to move right to (7,4) to clean it.  

**Action: right**  
→ Move to (7,4) and clean the dirt.  

Now, the river is cleaner at that point, and apples may spawn on adjacent land cells (if any). But since no apples are mentioned, and I don’t have any apple at my current location, I cannot eat one yet.  

After cleaning, I can consider whether to return or move to check for apples. But with no apples visible, and no other information, the best immediate step is to clean the dirt.  

✅ **Action: right** (to clean dirt at (7,4))
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Dirt at (8,1).
  Thinking: At (8,0), there is dirt at (8,1), which is directly above you. Since you can only clean dirt when you are on the same cell as the dirt, you cannot clean it from (8,0).  

To clean the dirt at (8,1), you must move to (8,1) first.  

**Action: move down** — No, that would take you away from the dirt.  
**Action: move up** — That would take you to (7,0), which is not helpful.  
**Action: move left/right** — No dirt there.  
**Action: move to (8,1)** — Only possible via "up" from (8,0)? Wait — (8,1) is directly above (8,0), so **up** takes you to (8,1).  

✅ **Best action: up** → move to (8,1)  

Now you are on the dirt cell. You can **clean** it.  

**Action: clean** → removes dirt (now river is cleaner, which may enable apples to spawn)  

After cleaning, the river is cleaner → apples may now spawn on land. But since apples only spawn *on land* when

--- Step 29 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Dirt at (8,1). Agent 3 at (8,1).
  Thinking: You are at (7,1). There is dirt at (8,1), and Agent 3 is also at (8,1).  

You cannot clean dirt or eat apples unless you are on the same cell as the dirt. Since you are at (7,1) and the dirt is at (8,1), you must move to (8,1) to clean it. However, Agent 3 is already there — if agents can't share cells or if movement is blocked, you may not be able to access it.

**Assumption**: Only one agent can occupy a cell at a time. Since Agent 3 is at (8,1), you cannot move there.

→ You cannot clean dirt or eat apples.  
→ No apples can spawn because the river is not clean (dirt remains uncleaned).  

**Action**: stay  
→ No gain, no progress.  

**Reasoning**: You are blocked from cleaning dirt due to Agent 3's presence. No apples can spawn, and you cannot act. Best move is to stay.  

**Final action: stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,3). Dirt at (7,4).
  Thinking: At (8,3), you are not on dirt, so you cannot clean it directly. Dirt is at (7,4), which is not adjacent to your current position. To clean dirt, you must move to a cell with dirt to perform the "clean" action.

Currently, you cannot eat an apple because there's no apple indicated, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned). Since dirt is at (7,4), you need to move to (7,4) to clean it.

**Action: move left to (7,3)**  
(Not directly at (7,4), but closer. From (7,3), you can then move up/down/right to reach (7,4).)

But better: **move up to (7,3)** → then **left to (7,2)** → then **down to (8,2)** → not efficient.

Wait: (8,3) to (7,4) is diagonally adjacent — you can only move up/down/left/right. So from (8,3), to reach (7,4), you must go:

- (8,3) → (7,3) → (7,4)

--- Step 1 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,5). Dirt at (7,6), (7,4).
  Thinking: At (5,5), I am not on any dirt, so I cannot clean yet. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — currently, dirt is at (7,6) and (7,4), so the river is not clean. To enable apple spawning, I must clean the dirt.

I need to move to one of the dirt cells to clean them. The closest dirt is at (7,6) and (7,4). Moving to (7,6) requires going down 2 and right 1 → (7,6). From there, I can clean it.

After cleaning (7,6), I can move to (7,4) and clean that too — but cleaning gives no points. Only eating apples gives points.

So, plan:
- Move to (7,6) → clean → now river is cleaner (one dirt removed)
- Move to (7,4) → clean → river fully clean
- Now, apples may spawn on land — but I need to be on land where apples appear

But currently, no apples are mentioned to have spawned. Apples only spawn *when the river is clean*, so after both dirt cells are cleaned, apples can appear on land.

But I don
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (9,7). Dirt at (7,8), (7,6).
  Thinking: At (9,7), you are not on any dirt, so you can't clean yet. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — currently, dirt is at (7,8) and (7,6), which are not near you. Since you're not on dirt, you can't clean it directly.  

To enable apple spawning, you must move to a dirt cell and clean it. The closest dirt is at (7,8) and (7,6). Moving to (7,8) or (7,6) would allow you to clean it, which improves the river's cleanliness and may enable apples to spawn on land.  

Best action: **move left to (8,7)**, then continue to (7,7) or (7,8) to reach dirt.  

But right now, you can only act on your current cell. You are not on dirt, so you can't clean. You also can't eat (no apple at (9,7)).  

**Action: left** (to get closer to dirt at (7,8))  

→ Reason: You must reach dirt to clean it, which enables apple spawning. Moving left is the most direct path to (7,8).
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (9,0). Dirt at (8,1), (8,0).
  Thinking: At (9,0), you are on land. There is dirt at (8,1) and (8,0), but you can only clean dirt if you are on the same cell. Since you are at (9,0), you are not on (8,0) or (8,1), so you **cannot clean** dirt directly.

There are no apples mentioned, so no apples are currently available to eat.

**Best action: stay**  
Reason: You can't clean dirt or eat apples from your current position. Staying allows you to monitor the situation. If the river becomes clean (dirt is removed), apples may spawn. But since you can't clean dirt from here, and no apples are present, no immediate action gains points.

→ **Action: stay**

--- Step 2 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,4). Dirt at (7,4).
  Thinking: You are at (5,4). Dirt is at (7,4), which is to your right.  

To eat apples, the river must be clean (i.e., no dirt). Since dirt is at (7,4), you need to clean it to make apples spawn.  

Action: **right** to move to (7,4), then **clean** the dirt.  

After cleaning, the river is cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn (though no apples are visible yet). Then you can return to (5,4) or move around to find apples.  

**Next step: right → clean**.  

This is necessary to enable apple spawning. Cleaning gives no points, but it's essential.
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,7). Dirt at (6,8), (7,8), (7,6).
  Thinking: At (8,7), you are not on any dirt cells. Dirt is at (6,8), (7,8), (7,6) — all of which are not adjacent to your current position.  

To eat an apple, the river must be clean (i.e., dirt must be removed), and apples only spawn *on land* when the river is clean. Since you're not on dirt, you can't clean it directly.  

Current options:  
- **Move** to a neighboring cell to potentially reach dirt.  
- **Stay** — no dirt to clean, no apple to eat.  

Best action: **move left to (7,7)** — this is adjacent to (7,6), where there's dirt. From there, you can clean (7,6) if you reach it.  

But you must first get to a dirt cell to clean it.  

So:  
✅ **Move left to (7,7)** → now adjacent to (7,6)  
Then: **move down to (7,6)** → clean dirt (no points, but necessary)  
Then: possibly move to (7,8) or (6,8) to clean more.  

After cleaning, the river
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (9,0). Dirt at (8,1), (8,0).
  Thinking: At (9,0), you are adjacent to dirt at (8,0) and (8,1). Since you can only clean dirt when on your current cell, and there's no dirt at (9,0), you cannot clean dirt directly here.

However, to spawn apples, the river must be clean — which depends on dirt being cleaned. Since dirt is at (8,0) and (8,1), you need to move to one of those cells to clean them.

But you can only clean dirt **on your current cell**. So:

- You are at (9,0) → no dirt here → cannot clean.
- To clean (8,0), you must move to (8,0).
- To clean (8,1), you must move to (8,1).

So, best action: **move left to (8,0)**.

Once there, you can clean the dirt at (8,0), which helps make the river cleaner and enables apple spawning (though apples don’t spawn immediately — they require the river to be clean, which depends on dirt being cleaned).

After cleaning, you may then move to (8,1) to clean that too, or stay and wait for apples to spawn.

**Best immediate action:** Clean
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (9,7). Dirt at (7,8), (8,8), (7,6), (8,6). Apple at (11,7).
  Thinking: At (9,7), you are not on any dirt, so you can't clean yet. There's an apple at (11,7), but you're at (9,7) — you need to move right to (10,7) then to (11,7) to eat it. However, apples only spawn when the river is clean — currently, there's dirt at (7,8), (8,8), (7,6), (8,6), which are far from your position. Since you can't clean dirt unless you're on it, and you're not on any of those dirt cells, the river is still dirty, so **no apples can spawn**.

Therefore, you **cannot eat the apple at (11,7)** because it’s not spawning due to the dirty river.

**Best action: stay** — you can't clean dirt from your current position, and there's no apple available to eat. Moving would not help since apples don't spawn yet.

✅ Reasoning: Apples require clean river (dirt cleaned), but dirt is not reachable from (9,7). No apple can be eaten now. Cleaning is not possible. Stay.  

**Action: stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Dirt at (7,2), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (7,1), you can see dirt at (7,2) and (6,0).  

- You cannot eat an apple yet because there are no apples visible — apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned).  
- You can **clean** dirt only if you are on the same cell as the dirt.  
- You are at (7,1), so you can **clean (7,2)** if you move there.  
- (6,0) is not adjacent, so you must move there first (e.g., up to (6,1), then left to (6,0)) — but that takes steps and may not be optimal.  

**Best action: Move to (7,2) to clean dirt.**  
After cleaning (7,2), the river becomes cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn — increasing chances for future apple eating.  

**Action: right** (to move to (7,2)) → then clean.  

→ Final action: **right, then clean**.  

(Reasoning: Cleaning dirt enables apple spawning; eating apples gives points, but only if apples are present. Cleaning is necessary first.)

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Dirt at (7,6), (8,6), (7,4).
  Thinking: At (7,5), you can see dirt at (7,6), (8,6), and (7,4). Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when there's no dirt), and you can only clean dirt *at your position*, you must first move to a dirt cell to clean it.

Currently, you're at (7,5), which is not on any dirt cell. The nearest dirt cells are:
- (7,6): directly above you
- (7,4): directly below you
- (8,6): to the right

You can:
- Move to (7,6) → clean it → removes dirt, possibly enabling apple spawning
- Move to (7,4) → clean it → removes dirt
- Move to (8,6) → clean it

But note: cleaning dirt gives no points, only enables apple spawning. So the goal is to clean dirt to create land for apples, then eat them.

Since you're at (7,5), moving **up to (7,6)** is the closest dirt cell. Cleaning (7,6) will remove dirt and potentially allow an apple to spawn *on (7,6)* — but only
  Decision: 'up' -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (9,7). Dirt at (7,8), (8,8), (7,6), (8,6). Apple at (11,7).
  Thinking: You are at (9,7).  
Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned to allow apples to appear.  
Currently, there is dirt at (7,8), (8,8), (7,6), (8,6).  
The apple is at (11,7), which is not adjacent to you and is not on land unless the river (implied to be near those coordinates) is clean.

You can only clean dirt or eat apples **at your current position**.

Right now, you are at (9,7), which is **not on any dirt cell**.  
There is no dirt at (9,7), so you can’t clean anything here.  
There’s an apple at (11,7), which is not at your position, so you can’t eat it yet.

**Action:** Stay.  
Why? Because you cannot clean dirt or eat an apple from your current position.  
To get apples, you must first clean dirt (which requires being on a dirt cell).  
You are not on any dirt, so you need to move to a dirt cell to clean it — which will make the land cleaner and possibly allow apples to spawn.

Best next step
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (7,2), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (8,1), you are not on any dirt, so you can't clean. There's no apple visible at your current position.  

Dirt is at (7,2) and (6,0) — both are not adjacent to you. To access them, you’d need to move toward those cells.  

But: **Apples only spawn when the river is clean**, meaning dirt must be cleaned. Since you can only clean dirt *on your current cell*, and you’re not on any dirt cells, you cannot clean anything yet.  

Therefore:  
- You cannot eat an apple (none are present at (8,1)).  
- You cannot clean dirt (you're not on it).  

**Best action: move toward dirt to clean it.**  

Move left to (7,1) — closer to (7,2). Then eventually reach (7,2) to clean it.  

**Action: left**  

(Reasoning: Cleaning dirt is necessary to spawn apples. Without cleaning, no apples appear. Moving toward dirt enables future cleaning and apple spawning.)

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,6). Dirt at (7,6), (8,6). Agent 2 at (8,7).
  Thinking: At (7,6), there is dirt, so I can clean it. Cleaning dirt doesn't give points, but it's necessary to enable apples to spawn later. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), cleaning (7,6) will help create conditions for apples to appear.

Currently, there's also dirt at (8,6), which I cannot reach directly without moving. I am at (7,6), so I can move to (8,6) to clean it, but that would require movement.

However, I must consider: can I eat an apple now? No — there's no apple at (7,6) or (8,6); only dirt. So eating is not possible.

Best action: **clean** at (7,6) to begin cleaning the river and enable future apple spawning.

**Action: clean**.
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,7). Dirt at (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (7,6), (8,6). Agent 1 at (7,6).
  Thinking: You are at (8,7).  
Dirt is at: (6,8), (7,8), (8,8), (7,6), (8,6).  
Agent 1 is at (7,6) — that’s a dirt cell.

**Current situation:**
- You are at (8,7), which is **not** a dirt cell.
- The only dirt cells nearby are (7,6), (8,6), (7,8), (8,8), (6,8).
- Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and you can only clean dirt **on your current cell**, you cannot clean dirt at (7,6) or others unless you move there.

**Can you eat an apple?**  
No apples are mentioned to be present. Apples only spawn *after* dirt is cleaned. Since no dirt is at your current position (8,7), you can't eat an apple.

**Best action:**  
Move to a dirt cell so you can clean it.  
The closest dirt cells are:
- (8,6) — directly below you (down)
- (7,6) — left and down
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Dirt at (7,2), (6,0), (8,0).
  Thinking: At (7,1), you are not on any dirt, so you cannot clean. There is no apple at your position.  

Dirt is at (7,2), (6,0), (8,0) — none of these are adjacent to (7,1) except (7,2), which is directly above.  

So, to get apples, you must first clean dirt to make the river clean (which enables apple spawning).  

**Action: move up to (7,2)** — this is where dirt is located.  

**Reasoning:** Cleaning dirt is required to enable apples to spawn. Since apples only appear when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt), I must clean dirt first. (7,2) is the only adjacent dirt cell. Cleaning it will reduce dirt and potentially allow apples to spawn later.  

✅ Action: **clean**
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Dirt at (7,6).
  Thinking: At (7,5), there is no apple visible. Dirt is at (7,6), which is directly above you. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and you can only clean dirt at your current position, you cannot clean the dirt at (7,6) from (7,5).

Therefore, the best action is to **move up to (7,6)** to clean the dirt there.

**Action: up**  
(Reason: Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning, and you must be on the dirt cell to clean it.)
  Decision: 'up' -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Dirt at (6,0).
  Thinking: You are at (6,0), and there is dirt at your position.  

Action: **clean**  
Reason: You can only gain apples when the river is clean, which requires cleaning dirt. Since you're on dirt, you must clean it first. Cleaning dirt gives no points directly, but it's necessary to enable apple spawning in the area. After cleaning, you can check if apples appear (though they only spawn on land when the river is clean).  

Next step: After cleaning, assess whether apples are now available to eat.  

Current action: **clean** ✅

--- Step 18 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Dirt at (7,3).
  Thinking: At (7,2), there is no apple visible, and the only item nearby is dirt at (7,3), which is directly below you.  

Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when there is no dirt), and dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning, I must first clean the dirt at (7,3) to potentially allow apples to spawn.  

However, I can only clean dirt if I am on the same cell as the dirt. Since I am at (7,2) and the dirt is at (7,3), I need to move down to (7,3) first.  

**Action: down**  
→ Move to (7,3), where the dirt is.  

Now I can clean it.  

**Action: clean**  
→ Removes dirt at (7,3).  

After cleaning, the river is cleaner at that location, which may allow apples to spawn on land (e.g., adjacent cells). But since apples only spawn *on land* when clean, and we don’t know if apples are now available, I cannot eat yet.  

But now that the dirt is cleaned, the land is ready — however, I must be on a cell with an apple
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,6). Dirt at (6,7), (7,6).
  Thinking: At (7,6), you are on a cell that has dirt. You can **clean** this dirt, which is necessary to potentially enable apple spawning later. However, cleaning dirt gives no points directly.

Currently, there is dirt at (6,7) and (7,6). Since you're at (7,6), you can clean that dirt immediately. Cleaning it will help make the area cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn on land — but apples only spawn when the river is clean, not directly on land.

However, the problem doesn't specify the river's location or how land connects to the river. Given that apples only spawn when the river is clean, and you can only clean dirt at your position, **your best immediate action is to clean the dirt at (7,6)**.

**Action: clean**  
Reason: Cleaning dirt is required to enable future apple spawning. You cannot eat an apple unless there's one, and apples only spawn when the river is clean — which depends on dirt being cleaned. Since you're on a dirt cell, cleaning it is necessary. Eating is not possible now.
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately.  

First, you must check your surroundings to find dirt (to clean) or apples (to eat). Since you're at (6,0), you should explore to find dirt or apples.  

**Action: left**  
→ Move to (5,0) to investigate.  

*Reasoning:* There's no apple visible, and cleaning dirt gives no points directly, but it's necessary to enable apples to spawn. Without dirt, no apples can appear. So, exploring to find dirt is essential. Starting by moving left allows you to check adjacent cells for dirt or potential apple spawns.  

**Next step: explore further until you find dirt or apples.**

--- Step 19 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Agent 3 at (5,0).
  Thinking: At (7,1), I am not currently on land with apples—apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt). Since I'm at (7,1), I need to assess whether there's dirt to clean or an apple to eat. However, no dirt or apple is mentioned directly.

Agent 3 is at (5,0), which is off to the left and down, so they are not in my immediate vicinity.

**Action Plan:**
- First, check if there's dirt at (7,1). If yes, clean it (cleaning gives no points but enables apple spawning).
- If no dirt, check if there's an apple. If yes, eat it (+1.0 point).
- If no apple and no dirt, stay or move to a better position where dirt exists or apples may spawn.

Since no specific state (dirt/apple) is given, **assume no apple is present** and **dirt may be present** (necessary for apple spawning).

👉 **Best action: clean** (if dirt is present), to enable future apple spawning.

**Final decision: clean**.
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,6). Dirt at (6,7).
  Thinking: At (7,6), you are not on dirt, so you cannot clean it directly. Dirt is at (6,7), which is adjacent but not currently occupied. To clean dirt, you must move to that cell first.

**Action: left** to move to (6,6) — not on dirt.  
Then **up** to (5,6), or **down** to (7,5)? Wait — dirt is at (6,7). So to reach (6,7), you need to go:

- From (7,6) → **left** to (6,6) → **up** to (5,6)? No — (6,7) is directly above (6,6).  
Actually: (6,7) is one up from (6,6), and one left from (7,7).

So path: (7,6) → **left** to (6,6) → **up** to (5,6)? No — (6,7) is at row 6, column 7.

So from (7,6):  
→ **up** to (6,6)  
→ **right** to (6,7)

Yes — so move **
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,0). Agent 1 at (7,1).
  Thinking: At (5,0), there's no apple visible, and the river is likely dirty (no apples spawn unless the river is clean). Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I need to assess whether cleaning dirt here would help.

However, I am at (5,0), and there's no indication of dirt or apple in this cell. Agent 1 is at (7,1), which is off-grid for immediate action. Without knowing if there's dirt at (5,0), I can't clean.

But since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and I can only clean dirt at my current position, I must first determine if there's dirt here.

**No dirt detected** → no clean action possible.  
**No apple** → can't eat.

Therefore, **best action: stay** — wait for information or opportunity to clean dirt elsewhere or move to a cell where dirt exists.

→ **Action: stay**.

--- Step 20 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Agent 3 at (5,0).
  Thinking: At (7,1), I am not directly adjacent to Agent 3 at (5,0), so there's no immediate threat or interaction.  

I need to assess:  
- Is there dirt here? If yes, I can clean it (but cleaning gives 0 points).  
- Are there apples? Only if the river is clean (i.e., dirt has been reduced).  

Since I'm at (7,1), I can only act on my current cell. If there's dirt, cleaning it helps the river become cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn elsewhere—eventually enabling me to eat them.  

But right now, I don’t have any information about dirt or apples at (7,1).  

**Action: stay**  
→ I stay to monitor the situation. If there's dirt, I might clean it later. If there's an apple, I can eat it. But without knowing the state of my cell, I can’t act with certainty.  

  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (8,1). Agent 1 at (7,1).
  Thinking: At (8,1), there is dirt. Since dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning, and apples only spawn on clean land, I need to clean the dirt to make it possible to eat an apple later.

**Action: clean**

Reasoning: I can only clean dirt at my current position. Cleaning the dirt at (8,1) is necessary to potentially enable apple spawning in the future. Eating is not possible yet because there's no apple—only dirt. Cleaning gives no points directly, but it's a prerequisite for apples to spawn. Thus, cleaning is the logical first step. 

→ **Action: clean**

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Agent 3 at (8,1).
  Thinking: At (7,1), I am adjacent to Agent 3 at (8,1). There's no information about dirt or apples currently in my cell, so I need to assess:

- If there's dirt, I can clean it (but cleaning gives 0 points).
- If there's an apple, I can eat it (+1.0 point).
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — so cleaning dirt is necessary but doesn't give points directly.

Since I don’t know the state of the cell (dirt or apple), and I’m not told that there’s an apple or dirt, I should **stay** to assess the situation.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: No immediate action (clean or eat) is justified without knowing the state of the cell. Staying allows observation or waiting for more information.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,3). Dirt at (7,4).
  Thinking: At (7,3), there is no apple visible. Dirt is at (7,4), which is directly below you. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and you can only clean dirt when you are on the same cell, you cannot clean the dirt at (7,4) from (7,3).

Therefore, the best action is to **move down to (7,4)** to clean the dirt.

**Action: down**  
Reason: Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning, and you must be on the dirt cell to clean it. Moving down allows you to clean the dirt and eventually create conditions for apples to spawn.
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Agent 1 at (7,1).
  Thinking: At (8,1), I am adjacent to Agent 1 at (7,1). There's no information about dirt or apples currently, so I must assess:

- I can only clean dirt or eat apples **on my current cell**.
- Apples only spawn **on land** when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt).
- Cleaning dirt gives **no points**, but enables apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives **+1.0 point**.

Since I don’t know the current state of dirt or apples at (8,1), and I’m not told there’s an apple, I should **first check if I can clean dirt** to possibly enable apple spawning.

**Action: clean**  
→ This is safe and necessary if dirt is present. Even if it gives no points, it may allow apples to spawn later.

**Next step:** After cleaning, if an apple appears, I can eat it.

**Final reasoning:**  
I must clean first to enable apple spawning. Without cleaning, no apples can appear.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Agent 2 at (7,2) Agent 3 at (8,1).
  Thinking: At (7,1), I am adjacent to Agent 2 at (7,2) and Agent 3 at (8,1). There's no mention of dirt or apples currently, so I need to assess:

- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned).
- Cleaning dirt gives no points but is required for apples to appear.
- I can only clean or eat what's directly at my position.

Currently, no dirt or apples are mentioned. Since I’m at (7,1), and no apple is visible, I cannot eat yet.

**Action: stay**  
Reasoning: I don’t know if there’s dirt or apples at (7,1). Without confirmation, I cannot clean or eat. Staying allows me to monitor the situation. If dirt is present, I can clean it later. If apples appear after cleaning, I can eat them. Moving might expose me to risk or waste opportunity.

Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first assess whether there's dirt nearby for me to clean.

Currently, no dirt is mentioned at my position or adjacent cells. Since I'm at (7,2), and there's no indication of dirt, I cannot clean anything. Also, no apple is visible at (7,2), so I cannot eat.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: No dirt to clean and no apple to eat. Staying is safe and allows monitoring the environment. If dirt appears or if the river state changes, I can act accordingly. No immediate benefit in moving.

Action: **clean**  
Reason: To enable apple spawning, the river must be clean. Since apples only appear on clean land, and we are at (8,1), cleaning this cell is necessary. Eating is not possible yet — we must first clean to potentially enable apples to spawn later.

  Thinking: At (7,1), I am adjacent to Agent 2 at (7,2) and Agent 3 at (8,1). There's no mention of dirt or apples currently, so I must assess:

- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned).
- Cleaning dirt gives no points, but is necessary for apples to appear.
- I can only act on my current cell.

Since there's no visible dirt or apple, and I don’t know the state of the river or dirt, I should **first check if there's dirt to clean** on my current cell (7,1).

But: no info on dirt at (7,1). So, I must assume it's either clean or dirty — and without knowing, I can't eat.

**Best action: stay** — to assess the situation further. If there's dirt, I can clean it. If there’s an apple, I can eat it. But without knowing, I can't act safely.

I must first determine if there's dirt nearby that I can clean to potentially spawn apples. However, I am at (7,2), and no dirt is mentioned directly. Without dirt to clean, I cannot spawn apples.

Best action: **stay** — to assess surroundings or wait for a dirt cell to become available.  

No apple to eat, no dirt to clean.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,4). Dirt at (8,5), (7,4).
  Thinking: At (6,4), I see dirt at (8,5) and (7,4). I cannot clean dirt that is not on my current cell.  

- I am at (6,4), so I can only clean dirt if it's on this cell. There's no dirt at (6,4).  
- Therefore, I cannot clean anything right now.  
- I cannot eat an apple because there's no apple mentioned at (6,4). Apples only spawn when the river is clean, but we don’t have information about apple locations — only dirt.  

Best action: **stay** — I can’t clean or eat anything useful right now.  

→ **Stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,7). Dirt at (6,8), (7,8), (7,6).
  Thinking: At (7,7), there is no apple currently. Dirt is at (6,8), (7,8), and (7,6) — all of which are adjacent or nearby, but not directly on your current position.

Since you can only clean dirt **if you are on the same cell**, and you're not on any of the dirt cells, you **cannot clean** them right now.

You also **cannot eat** an apple because there is none on (7,7).

**Best action: Move to a dirt cell to clean it.**

- (7,6) is directly below — move **down** to (7,6).
- From there, you can clean the dirt at (7,6), which helps make the river cleaner and enables apple spawning.

**Reasoning:** Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning. Without cleaning, no apples appear. Since you can't eat or clean from current position, moving to a dirt cell is the only progress.

  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Dirt at (8,1), (6,0), (8,0).
  Thinking: You are at (8,0).  
Dirt is at (8,1), (6,0), and (8,0) — so there's dirt at your current position and two others.

**Action analysis:**
- You **cannot eat** an apple at (8,0) because there's dirt there — apples only spawn on clean land.
- To spawn apples, the river must be clean (i.e., dirt must be removed).
- Cleaning dirt gives **0 points**, but is necessary to enable apple spawning.

**Best first step:**  
Clean the dirt at (8,0) — you're on it, so you can do it.  
After cleaning, (8,0) becomes clean.

Now, check if any apples can spawn:  
Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — but we don’t have apple spawn rules about exact conditions beyond "less dirt = more apples." So, reducing dirt increases chance.

Next, consider moving to clean other dirt (e.g., (8,1) or (6,0)) to improve overall cleanliness.

But **you can only act on your current cell**.

So:
- **Action: clean** at (8,0) → removes dirt, makes land

--- Step 4 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,4). Dirt at (8,5), (7,4).
  Thinking: At (6,4), I see dirt at (8,5) and (7,4). I am not on any dirt, so I cannot clean yet. Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. Since I can only clean dirt when I'm on a cell with dirt, I need to move to a dirt location to clean it.

Dirt is at (8,5) and (7,4). I am at (6,4). So I can move right to (7,4) — that's adjacent and on a dirt cell.

**Action: right** → move to (7,4)  
Now I'm on dirt, so I can clean it.

**Action: clean** → removes dirt at (7,4)  
Now dirt is only at (8,5)

After cleaning, the river is cleaner (less dirt), which increases chances of apple spawning. But I still need to check if apples are now available — however, the rule says apples spawn *when the river is clean*, but we don’t get apple spawn info directly. Since I can only eat apples when on a cell with one, and I don’t see any apple mentioned, I assume no apple is currently present.
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,6). Dirt at (7,6), (8,5).
  Thinking: At (7,6): There is dirt here, so I can **clean** it. Cleaning dirt doesn't give points, but it's necessary to enable apples to spawn later.  

There is no apple at (7,6) currently. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned.  

Since I'm at (7,6), and there's dirt here, I should **clean** it first.  

**Action: clean**  

After cleaning (7,6), the dirt is gone, and the cell becomes land. This increases the chance of apples spawning in the future.  

I cannot eat yet — no apple is present.  

**Next step:** After cleaning, I may want to check adjacent cells to see if apples appear or if more dirt needs cleaning. But currently, the only action possible is **clean**.  

✅ Reasoning: Clean dirt to enable future apple spawning. No point in eating now — no apple available.  

**Action: clean**
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Dirt at (8,1), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (8,0), you see dirt at (8,1) and (6,0). You cannot eat an apple yet because there are no apples visible — apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned).  

Action analysis:  
- **Clean (8,1)**: You can clean dirt at (8,1) since you're at (8,0) and adjacent. Cleaning this will help make the river cleaner, potentially enabling apple spawning.  
- **Clean (6,0)**: You are not adjacent to (6,0), so you cannot clean it directly. You’d need to move to (6,0) first.  

Best immediate move: **clean (8,1)**.  
This reduces dirt, improves river cleanliness, and may allow apples to spawn later.  

→ **Action: clean**

--- Step 5 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,4). Dirt at (8,5), (7,4).
  Thinking: At (7,4), you are on a cell with dirt. You can **clean** this dirt (since you're on it), which will help make the river cleaner and enable apples to spawn later. However, cleaning dirt gives **no points** directly.

Currently, there's dirt at (8,5) and (7,4). You are at (7,4), so you can clean that dirt immediately. After cleaning, the river will be cleaner, potentially allowing apples to spawn on land — but apples only appear when the river is clean, not immediately.

You cannot eat an apple yet because there's no apple mentioned at your current position.

**Best action: clean**  
→ This improves the environment for future apple spawning. You can't eat anything now, and cleaning is necessary to enable apples.

**Action: clean** ✅
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,6). Dirt at (8,5).
  Thinking: At (7,6), you are not on dirt, so you cannot clean it directly. Dirt is at (8,5), which is not adjacent to your current position. To clean dirt, you must move to a cell with dirt and then use the "clean" action. 

Currently, there are no apples visible, and since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), cleaning the dirt at (8,5) is necessary to enable apple spawning.

**Action: move right to (8,6)** — this is adjacent to (8,5), allowing you to eventually reach the dirt.  
Then, from (8,6), move down or left to (8,5) to clean it.

**Reasoning:** Cleaning dirt is essential to enable apple spawning. Without cleaning, no apples appear, and you cannot gain points. Moving toward (8,5) is the logical first step.

**Next step: move to (8,5) and clean.**  
After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn on land — then you can eat them for points.

**Final goal:** Clean dirt → enable apples → eat apples for points.  

✅ Action: **right** (

Agent 3 (Low-Level):

--- Step 50 ---
Agent 1 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 0). You see dirt at (6, 1).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 1).

Reasoning:

- There are no apples currently visible in the immediate vicinity. The nearest apple is at (13, 0), which is 7 units away — far beyond a direct, immediate reach.
- The dirt at (6, 1) is the nearest dirt patch, just one step away. Cleaning it will improve the river's cleanliness, which directly enables apple spawning in the future.
- Eating an apple now is not possible because no apple is within reach — the nearest apple is too far away, and there's no indication of any apple spawning nearby.
- Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite for future apple availability. This action supports the group's long-term goal of maximizing apple collection.
- There is no immediate reward for cleaning dirt, but it is a necessary step to unlock future rewards. In a cleanup game where progression depends on environmental improvement, this is a strategic investment.

Therefore, moving to (6, 1) to clean the dirt is the optimal choice. It enables future apple spawning and aligns with the core mechanics of the game. Once the river is cleaner, apples may appear in areas like (13, 0) or nearby
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 2). You see dirt at (6, 1) and agent 3 at (6, 3).
  Thinking: I should clean the dirt at (6, 1).

Reasoning:

- The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 6 units away — quite distant. Given that apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), and we currently have dirt at (6, 1) just one step away, there's a direct opportunity to improve the environment for future apple spawning.
- Eating an apple now would give +1.0 reward, but apples only appear *after* dirt is cleaned. Since there's currently no apple visible at (6, 2) or nearby, and the only apple is far at (12, 2), it's unlikely we'd get an apple immediately by just eating — especially since the apple at (12, 2) will only spawn if the river is clean.
- The dirt at (6, 1) is within one step of my current position (6, 2). Cleaning it is a minimal effort (one move) and will improve the condition of the river, enabling future apple spawning — including possibly at (12, 2) or nearby.
- Agent 3 is at (6, 3), which is adjacent to (6
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 3). You see agent 2 at (6, 2).
  Thinking: I need to carefully analyze the situation to determine the best course of action.

Currently, I am at (6, 3), and I see Agent 2 at (6, 2) — directly below me. The nearest apple is at (12, 2), which is 7 units away. The nearest dirt is at (6, 1), which is only 1 unit below me — very close and accessible.

Key facts:
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed).
- Cleaning dirt gives no immediate reward, but enables future apple spawning.
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point immediately.
- I cannot move diagonally.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

1. **Eat an apple immediately?**  
   The nearest apple is 7 units away — far from my current position. There's no apple in immediate range. I would have to travel to (12, 2), which is a long path. Given that, and no nearby apple, eating one now would be unproductive. Also, if I go to (12, 2), I'm leaving the dirt at (6,1) uncleaned — which could prevent future apple spawns.

--- Step 1 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,5). Dirt at (7,6), (7,4).
  Thinking: At (5,5), there's no apple currently. The dirt is at (7,6) and (7,4), which are not adjacent to you.  

To spawn apples, the river must be clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. But cleaning dirt gives no points, only enables apple spawning.  

Since I'm not on any dirt cells, I can't clean them yet. I need to move to a dirt cell to clean it.  

Best action: **move right to (6,5)** — closer to (7,6). Then eventually move to (7,6) to clean it. After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner, enabling apple spawning.  

But currently, I can't eat or clean.  

**Action: right** (to (6,5)) — to get closer to dirt and prepare to clean.  

(Reasoning: Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apples, and I can't eat anything now. Moving toward dirt is the logical next step.)
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (9,7). Dirt at (7,8), (7,6).
  Thinking: At (9,7), you are not on any dirt, so you cannot clean. There are no apples visible at your position.  

Dirt is at (7,8) and (7,6) — both are off-grid from your current position. To clean dirt, you must move to those cells.  

But: **Cleaning dirt gives no points**, only enables apple spawning *on land* when the river is clean.  

Currently, no apples are present, and you're not on dirt.  

**Action**: Move to a dirt cell (e.g., (7,8) or (7,6)) to clean it.  

→ **Best action: left** to (8,7), then continue left to (7,7) or (7,8) to clean.  

But first, check if apples can spawn. Since dirt is present, cleaning it will make the river clean, allowing apples to spawn *on land*.  

However, **apples only spawn on land when the river is clean** — so once dirt is cleaned, apples may appear on land cells (like (7,7), (8,7), etc.).  

But currently, no apples are visible.  

**Conclusion**:  
→ **Action: up**

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,6). Dirt at (8,6). Agent 2 at (8,6).
  Thinking: You are at (7,6). Dirt is at (8,6), and Agent 2 is also at (8,6).  

You cannot clean dirt at (8,6) because you're not on that cell.  
You cannot eat an apple there either, since there's no apple mentioned and the dirt is occupied by Agent 2.  

Best action: **move right** to (8,6) to either clean or interact — but since Agent 2 is there, you can't move there unless you can coordinate or the rules allow displacement. Assuming no interaction with other agents, and you can only act on your own cell:  

You must **stay** at (7,6) and **clean** only if you're on a dirt cell. You're not on dirt.  

So, **available action: stay**.  

No apples are present (river not clean yet), and cleaning is not possible.  

**Conclusion: stay** — no immediate benefit, but you cannot act otherwise.  

→ **Action: stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,6). Dirt at (8,6). Agent 1 at (7,6).
  Thinking: At (8,6), there is dirt. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when there's no dirt), we must clean the dirt to enable possible apple spawning.  

Action: **clean**  
Reason: Cleaning the dirt at (8,6) is necessary to make the cell "clean" and potentially allow apples to spawn. Eating is not possible yet because there's no apple—only dirt. Cleaning is required first.  

After cleaning, if apples spawn (which depends on game state not fully given), we can then consider eating. But currently, only cleaning is possible and necessary.  

✅ Action: **clean**
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Dirt at (7,2), (6,0), (8,0).
  Thinking: At (7,1), you are not on any dirt, so you can't clean. There's no apple visible at your position.  

Dirt is at (7,2), (6,0), (8,0) — only (7,2) is adjacent to you.  

**Action: move up to (6,1)** — not helpful.  
**Action: move down to (7,2)** — now you're on dirt.  

→ **Clean (7,2)** → now that dirt is cleaned, it may help the river become cleaner, enabling apple spawning.  

After cleaning (7,2), the river becomes cleaner (one less dirt), which increases apple spawning chance.  

**Next step**: Monitor if apples appear — they only spawn on land when river is clean.  

But since apples only spawn *on land* and you can only eat when on an apple, and you don’t currently see an apple, **you must first clean dirt to enable apples**.  

✅ **Best action: move down to (7,2) and clean it.**  

This helps the river become cleaner, which enables apples to spawn on land. Then you can move to areas with apples.  

**Final answer: down

--- Step 12 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,6). Agent 2 at (8,6).
  Thinking: At (7,6), I am adjacent to Agent 2 at (8,6). There's no information about dirt or apples currently in my cell, so I must assess the situation.

Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I should first check whether there's dirt at my current position. If there is dirt, I can clean it to enable potential apple spawning.

However, no dirt or apple status is given. Without knowing if there's dirt or apples at (7,6), I cannot eat or clean safely.

**Best action: stay**  
Reason: I need to assess the environment first. If I move, I risk missing an opportunity or stepping into an area with no apples or dirt. Staying allows me to evaluate whether I can clean dirt (to enable apple spawning) or eat an apple if present. 

→ **Action: stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,6). Agent 1 at (7,6).
  Thinking: At (8,6), I am currently on a cell. Agent 1 is at (7,6), directly to the left.  

To maximize points:  
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned).  
- Cleaning dirt gives no points, but is necessary to allow apples to spawn.  
- Eating apples gives +1.0 each.  

Since I am at (8,6), and there’s no mention of dirt or apples currently present, I must first assess whether I can clean dirt to enable apple spawning. However, I don’t have information about whether (8,6) has dirt or not.  

Without knowing if there’s dirt to clean, I can’t proceed to eat an apple.  

**Best action: stay**  
→ To observe the environment and determine if there's dirt to clean. If dirt is present, I can clean it. Once clean, apples may spawn, and I can then eat them.  

**Reasoning**: Cleaning dirt is necessary for apples to appear. Without confirming dirt presence, cleaning or eating is premature. Staying allows for safe assessment.  

→ **Action: stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Dirt at (6,0), (8,0).
  Thinking: At (7,0), you are adjacent to dirt at (6,0) and (8,0). Since you can only clean dirt if you are on the same cell, and there's no dirt at your current position (7,0), you cannot clean dirt right now.

However, to enable apples to spawn, the river must be clean — meaning all dirt must be removed. Apples only appear on land when the river is clean. Since dirt is present at (6,0) and (8,0), the river is not clean, so no apples are currently spawning.

**Action: clean** — but only if you are on a dirt cell. You are at (7,0), which has no dirt. So you cannot clean dirt from here.

Therefore, **you cannot eat any apple** at this time.

**Best action: move to a dirt cell** (e.g., move left to (6,0) or right to (8,0)) to clean it.

👉 **Action: left** (to (6,0)) — now you can clean dirt and move toward a cleaner river.

**Reasoning:** Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning. Since you're currently not on dirt, you must move to a

--- Step 13 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,6). Agent 2 at (8,6).
  Thinking: At (7,6), I am adjacent to Agent 2 at (8,6). There's no information about dirt or apples currently in my cell.  

Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when there's less dirt), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary for apples to appear, I should first assess whether I can clean dirt to enable apple spawning.  

However, I don’t have any information about the dirt status of my current cell. Without knowing if there’s dirt here, I can’t clean.  

Therefore, my best action is to **clean** if dirt is present — but since I don’t know, I must assume caution.  

But since the goal is to maximize points via eating apples, and apples only appear when the river is clean, I must first ensure the environment is clean.  

→ **Action: clean** (to enable potential apple spawning in my cell, if dirt exists).  

This is the most strategic first step. If dirt is present, cleaning it will allow apples to spawn later. If not, I can proceed to eat if an apple is already there.  

**Final action: clean**.
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,6). Agent 1 at (7,6).
  Thinking: At (8,6), I am currently on a cell. There's no mention of dirt or an apple in this location. Agent 1 is at (7,6), which is adjacent to me, but agents don’t affect my actions directly.

Since there's no apple visible and no dirt mentioned, I cannot eat. To potentially spawn apples, the river must be clean — but I don’t have information about the river or dirt status.

**Action: stay**  
Reasoning: Without knowing if there's dirt to clean or an apple to eat, and since I can only act on my current cell, staying is safest. If dirt is present, I can clean it later. If apples appear after cleaning, I can eat them. Moving without a clear goal risks missing opportunities.  

**Final decision: stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,6). Dirt at (6,7).
  Thinking: At (6,6), there is no apple currently. Dirt is at (6,7), which is directly below you. Since you can only clean dirt or eat apples when on the same cell, you must move to (6,7) to clean it.

**Action: down**  
→ Move to (6,7) to clean the dirt.  
Cleaning dirt gives no points, but it improves the river's cleanliness, which may allow apples to spawn in the future (especially on land).  

After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner, potentially enabling apple spawning on land cells (like (6,6) or nearby).  

Next step: After cleaning, check if apples have spawned or if you should move to a land cell to eat.  

**Reasoning:** Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning. Without cleaning, no apples will appear. So, clean first.  

**Next action: down** (to clean dirt at (6,7)) ✅
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,0). Agent 1 at (7,1).
  Thinking: At (5,0), there's no apple visible, and the river is not clean (implied by the absence of apples). Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points, we must first determine if there's dirt to clean.

Agent 1 is at (7,1), which is off our current position. We need to assess whether we can move to a dirt-covered area to clean it, which would eventually allow apples to spawn.

However, the current situation at (5,0) does not indicate dirt or an apple. Without knowing the grid state (e.g., dirt locations), we can't confirm if cleaning is possible here.

**Best action: stay**  
→ Reason: We don't have evidence of dirt or an apple at (5,0). Moving without knowing the terrain may lead to wasted steps. Staying allows us to assess the situation or wait for a better opportunity to clean and eventually eat apples.

--- Step 21 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Agent 3 at (5,0).
  Thinking: At (7,1), I am not on a river cell, so there's no immediate dirt to clean. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning I need to first ensure the river is clean to enable apple spawning. However, I don’t currently have access to the river or dirt to clean.

Agent 3 is at (5,0), which is likely on or near the river. Since I can only clean dirt at my current position, and there's no dirt visible at (7,1), I cannot clean anything here.

**Best action: stay**  
I remain at (7,1) to assess the situation. If there's dirt nearby or if the river is nearby, I may need to move. But with no dirt or apple visible, and no apple-spawning condition met yet, cleaning isn't possible here. Eating is not possible either.

→ **Stay** (no action that yields points or progress is available).
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,6). Dirt at (6,7).
  Thinking: At (6,6), there is no apple, but there is dirt at (6,7), which is directly to the south. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when there's no dirt), I need to clean the dirt at (6,7) to potentially enable apple spawning.

However, I can only clean dirt if I am on the same cell as the dirt. So I must move to (6,7) first.

**Action: move down to (6,7)**  
Now I am on the dirt cell.  

**Action: clean**  
Cleaning the dirt at (6,7) removes it and improves the river's cleanliness, which may allow apples to spawn on nearby land cells (though spawning isn't explicitly triggered in the rules, it's implied that cleaner conditions enable apple presence).

After cleaning, if apples spawn, I can then eat them. But since no apples are mentioned, and the rule says apples only spawn when the river is clean, I now have a clean river condition.

**Next step**: Check if any apples have spawned (but not specified in current state). Since no apples are visible, and I can only eat what's on my current cell, I should stay in (6
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,0). Agent 1 at (7,1).
  Thinking: At (5,0), I am not on land with apples currently, and there's no indication of dirt to clean. Agent 1 is at (7,1), but that doesn’t affect my action directly.  

Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is removed), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first check if there's dirt at my current position.  

However, I have no information about dirt at (5,0). Assuming there is no dirt visible, and no apple is present, I cannot eat.  

Best action: **stay** — to assess the environment further. If dirt is present, I can clean it later. If apples appear, I can eat them.  

**Action: stay**.

--- Step 22 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Agent 3 at (5,0).
  Thinking: At (7,1), I am not on a cell with an apple, and I need to assess whether cleaning dirt or eating an apple is possible.

- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when there's less dirt).  
- Cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary to enable apple spawning.  
- I can only act on my current cell.

Since I’m at (7,1), and there's no information about dirt or apples at that location, I must first determine if there's dirt to clean or an apple to eat.

But no details are given about the state of (7,1) — whether it has dirt or an apple.

**Best action**: *clean* — because cleaning dirt enables apple spawning later, and without cleaning, apples won’t appear. Even though cleaning gives no points, it's a prerequisite for earning points via apples.

**Reasoning**: Without cleaning, I cannot get apples. So, to maximize future points, I must clean first.

✅ Action: **clean**
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,6). Dirt at (6,7).
  Thinking: At (6,6), there is no apple visible. Dirt is at (6,7), which is directly below you. Since you can only clean dirt or eat apples when on the same cell, you cannot clean (6,7) from (6,6) — you'd need to move there first.

Action: **down** to (6,7) to clean the dirt.

Reasoning: Cleaning dirt is necessary to improve the river's cleanliness and enable apple spawning. Without cleaning, apples won't spawn. Moving down to (6,7) allows you to clean it, which may eventually lead to apples appearing in the area (especially if the river becomes cleaner). Eating is not possible yet, as there's no apple on (6,7).  

Next step: clean dirt at (6,7).  

Action: **clean**.
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,0). Agent 1 at (7,1).
  Thinking: At (5,0), I am not on land with apples yet. The river is currently dirty, so no apples are spawning. To get apples, I need to clean dirt first to make the river clean, which enables apple spawning.

But I can only clean dirt *on my current cell*. So I must check if (5,0) has dirt. Since the initial state isn't specified, and apples only spawn when the river is clean, I assume (5,0) currently has dirt (as it's not a known apple location).

Action: **clean**  
→ This will reduce dirt on my cell, potentially making the river cleaner in that area, which may allow apples to spawn later.

After cleaning, I can assess whether apples appear and if I should move to eat them.

**Next step**: After cleaning, check if apples spawn. If yes, then eat them. If not, consider moving to other land cells that might have apples (e.g., near Agent 1 at (7,1)).

But for now:  
✅ **Action: clean**  
Reason: Apples only spawn when the river is clean. Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning. I must clean first to enable future apple eating.
Current move: **clean**.

--- Step 33 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Agent 2 at (7,2) Agent 3 at (8,1).
  Thinking: At (7,1), there's no apple visible, and the river is not clean yet. Agent 2 is at (7,2), and Agent 3 is at (8,1). Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first clean dirt at my position to potentially enable apple spawning.

But I don't currently see dirt or any indication of dirt at (7,1). If there's no dirt, I can't clean it. So, I need to assess: is there dirt at (7,1)? Since it's not stated, and the agents are nearby, perhaps the river is currently dirty and needs cleaning.

Since I can only clean dirt on my cell, and I don’t have confirmation of dirt at (7,1), I should **stay** to assess the situation further. If dirt is present, I can clean it. If not, no apple will spawn anyway.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: No dirt is visible, and I cannot eat an apple without first cleaning dirt to enable spawning. Staying allows me to monitor or prepare for future actions.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Agent 1 at (7,1) Agent 3 at (8,1).
  Thinking: At (7,2), I am not on a cell with an apple, and there's no indication of dirt to clean. Agent 1 is at (7,1), and Agent 3 is at (8,1). Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points, I must first assess if there's dirt nearby to clean.

Currently, no dirt is mentioned, and I’m not on a cell with an apple. Therefore, I cannot eat. 

Best action: **stay** — to monitor the situation. If dirt appears or if agents move, I may be able to act later.  

**Reasoning**: No apple available, no dirt to clean, and no immediate benefit to move. Staying allows for situational awareness.  

**Action: stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Agent 1 at (7,1) Agent 2 at (7,2).
  Thinking: At (8,1), there is no apple visible, and the river is not clean (dirt is present). Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first clean any dirt to enable apple spawning.

However, I am at (8,1). There’s no indication of dirt directly at my position. I need to assess the surrounding area.

Agent 1 is at (7,1), Agent 2 at (7,2). They may be near dirt or could be blocking access. But since I can only act on my current cell, and there's no dirt mentioned at (8,1), I cannot clean dirt here.

No apple is present at (8,1), so I cannot eat.

Best action: **stay** — because I cannot clean dirt or eat an apple at this position, and moving without a clear benefit would be unproductive.

**Reasoning**: No dirt to clean, no apple to eat. Staying is safe and optimal until more information is available.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Agent 2 at (7,2) Agent 3 at (8,1).
  Thinking: At (7,1), there's no apple visible, and the river is not clean (no dirt cleaning mentioned). Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and we have no indication of dirt at this location, we cannot eat an apple.

Agent 2 is at (7,2), Agent 3 at (8,1) — no direct threat or benefit noted.

Available actions:
- **clean**: Only effective if there's dirt on the current cell. No dirt mentioned → no benefit.
- **eat**: No apple present → invalid.
- **move**: To explore and possibly find dirt or clean it.

**Best action: move right to (7,2)** — to check Agent 2’s position. If there’s dirt there, we can clean it and potentially enable apple spawning. Alternatively, moving might reveal a dirt cell we can clean.

**Reasoning**: Cleaning dirt is necessary to spawn apples, and apples give points. Without cleaning, no apples. We must first clean dirt to enable apple spawning. Moving to (7,2) is logical as it's adjacent and may have dirt.

→ **Action: right**.
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Agent 1 at (7,1) Agent 3 at (8,1).
  Thinking: At (7,2), there's no apple visible, and the river is not clean yet (no dirt cleaning has been done). To spawn apples, the river must be clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. Since I'm at (7,2), I can only clean dirt if there is dirt on my cell. There's no indication of dirt at (7,2), so I cannot clean anything here.

Agent 1 is at (7,1), and Agent 3 is at (8,1) — both on the river side. If the river is dirty, apples won’t spawn. But since no dirt is mentioned, and I’m not on a dirt cell, I can't clean or eat.

**Best action: stay**  
Reason: I’m not on a dirt cell, so I can't clean. There's no apple here, so I can't eat. Moving would not help without dirt to clean or apples to eat. Staying is safe and optimal until more information is available.

**Action: stay** ✅
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Agent 1 at (7,1) Agent 2 at (7,2).
  Thinking: At (8,1), there's no apple visible, and the river is likely dirty (since apples only spawn when the river is clean). To get apples, I must first clean dirt — but I can only clean dirt on my current cell.

Currently, I am at (8,1). There's no indication of dirt on this cell, so I can't clean it. Also, Agent 1 is at (7,1) and Agent 2 at (7,2), which may imply activity nearby, but they don't affect me directly.

Since I can't eat (no apple), and I can't clean (no dirt to clean), the best action is to **move** to a position where I can either clean dirt or find an apple.

Looking at possible moves:
- Moving left to (7,1) — occupied by Agent 1 (no info on their actions, but I can't move there unless it's safe).
- Moving down to (8,2) — unknown state.
- Moving up to (8,2) — same.
- Moving right — unknown.

But since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and cleaning gives no points, I must first **clean dirt** to enable apple spawning.

--- Step 35 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Dirt at (8,0). Agent 2 at (7,2) Agent 3 at (8,1).
  Thinking: At (7,1), there is no apple visible, and the only dirt is at (8,0), which is not adjacent to your position. You are not on any dirt cell, so you cannot clean it directly. Agent 2 is at (7,2), and Agent 3 is at (8,1) — neither is directly helpful for immediate action.

To spawn apples, the river must be clean (i.e., dirt removed), but apples only appear *on land* when the river is clean. Since you're at (7,1), you can only clean dirt if you're on a dirt cell. You are not currently on dirt.

**Action:** Move to (8,0) to clean the dirt there.  
→ After cleaning (8,0), the river becomes cleaner, which may enable apple spawning on adjacent land cells (e.g., (8,1) or (7,0), etc.).

**Next step:** After cleaning, check if apples appear on land cells adjacent to the now-clean river. Then, move to eat them.

**Best immediate action: right → (8,1)** (to get closer to the dirt at (8,0))  
But (8,1) has Agent 3 —
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Agent 1 at (7,1) Agent 3 at (8,1).
  Thinking: At (7,2), I am not on a dirt cell, so I can't clean. There's no apple visible here, and no indication that apples are spawning. Apples only appear when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned). Since I'm not on dirt, I can't clean it, and thus no apples can spawn.

Agent 1 is at (7,1), directly below me. Agent 3 is at (8,1), to my right. These agents may be relevant if they are cleaning or eating, but I have no information about their actions.

**Best action: stay**  
I remain at (7,2) to monitor the situation. If I move, I risk moving away from potential dirt or apple spawn zones without a clear reason. Since I can't clean or eat here, staying is the safest and most strategic choice until more information is available.

  Obs: You at (8,0). Dirt at (8,1), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (8,0), you see dirt at (8,1) and (6,0).  

- You **cannot eat** an apple right now because there's no apple visible. Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned.  
- You can **clean dirt only if you are on the same cell** as the dirt.  
- You are at (8,0), so you can **clean (8,1)** if you move there, but you cannot clean (6,0) from (8,0) — you’d need to move there first.  

**Best action: move up to (7,0)** — to get closer to (8,1) and possibly reach it next. But wait: you can only clean dirt **on your current cell**.  

So, currently, you are at (8,0). There's **no dirt at (8,0)** — only at (8,1) and (6,0). So you **cannot clean any dirt now**.  

Thus, **you cannot eat any apple** and **no clean action is possible**.  

**Action: stay** — because no cleaning is possible, and no apple is present.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,4). Dirt at (8,5).
  Thinking: You are at (7,4). Dirt is at (8,5).  

To clean dirt, you must be on the same cell as the dirt. You are not on (8,5), so you cannot clean it directly.  

You can move to (8,5) to clean it. After cleaning, the river will be cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn on land — but only if apples spawn on land cells (not necessarily at (8,5)).  

However, since you can only eat apples when on a land cell with an apple, and apples only spawn when the river is clean, cleaning the dirt is necessary but doesn't give points.  

**Action: right → (8,4), then down → (8,5)**  
Wait — from (7,4), move right to (8,4), then down to (8,5).  

But (8,5) is dirt. You can only clean dirt when you are on that cell.  

So:  
→ Move to (8,5) (via right then down, or directly down from (7,5)? But (7,5) is not given).  

From (7,4):  
- Move right → (8,4)
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,6). Dirt at (7,7), (8,5).
  Thinking: At (8,6), I see dirt at (7,7) and (8,5). I am not on any dirt, so I cannot clean right now.  

Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. Since I’m not on dirt, I can’t clean it directly.  

To maximize points, I must first clean dirt to enable apple spawning.  

I can move to a dirt cell to clean it.  

Available dirt cells: (7,7) and (8,5).  

- (8,5) is directly below me (down from (8,6)).  
- (7,7) is up-left.  

Moving to (8,5) is closer and more direct.  

**Action: down** to (8,5) → clean dirt.  

This cleans (8,5), which may allow apples to spawn on adjacent land cells.  

After cleaning, I can then explore for apples or clean more dirt.  

**Reasoning**: Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apples. I must first clean a dirt cell to progress. Moving down to (8,5) is optimal due to proximity.  

**Next action: down** → clean (8,5).
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Dirt at (8,1), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (8,0), you see dirt at (8,1) and (6,0). You cannot eat an apple yet because there are no apples present — apples only spawn when the river is clean, which depends on dirt being cleaned.

**Action: clean (8,1)**  
- You are at (8,0), so (8,1) is directly above you.  
- You can only clean dirt if you are on the same cell as the dirt.  
→ So you **cannot clean (8,1)** from (8,0).  
→ You **can only clean dirt if you are on the cell with dirt**.

So, dirt at (8,1) is not accessible from (8,0) unless you move there first.

Dirt at (6,0) is to the left — you can move left to (6,0) and then clean it.

**Best move: left to (6,0)**  
→ Then clean (6,0) → reduces dirt → improves river cleanliness → may enable apple spawning.

After cleaning, if the river becomes clean (no dirt), apples may spawn on land — then you can eat them.

  Obs: You at (8,4). Dirt at (8,5). Agent 2 at (8,5).
  Thinking: You are at (8,4). Dirt is at (8,5), and Agent 2 is also at (8,5).  

You cannot clean dirt at (8,5) because you are not on that cell. You must move to (8,5) to clean it.  

However, Agent 2 is already there — if Agent 2 is occupying the cell, you cannot move there or clean it unless the rules allow movement/interaction with another agent (which they don't, as per standard rules).  

Therefore:  
- You **cannot clean** the dirt.  
- You **cannot eat** an apple (no apple is present at (8,4) or elsewhere, as apples only spawn when river is clean — and it's not clean yet).  
- You **cannot move** to (8,5) because Agent 2 is there.  

Best action: **stay** — you gain 0 points, but avoid unnecessary risks or conflicts.  

**Final action: stay**.

Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,5). Dirt at (8,5). Agent 1 at (8,4).
  Thinking: At (8,5), there is dirt, and you can clean it. Cleaning dirt gives no points, but it's necessary to enable apples to spawn later. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), cleaning the dirt at (8,5) is essential.

Currently, there's no apple visible, and you're not on a cell with one. Eating is not possible yet. The only action that makes sense is to **clean** the dirt.

**Action: clean**  
Reason: Cleaning the dirt at (8,5) is required to allow apples to spawn in the future. Without cleaning, no apples can appear. Eating is not possible now, and staying or moving would not help until the environment is cleaned.
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Dirt at (8,1), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (7,0), you are on land. There's dirt at (8,1) and (6,0). You can only clean dirt or eat apples **if you are on the same cell**.

- You **cannot** eat an apple at (7,0) because there's no apple mentioned there.
- You **can** clean dirt **only if you are on the same cell** as the dirt. You are not on (8,1) or (6,0), so you **cannot clean** those dirt cells directly.
- Therefore, **no action** (up, down, left, right, clean, eat) can be taken right now that yields a benefit.

**Best action: move to (6,0) or (8,1)** to clean dirt.

- Moving to (6,0): you can clean the dirt there.
- Moving to (8,1): you can clean the dirt there.

**Best choice: move left to (6,0)** — closer, and cleaning dirt enables apple spawning later.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,4). Agent 2 at (8,5).
  Thinking: At (8,4), I am on land. Agent 2 is at (8,5), directly above me.  

First, check if there's an apple here: no information says there is one, so I cannot eat.  
Is the cell dirty? Not specified, so assume it's not dirty unless known otherwise.  

Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I should only clean if dirt is present.  

No dirt is indicated, so I don’t need to clean.  

No apple is visible, so I cannot eat.  

Best action: **stay** — to monitor the situation, possibly wait for apple spawning (which depends on river cleanliness).  

But wait — if I stay, and there's no apple, and no dirt, nothing happens.  

However, if I move to check adjacent cells, I might find dirt or apples. But only if there's dirt to clean or apples to eat.  

No information about dirt or apples elsewhere.  

Thus, safest and most rational move: **stay**.  

You must move to clean
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (9,0). Dirt at (8,1), (8,0).
  Thinking: At (9,0), you are adjacent to dirt at (8,0) and (8,1). You cannot clean dirt at (8,1) because you're not on that cell. You can only clean dirt if you are on the same cell.

Currently, you are at (9,0), which has no dirt. There's no apple visible at your position.

**Action: clean** — you can only clean dirt *on your current cell*. Since (9,0) has no dirt, cleaning does nothing.

**Best next step: move left to (8,0)** — that cell has dirt. Now you can clean it.

After cleaning (8,0), the river becomes cleaner (dirt reduced), which may allow apples to spawn on land (though spawning depends on overall river cleanliness, not just one cell).

Then, if apples spawn, you can eat them.

**Conclusion: Move left to (8,0), then clean.**  
This is necessary to progress toward enabling apple spawning.

  Obs: You at (6,5). Dirt at (7,6), (8,5), (7,4).
  Thinking: At (6,5), I see dirt at (7,6), (8,5), and (7,4). I am not on any dirt, so I cannot clean it directly. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning I need to clean dirt to enable apple spawning.

Currently, I am at (6,5). The closest dirt is at (8,5) — directly to my right. I can move to (8,5) to clean it.

**Action: right → move to (8,5)**  
Now I am on (8,5), which has dirt.  
**Action: clean** → removes dirt at (8,5).  

Now, dirt at (7,6) and (7,4) remain. I can move to (7,6) or (7,4) next.  
(7,6) is up-left from (8,5), (7,4) is down-left.  

Let’s go to (7,6):  
**Action: up-left → move to (7,6)**  
Clean dirt at (7,6).  

Now only (7,4) remains.  
**Action: down-left → move to (7
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,7). Dirt at (6,8), (7,8), (7,6).
  Thinking: At (8,7), you are not on any dirt cells. The dirt is at (6,8), (7,8), (7,6) — all of which are not adjacent to your current position.  

To eat an apple, the river must be clean (i.e., dirt must be cleaned), and apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Since you are not on dirt, you cannot clean it directly.  

**Action:** Stay.  
**Reason:** You cannot clean dirt or eat apples from your current position. Moving would not help unless you reach a dirt cell. Since no dirt is adjacent, you cannot clean anything now. Staying is safe and allows you to assess future opportunities.  

**Next step:** Move toward a dirt cell (e.g., (7,8) or (7,6)) to clean it. But currently, no action yields immediate benefit.  

→ **Best action: stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Dirt at (8,1), (6,0), (8,0).
  Thinking: At (8,0), you are on a cell that has dirt. You can **clean** dirt only if you are on a cell with dirt.  

Current situation:
- You are at (8,0) → has dirt → you can **clean** it.
- Dirt at (8,1), (6,0), (8,0) → so (8,1) and (6,0) are also dirt cells.

**Action: clean**  
→ Cleaning (8,0) removes dirt from that cell.  
→ This helps make the river cleaner (reduces dirt), which may allow apples to spawn in the future.  
→ But cleaning gives **no points**.  

After cleaning (8,0), dirt is now only at (8,1) and (6,0).  

Now, can you eat an apple?  
Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — but we don’t know where apples are, or if any have spawned.  
Currently, no apples are mentioned, so likely none exist yet.  

So, best immediate action: **clean** to improve conditions for future apple spawning.  

**Final action: clean** ✅

--- Step 3 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,5). Dirt at (7,6), (7,4).
  Thinking: At (5,5), there's no apple currently, and you're not on any dirt cells. The dirt is at (7,6) and (7,4), which are not adjacent to your current position.

To get apples, the river must be clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. But cleaning dirt gives no points — only apples give points.

Since you're at (5,5), you can move to get closer to the dirt at (7,6) or (7,4). The closest dirt is (7,6) — one step right to (6,6), then down to (7,6). But cleaning dirt requires being on that cell.

Best action: **move right to (6,5)**, then **down to (7,5)** — now you're adjacent to (7,6). From there, you can **clean (7,6)**. Similarly, (7,4) is farther, so focus on one dirt cell first.

After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner, enabling apple spawning on land — but apples only spawn when the river is clean, and they appear on land (not on water or dirt). Since we don't have land locations specified, we assume apples appear on land cells when
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,7). Dirt at (6,8), (7,8), (7,6).
  Thinking: At (8,7), you are not on any dirt cells. The dirt is at (6,8), (7,8), (7,6) — all of which are not adjacent to your current position.

To eat apples, the river must be clean (i.e., dirt must be removed), and apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Since you can only clean dirt *at your position*, and you are not on any dirt cells, you **cannot clean any dirt right now**.

Therefore, **you cannot eat an apple** (no apples are spawning yet, because dirt is still present elsewhere and not cleaned).

Action: **stay**  
Reason: You are not on dirt, so you can't clean. No apples are available. Staying allows you to assess movement to a dirt cell in the future.  

Next step: Move to a dirt cell (e.g., (7,8) or (7,6)) to clean it.  

→ Best action: **left** to (7,7), then possibly down or up to reach (7,6) or (7,8).  

But based on immediate options:  
**stay** is safest and most logical.  

✅ Final action: **stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Dirt at (8,1), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (8,0), you see dirt at (8,1) and (6,0).  

- You **cannot eat** an apple yet because there are no apples visible. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned.  
- You can **clean dirt only if you're on the same cell** as the dirt.  
- You are at (8,0), so you can **clean the dirt at (8,1)** only if you move there.  
- The dirt at (6,0) is not adjacent — you’d need to move to (6,0) to clean it.  

**Best action**: Move **up** to (8,1) to clean the dirt there.  

Cleaning dirt at (8,1) will help make the river cleaner, enabling apple spawning (eventually).  

**Action: up**.  

(No point in eating yet — no apples present. Cleaning is necessary first.)

  Thinking: At (6,5), I see dirt at (7,6), (8,5), and (7,4). I am not on any dirt, so I cannot clean it yet. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning I need to clean dirt to make land appear and allow apples to spawn.

Since I can only clean dirt **when I am on a cell with dirt**, I need to move to one of those dirt cells to clean them.

- (7,6): I can move to (7,6) via right then up (or down then right) — possible.
- (8,5): directly right from (6,5) → (7,5) → (8,5): requires two moves.
- (7,4): move down to (6,4), then right to (7,4) — possible.

Best move: **right to (7,5)**, then **down to (8,5)** — but (8,5) is dirt, so I can clean it from there.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Agent 3 at (5,0).
  Thinking: At (7,1), I am not currently on land with apples, and there's no indication of dirt to clean. Agent 3 is at (5,0), which is far away and not relevant to my current position.  

To maximize points, I must first **clean dirt** (if present) to enable apple spawning, then **eat apples** when they appear. Since I'm at (7,1), I need to check if there's dirt here. If there is, I can clean it. If not, I may need to move to a location with dirt to clean.  

But with no details on surroundings (e.g., dirt at (7,1)?), the safest action is:  

👉 **clean** (if dirt is present) — because cleaning is necessary to enable apples to spawn.  

If no dirt is present, then I might need to move. But with current info, I assume dirt may be present or nearby.  

**Action: clean**.  

(Reason: Cleaning is required to spawn apples; eating apples gives points, but only after clean land. Without cleaning, no apples can spawn.)
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,5). Dirt at (7,6), (8,4).
  Thinking: At (6,5), you are not on any dirt, so you cannot clean. There's no apple visible at your position.  

Dirt is at (7,6) and (8,4) — both are not adjacent to (6,5), so you can't reach them directly without moving.  

To spawn apples, the river must be clean (i.e., dirt removed). But since you can only clean dirt when you're on the same cell, you must move to a dirt cell to clean it.  

**Action:** Move to (7,6) to clean dirt.  
After cleaning (7,6), the river becomes cleaner — apples may now spawn on land. Then, you can move to a land cell with apples to eat them.  

**Next step:** Clean (7,6) → then possibly move to (8,4) to clean that too → then check for apples.  

But currently:  
→ No apple at (6,5)  
→ Can't eat or clean from here  

**Best action now: move right to (7,5) → then down to (7,6)** to clean.  

**Final reasoning:** You must clean dirt to enable apple spawning. Start by moving to (
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,0). Agent 1 at (7,1).
  Thinking: At (5,0), I am not on a cell with an apple (no apple spawn mentioned), and there's no dirt indicated to clean. Agent 1 is at (7,1), which is irrelevant unless there's interaction—none is specified.

Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and I have no dirt to clean or apple to eat, I cannot gain points.

**Best action: stay**  
→ No immediate benefit from moving. No dirt to clean, no apple to eat. Staying is safe and neutral.

**Reasoning:** Without dirt to clean or an apple present, no action yields points. Staying avoids unnecessary movement and conserves position for potential future use when clean land or apples appear.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Agent 3 at (5,0).
  Thinking: At (7,1), I am not on a cell with an apple, and I don't know the current state of the river or dirt. Agent 3 is at (5,0), which is far away and not relevant to my current position unless there's interaction — but there is none in the rules.

Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first determine if there's dirt at my current position.

I don't see any dirt or apple in the description, so I can't assume either.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: I need to assess whether there's dirt to clean or an apple to eat. Without knowing the state of the cell at (7,1), I cannot safely act. Staying allows me to observe or wait for more information. If dirt is present, I can clean it; if an apple is present, I can eat it. Since no apple or dirt is mentioned, staying is safest and most informed.  

→ **stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Dirt at (7,6), (8,4).
  Thinking: At (7,5), there is no apple currently. Dirt is at (7,6) and (8,4), both of which are not adjacent to your position.  

To spawn apples, the river must be clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. Since you're at (7,5), you can only clean dirt if you're on the same cell.  

- (7,6) is directly above you — you can move up to (7,6) to clean it.  
- (8,4) is not adjacent — you’d need to move there, but it’s farther and not currently reachable in one step.  

**Action:** Move up to (7,6) to clean the dirt.  
After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn (though not immediately visible).  

**Next step:** After cleaning (7,6), check if apples appear — but since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and no apple is visible now, you can only eat if one appears.  

**Final decision:** Move up to clean (7,6).  

✅ Action: up
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,0). Agent 1 at (7,1).
  Thinking: At (5,0), there's no apple visible, and the river is likely dirty (no apples spawn yet). To enable apple spawning, I need to clean dirt. However, I can only clean dirt on my current cell.

Since I'm at (5,0), I must first check if there's dirt there. If there is, I can clean it. Cleaning dirt doesn't give points, but it helps make the river cleaner, which increases apple spawning chances.

No apples are available to eat yet, and I don't have information about dirt at (5,0). Without knowing if there's dirt, I can't proceed with cleaning.

But based on standard game logic: **cleaning is necessary to enable apple spawning**, so I should clean if possible.

Action: **clean** (if dirt is present at (5,0)).

→ Reason: Cleaning dirt enables apple spawning, which is required to earn points. Without cleaning, no apples can appear.  

Final action: **clean**.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Agent 3 at (5,0).
  Thinking: At (7,1), I am not currently on a cell with an apple, and there's no indication of dirt to clean. Agent 3 is at (5,0), which is off my current position and likely not relevant unless there's a rule about interference or competition — but none is given.

Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first assess whether there's dirt nearby to clean.

However, no dirt or apple is mentioned in the current state. Therefore, I cannot eat an apple, and I have no dirt to clean.

**Best action: stay**  
Reason: I need to assess the environment first. Without knowing if there's dirt or apples nearby, moving might lead to wasted steps. Staying allows me to observe or wait for a better opportunity. If dirt is present, I can clean it. If apples appear after cleaning, I can eat them.  

✅ Action: stay

  Obs: You at (7,5). Dirt at (7,6), (8,4).
  Thinking: At (7,5), you are not on any dirt, so you cannot clean. There is no apple visible at your position.  

Dirt is at (7,6) and (8,4) — both are not adjacent to you. You can only clean dirt if you are on the same cell.  

Since there are no apples at (7,5), and you can't clean dirt from a distance, you cannot eat an apple.  

**Best action: stay**  
Reason: Staying allows you to monitor the situation. If you move to (7,6) later, you can clean the dirt there, which may eventually lead to apple spawning (since apples only appear when the river is clean). But currently, no action yields immediate benefit.  

→ **Stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Dirt at (6,0), (8,0).
  Thinking: At (6,0): There is dirt here, so I can clean it. Cleaning dirt gives no points, but it's necessary to enable apple spawning.  

Currently, apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Since there's dirt at (6,0) and (8,0), the area is not clean yet.  

Action: **clean**  
Reason: I must clean the dirt at (6,0) to progress toward a clean river and eventually spawn apples. After cleaning, I can assess whether to move to (8,0) to clean that as well.  

Next step: After cleaning (6,0), I can move to (8,0) to clean it too. Then, the river will be clean, and apples may spawn on land.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,6). Agent 2 at (8,6).
  Thinking: At (7,6), I am adjacent to Agent 2 at (8,6). There's no information about dirt or apples currently in my cell. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when there's less dirt), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first assess whether there's dirt to clean or an apple to eat.

No apple or dirt is mentioned, so I cannot eat or clean yet. Without knowing the state of the current cell (dirt or apple), I cannot take action.

**Best action: stay** — to monitor the situation and wait for more information about the environment (e.g., dirt or apple presence) before deciding to clean or eat.

**Reasoning**: I cannot eat an apple or clean dirt without knowing what's in my current cell. Staying allows me to observe and respond appropriately.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,6). Agent 1 at (7,6).
  Thinking: At (8,6), I am currently on a cell. Agent 1 is at (7,6), directly to the left.  

There is no information about dirt or apples in this cell, so I must assess:  
- If there’s dirt, I can clean it (but cleaning gives 0 points).  
- If there’s an apple, I can eat it (+1.0).  

Since no apple or dirt is mentioned, and I don’t know the state of the current cell, I should **stay** to assess the situation. Moving without knowing the environment could lead to missing an apple or wasting a turn.  

**Action: stay**.  

(Reasoning: Without knowing if there's dirt or an apple at (8,6), I cannot safely clean or eat. Staying allows observation of the current cell’s state.)
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Dirt at (8,0).
  Thinking: You are at (6,0). Dirt is at (8,0).  

To clean dirt, you must be on the same cell as the dirt. You are not on (8,0), so you cannot clean it directly.  

Action options:  
- Move to (8,0) to clean the dirt.  
- Stay at (6,0) — no apple or dirt to act on.  

Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and you can't clean dirt from where you are, **you must move to (8,0)** to clean it.  

**Best action: right** (to move to (8,0)) → then clean.  

After cleaning, the river becomes clean, which may allow apples to spawn (though not guaranteed without more info). Then you can eat apples if they appear.

Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when there's less dirt), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first assess whether there's dirt to clean.  

No dirt or apple status is given, so I cannot eat yet.  

**Best action: stay** — to monitor the situation. If dirt is present, I can clean it. If apples appear after cleaning, I can eat them. Moving (up, down, left, right) without knowing the environment could lead to missing opportunities.  

**Reasoning:** Without knowing the current state of dirt or apples, and since eating requires an apple (which depends on cleanliness), I should not act prematurely. Staying allows me to observe and act only when necessary.

Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points, I must first determine if there's dirt on my current cell.

No information is given about dirt at (8,6). So, I cannot assume dirt is present.

**Action:**  
I should **stay** at (8,6) to assess the situation — perhaps dirt is present, or apples might spawn if cleaned. Without knowing the state of the cell, I cannot safely clean or eat.

You cannot clean dirt unless you are on the same cell as the dirt. Since you are at (7,0) and the dirt is at (8,0), you must move to (8,0) to clean it.  

Cleaning dirt does not give points, but it enables apples to spawn on land (i.e., cleaner areas). After cleaning, if apples spawn, you can then eat them for +1.0 points each.  

**Action: right** (to move to (8,0))  
Then: **clean** (to remove dirt)  
After that, check if apples spawn — if so, you can eat them.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,6). Agent 2 at (8,6).
  Thinking: At (7,6), I am adjacent to Agent 2 at (8,6). There's no mention of dirt or apples currently, so I need to assess the situation.

Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when there's less dirt), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first determine if there's dirt to clean.

No dirt or apple is mentioned, so I assume the current state is unknown. However, to enable apple spawning, I must clean dirt if present.

**Action: stay**  
Reasoning: I cannot eat an apple without knowing it's present. Since I don’t know if there’s dirt or an apple at (7,6), and I can only act on what’s directly at my position, I should first check or clean if needed. But with no info, safest is to **stay** and assess — perhaps the river is clean already, and apples may spawn. If dirt is present, I’ll clean it. If not, I can eat if an apple is there.

But since no apple or dirt is stated, and I’m at (7,6), I cannot assume anything. Therefore, **stay** is the safest initial move.

Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,6). Agent 1 at (7,6).
  Thinking: At (8,6), I am currently on a cell. There's no mention of dirt or an apple in this location, and Agent 1 is at (7,6), which is adjacent but not directly relevant unless there's interaction.  

Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points, I must first assess whether there's dirt to clean. There's no indication of dirt at (8,6) currently.  

If there's no dirt, I cannot clean. If there's no apple, I cannot eat.  

**Action: stay**  
Reason: Without knowing if there's dirt or an apple at (8,6), I cannot safely perform clean or eat. Staying allows me to assess the situation further. If dirt is present later, I can clean it. If an apple appears (only when river is clean), I can eat it.

  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (8,0). Agent 1 at (7,1) Agent 2 at (7,2).
  Thinking: At (8,1), there is dirt at (8,0) directly below you. You can only clean dirt if you are on the same cell as it. Since you are at (8,1) and the dirt is at (8,0), you cannot clean it directly.

To clean the dirt at (8,0), you must move to (8,0) first. However, moving down to (8,0) would place you on a cell with dirt — but cleaning only occurs if you are on the dirt cell. So:

- **Action: move down to (8,0)** → now you are on dirt.
- **Action: clean** → removes dirt (no points, but necessary for apple spawning).

After cleaning, if the river becomes clean (dirt reduced), apples may spawn on land. But currently, there's no apple mentioned, and apples only spawn when the river is clean — which depends on dirt levels.

Currently, the only dirt is at (8,0), which you can clean.

**Best action: move down to (8,0) and clean.**

→ This enables potential apple spawning later when the river is clean.

  Thinking: At (8,1), you are adjacent to dirt at (8,0) — which is directly below you. Agent 3 is also at (8,0), so that cell is occupied.

**Analysis:**
- You can only clean dirt **if you are on the same cell** as the dirt. So, you can clean the dirt at (8,0) only if you move there.
- Agent 3 is currently at (8,0), so unless Agent 3 moves, you cannot access that dirt.
- The dirt at (6,0) is far away and not reachable directly.
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. But cleaning dirt gives **no points**, only enables apple spawning.
- You can only eat apples if you are on a cell with an apple — which depends on clean land.

**Current situation:**
- You are at (8,1). No apple visible.
- Dirt at (8,0) — can only be cleaned if you move there and Agent 3 leaves or moves.
- Agent 3 is at (8,0), so you cannot clean it unless they move.

**Best action:**
→ **Move down to (8,0
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Agent 1 at (8,1).
  Thinking: At (7,2), I am not on a cell with an apple, and there's no information about dirt or apple spawn conditions directly. However, apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt). Since I can only clean dirt or eat apples *at my current position*, and I don't currently have an apple, I must first consider whether the cell at (7,2) has dirt.

But there's no indication of dirt or apples in the current state. Agent 1 is at (8,1), which may imply proximity to a river or dirt zone, but that doesn't directly affect me unless I can move toward it.

**Action: stay**  
Reasoning: Without knowing whether (7,2) has dirt or an apple, I cannot safely clean or eat. Moving might expose me to unknown terrain. Staying is safe and allows me to assess the situation. If dirt is present, I can clean later; if an apple is present, I can eat it. Since no apple or dirt is mentioned, staying is the most cautious and rational choice.  

→ **Action: stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Dirt at (6,0), (8,0). Agent 1 at (8,1).
  Thinking: At (8,0), you see dirt at (6,0) and (8,0). You are currently on a cell with dirt, so you can **clean** it. However, cleaning dirt gives no points, but it's necessary to make apples spawn on land.  

There is no apple currently visible, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed from land cells). Since dirt is present at (6,0) and (8,0), and you're at (8,0), cleaning (8,0) will help clean that cell.  

Agent 1 is at (8,1), which is above you — not relevant unless there's interaction, but no rules mention agent interference.  

**Best action:**  
→ **clean** (to remove dirt at (8,0))  

This makes the land cleaner, potentially enabling apple spawning in the future. You can’t eat yet because no apple is present.  

**Next step:** After cleaning, check if apples appear (though not visible now), and consider moving to other cells to explore or clean more dirt.

--- Step 37 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (6,0). Agent 2 at (7,2) Agent 3 at (8,0).
  Thinking: At (8,1), you are not on dirt, so you can't clean. There's dirt at (6,0), which is far away — you can't reach it directly without moving. Agent 2 is at (7,2), Agent 3 at (8,0). 

Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned). Since dirt is at (6,0), and you're at (8,1), you need to move to (6,0) to clean it. But you can only clean dirt when you are on the cell with dirt.

Current options:
- Move to (6,0) to clean dirt → this will make the river cleaner, enabling apples to spawn (but no points from cleaning).
- After cleaning, apples may spawn — but only if they appear on land (which depends on river cleanliness).
- Then, you can move to land cells near the river to eat apples (+1.0 each).

But currently, there are no apples visible, and you're not on dirt.

Best first move: **left** to (7,1), then **left** to (6,1), then **up/down** to approach (6,0). But since (6
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Agent 1 at (8,1).
  Thinking: At (7,2), I am on land. There's no apple visible, and I need to assess whether I can clean dirt or eat an apple.

- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when there's less dirt).  
- Cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary to enable apple spawning.  
- I can only act on my current cell.

Right now, I don’t know if there’s dirt on my cell or if there are apples. Since I’m at (7,2), and Agent 1 is at (8,1), there’s no direct indication of dirt or apples nearby.

**Best action: clean**  
If there's dirt here, cleaning it helps make the river cleaner, which may eventually allow apples to spawn. Even though cleaning gives no points, it's a necessary step to enable apple spawning. Without cleaning, apples won’t appear.

→ **Action: clean**
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Dirt at (6,0). Agent 1 at (8,1).
  Thinking: At (8,0), there is no apple visible, and the only dirt is at (6,0), which is not adjacent to you. You are at (8,0), so you cannot clean (6,0) directly. To clean dirt, you must be on the same cell as the dirt.

Since you are not on (6,0), you cannot clean it. Also, no apple is present at your current position. Therefore:

- You cannot eat an apple (no apple at (8,0)).
- You cannot clean dirt (not on the dirt cell).

Best action: **move left to (7,0)** to get closer to the dirt at (6,0), then possibly clean it.

**Reasoning**: Apples only spawn when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt enables apple spawning. Since you are not on the dirt, you can't clean it. Moving toward the dirt allows you to eventually clean it, which may lead to apple spawning later. Eating now gives no points, so cleaning is the priority.

**Action: left**.

--- Step 38 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Dirt at (6,0). Agent 2 at (7,2) Agent 3 at (7,0).
  Thinking: At (7,1), you are not on any dirt, and there's dirt at (6,0), which is not adjacent to you. The apple spawning depends on the river being clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned to allow apples to spawn. Since you're not on dirt, you can't clean it directly.

Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, but currently, there's dirt at (6,0), and you're at (7,1). To clean dirt, you must be on the same cell as the dirt.

You cannot eat an apple because there is no apple visible at your position. You also cannot clean dirt at (6,0) from (7,1).

Best action: **move left to (6,1)** or **move down to (7,0)** to get closer to (6,0) or to check other positions.

But currently, you are not on dirt — so **clean is not possible**.

→ **Action: left** (to (6,1)) to get closer to (6,0) and possibly clean it next.

✅ Final action: **stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,5). Agent 1 at (8,4).
  Thinking: At (8,5), I am not on an apple (no apple mentioned), and there's no indication of dirt to clean. Agent 1 is at (8,4), which is directly above me. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points, I must first assess whether there's dirt to clean.

Currently, no dirt is mentioned, and I have no apple. Therefore:

- I cannot eat an apple (no apple at (8,5)).
- I cannot clean dirt (no dirt visible).

Best action: **stay** — to monitor the situation and wait for possible apple spawning or movement.

**Reasoning**: Without dirt to clean or an apple to eat, and with no information about surroundings, staying is the safest and most strategic choice. If dirt appears or apples spawn later, I can act accordingly.  

**Action: stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Dirt at (8,1), (6,0).
  Thinking: You are at (6,0).  
Dirt is at (6,0) and (8,1).  

Since you are on (6,0), which has dirt, you can **clean** it.  
Cleaning dirt does not give points, but it is necessary to enable apples to spawn — and apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt).  

Currently, there's dirt at (6,0) and (8,1). Cleaning (6,0) will reduce dirt at that location.  

**Action: clean**  
→ This will remove dirt from (6,0), making the cell clean.  
→ After cleaning, the river is cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn on land (but only if apples are available and on clean land).  

After cleaning, you can then consider moving to (8,1) to clean that dirt, or stay to potentially eat an apple if one has spawned.  

But: there's no apple mentioned. Apples only spawn *after* dirt is cleaned and the river is clean.  

So, immediate action: **clean** at (6,0).  

**Final action: clean** ✅

--- Step 9 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,4). Agent 2 at (8,5).
  Thinking: At (8,4), I am on land. Agent 2 is at (8,5), directly above me.  

To maximize points:  
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when there's less dirt).  
- Cleaning dirt gives no points, but is necessary to enable apple spawning.  
- I can only clean or eat what is directly at my position.  

Since I’m at (8,4), I must first determine if there’s dirt here. If there is dirt, I must clean it (no point gain, but required). If there’s no dirt, I can directly eat an apple if one is present.  

However, the current state doesn’t specify whether (8,4) has dirt or an apple. But since Agent 2 is at (8,5), and we’re told apples spawn when the river is clean, it’s likely the river is currently dirty, so apples aren’t spawning yet.  

**Best action**:  
→ **clean** (if dirt is present) to enable future apple spawning.  

If no dirt is present, then **eat** if an apple is there. But since no apple is mentioned, and the river is likely dirty, **clean** is
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,5). Agent 1 at (8,4).
  Thinking: At (8,5), there's no apple visible, and there's no indication of dirt to clean. Agent 1 is at (8,4), which is directly above you. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, we must first assess whether there's dirt to clean here.

Currently, no dirt is mentioned at (8,5), so we cannot clean anything. Also, no apple is present. Therefore, we cannot eat.

**Best action: stay**  
Reason: There's no dirt to clean, no apple to eat, and moving might lead to an unproductive path. Staying allows us to monitor the situation or wait for a possible apple spawn if the environment changes.  

→ **Action: stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Dirt at (8,1).
  Thinking: At (6,0), you are not on dirt, so you can't clean it directly. Dirt is at (8,1), which is not adjacent to your current position. To clean dirt, you must move to the cell with dirt.  

Action: **right** to (7,0), then **right** to (8,0), then **down** to (8,1) to clean the dirt.  

After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner, which increases apple spawning potential. But note: cleaning gives no points. Only eating apples gives +1.0 points.  

So, first priority: **move to (8,1)** to clean dirt.  

**Action: right → down** (to reach (8,1)) → then **clean**.  

Once cleaned, if apples spawn (which depends on overall river cleanliness), you may later eat them. But currently, no apple is visible.  

**Next step: clean the dirt at (8,1).**  

✅ Action: **right, down, clean**.  

(No eating possible yet — no apple at current location.)

--- Step 10 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,4). Agent 2 at (8,5).
  Thinking: At (8,4), I am on land. Agent 2 is at (8,5), directly above me.  

First, check if there's an apple here: no information says there is one. So, I cannot eat yet.  

To spawn apples, the river must be clean — but I don’t have info about the river’s state. However, apples only spawn *on land when the river is clean*. Since I don’t know the river’s condition, I can’t assume apples are available.  

But: cleaning dirt gives no points, only enables apple spawning. So, if I’m on dirt, I must clean it. But I’m at (8,4) — is this dirt or land? The problem says "you are at (8,4)" — no indication of dirt/land. But since apples spawn *on land*, and I’m on land, maybe I’m already on land.  

No dirt mentioned at (8,4), so likely it's land. Therefore, no need to clean.  

But to get apples, the river must be clean. Since I don’t know the river’s state, and I can’t affect it directly, I must assume the river is not clean unless cleaned.  

So:
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,5). Agent 1 at (8,4).
  Thinking: At (8,5), there's no apple visible, and the cell is not explicitly stated to have dirt. Agent 1 is at (8,4), which is directly above you. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points, we must first assess whether there's dirt to clean.

Currently, no dirt is mentioned at (8,5), so we cannot clean anything here. Also, there's no indication of an apple at (8,5). Therefore:

- **Cannot eat** (no apple present).
- **Cannot clean** (no dirt indicated).

Best action: **stay** — to monitor the situation and possibly wait for a clean river condition or for an apple to spawn. Moving would be risky without information about surroundings.

👉 **Action: stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Dirt at (8,1).
  Thinking: You are at (7,0). Dirt is at (8,1).  

To clean dirt, you must be on the same cell as the dirt. You are not currently on (8,1), so you cannot clean it yet.  

Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. Since dirt is at (8,1), you need to move there first.  

**Action: right** (to move to (8,0)), then **right** again to reach (8,1).  

Once at (8,1), you can **clean** the dirt. Cleaning it will help make land available for apples to spawn.  

After cleaning, you can return to (7,0) or explore further.  

**Next step: move right → right → clean**  

→ **Reasoning**: You must reach the dirt cell to clean it. Without cleaning, no apples can spawn. Cleaning dirt enables apple spawning, even though it gives no points directly.  

**Action: right** (to (8,0)) → **right** (to (8,1)) → **clean**.
   This is a strategic long-term move. Cleaning dirt at (6,1) would improve the river's
  Decision: {'action': 'clean_at', 'args': {'coord_x': 6, 'coord_y': 1}} -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 3 (High-Level):
  Obs: You are at (6, 8). You see agent 1 at (6, 7), dirt at (8, 7) and dirt at (6, 8).
  Thinking: I am at (6, 8), and I observe that there is dirt directly at my current position — (6, 8). This dirt is the nearest dirt globally, with a distance of 0. That means I am already standing on dirt, which is a key element in the game's mechanics: apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning less dirt. Therefore, cleaning this dirt is essential to enable future apple spawning.

Right now, the nearest apple is at (1, 8), which is 5 steps away. However, there is no apple visible or implied to be present at my current location — in fact, since there's dirt here, no apple can spawn yet. Eating an apple would require one to be present, and none are currently visible or accessible without first cleaning the dirt.

So, the immediate reward (eating an apple) is not available — no apple is present at (6, 8) or nearby, because dirt blocks apple spawning. Therefore, **option 1 (eating an apple) is not viable**.

Option 2 — cleaning dirt to enable future apple spawning — is directly relevant. Cleaning the dirt at (6, 8) would reduce the total dirt in the environment, potentially allowing apples to

--- Step 1 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,5). Dirt at (7,6), (7,4).
  Thinking: At (5,5), I am not on any dirt, so I cannot clean. There are no apples currently spawning because dirt is present and the river is not clean. To enable apple spawning, I must clean the dirt at (7,6) and (7,4), but I can only clean when I am on a cell with dirt.

I need to move to one of those dirt cells to clean them. The closest dirt is at (7,6) — I can go right to (6,6), then down to (7,6). From there, I can clean (7,6), which reduces dirt and improves river cleanliness. After that, I can move to (7,4) and clean it.

Cleaning dirt gives no points, but enables apple spawning. Once the river is clean (no dirt), apples may spawn on land — and I can eat them for +1.0 each.

**Action plan:**  
1. Move right to (6,6)  
2. Move down to (7,6)  
3. Clean (7,6)  
4. Move left to (7,5)  
5. Move down to (8,5) — or directly to (7,4) via left to
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (9,7). Dirt at (7,8), (7,6).
  Thinking: At (9,7), you are not on any dirt, so you cannot clean. There are no apples visible at your position. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), but since you can't clean dirt from (7,8) or (7,6) from (9,7), you can't directly affect apple spawning.

**Action: stay**  
Reasoning: You can't clean dirt or eat an apple from your current position. Moving would not help without a path to dirt. Staying is safe and avoids wasted moves. Apple spawning depends on cleaning dirt elsewhere, which you can't do from here. No immediate benefit to move.  

**Final action: stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (9,0). Dirt at (8,1), (8,0).
  Thinking: At (9,0), you are adjacent to dirt at (8,0) — directly to the left. The dirt at (8,1) is above that, not directly adjacent.

You can only clean dirt if you are on the same cell. So:

- You are at (9,0). Dirt is at (8,0) and (8,1). You are not on either of those cells.
- Therefore, you **cannot clean** any dirt right now.
- There are no apples mentioned, so no apples to eat.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: You cannot clean dirt or eat apples from your current position. Staying is safe and allows you to move strategically later when you can reach dirt cells.  

→ **Action: stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,0). Agent 1 at (7,1).
  Thinking: At (5,0), I am not on land with apples yet. The river is currently dirty, so apples aren't spawning. To get apples, I must first clean dirt to make the river clean — but cleaning gives no points.  

I need to assess:  
- Is there dirt at (5,0)? If yes, I can clean it.  
- After cleaning, if the river becomes clean, apples may spawn.  
- I must stay on land to eat apples.  

Since I’m at (5,0) and Agent 1 is at (7,1), there’s no immediate threat or apple spawn mentioned.  

**Action: clean**  
→ Cleaning dirt at (5,0) will make the river cleaner (if dirt exists), enabling future apple spawning. Even though cleaning gives 0 points, it's necessary.  

**Reasoning**: Without cleaning, no apples can spawn. I must first clean to enable apple access. Then I can move to areas with apples.  

**Next step**: After cleaning, check if apples now spawn — if so, move to eat them.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Agent 3 at (5,0).
  Thinking: At (7,1), I am not directly adjacent to Agent 3 at (5,0), so there's no immediate threat or interaction.  

To maximize points:  
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt).  
- Cleaning dirt gives no points, but is necessary to enable apple spawning.  
- I can only eat apples or clean dirt from my current position.  

Since I’m at (7,1), I should first check if there’s dirt here. If there is, I must clean it (no points, but needed). If there’s an apple, I can eat it (+1.0).  

No information about dirt or apples at (7,1) is given. So, **action: clean** (if dirt exists) or **eat** (if apple exists).  

But since we don’t know the state of the cell, safest first step: **clean** — to enable future apple spawning.  

✅ Reasoning: Cleaning is necessary to allow apples to spawn. Without it, no apples can appear. I must act now to prepare for future apple gains.  

**Action: clean**.
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Dirt at (7,6), (8,4).
  Thinking: At (7,5), I see dirt at (7,6) and (8,4). I cannot eat an apple because there's no apple visible, and apples only spawn when the river is clean — which depends on removing dirt.

I can only clean dirt **if I am on the same cell** as the dirt. Since I'm at (7,5), I can only clean dirt at (7,6) if I move there. Currently, I'm not on (7,6) or (8,4).

So, best action: **move right to (7,6)** to clean the dirt there.

After cleaning (7,6), the river becomes cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn — but I can't eat until an apple appears.

**Action: right** (to move to (7,6))  
Then, if on (7,6), **clean**.  

This is necessary to enable future apple spawning.  

✅ Reasoning: Cleaning dirt is required to enable apples, and I must be on the dirt cell to clean it. I can't eat yet, so prioritize cleaning.
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,0). Agent 1 at (7,1).
  Thinking: At (5,0), I am not on a cell with an apple (apples only spawn when the river is clean, which depends on dirt levels). There's no indication of dirt here, so I can't clean or eat yet. Agent 1 is at (7,1), which is irrelevant unless there's a rule about interference or competition — but none is stated.

Action: **stay**  
Reason: No apples are visible, and I don't have dirt to clean. Moving may not help without more info. Best to stay and assess.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Agent 3 at (5,0).
  Thinking: At (7,1), I am not currently on land with apples—apples only spawn when the river is clean, which depends on dirt being cleaned. Since I am at (7,1), I need to assess whether there's dirt to clean or an apple to eat.

Agent 3 is at (5,0), which is far away—so no direct interference. I must first determine if there's dirt at my current position. If there is dirt, I can clean it (no points, but necessary for apples). If there's an apple, I can eat it (+1.0 point). 

But currently, no info about dirt or apples at (7,1). So, I should **check my surroundings** to see if I can clean dirt or find an apple.

Best action: **clean** (if dirt is present) to enable future apple spawning.  

→ **Action: clean**  

Reasoning: Without cleaning dirt, apples won’t spawn. Cleaning is necessary groundwork, even though it gives no points. This enables future apple spawns and increases potential points.
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,5). Dirt at (7,6), (8,4).
  Thinking: At (8,5), you are not on any dirt, so you can't clean. There's dirt at (7,6) and (8,4), but you can only clean if you're on a cell with dirt.  

Currently, no apples are spawning because the river is not clean (dirt exists). To enable apple spawning, you must clean the dirt.  

You can move to (8,4) or (7,6) to clean them.  

- To clean (8,4): move left to (8,4) → clean → removes dirt.  
- To clean (7,6): move up-left to (7,6) → clean → removes dirt.  

After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner → apples may spawn on land.  

Best move: **move left to (8,4)** and clean it.  

**Action: left, then clean**.  

After that, you can check for apples and eat them if available.  

✅ Reasoning: Cleaning dirt is necessary to spawn apples. You must act on dirt you're on. Moving to (8,4) is closest and allows immediate cleaning.
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,0). Agent 1 at (7,1).
  Thinking: At (5,0), I am not on land with apples currently — there's no indication of an apple spawn. The river is likely dirty, so apples aren't spawning yet. To enable apple spawning, I need to clean dirt. But I can only clean dirt *on my current cell*.  

I must first check if (5,0) has dirt. Since no info says it does, assume it might. To be safe, I should **clean** if dirt is present. If not, I can't spawn apples.  

But since I have no apple to eat and no info about dirt at (5,0), the best move is to **clean** to improve the river’s cleanliness and enable future apple spawning.  

**Action: clean**.  

(Reasoning: Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning, even though it gives no points. Without cleaning, apples won’t appear. I must act proactively to maximize future apple intake.)

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Agent 3 at (5,0).
  Thinking: At (7,1), I am not on a cell with an apple, and there's no indication of dirt to clean. Agent 3 is at (5,0), which is far away and not relevant to my current position.  

Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points, I must first consider whether there's dirt at (7,1). If there is dirt, I can clean it to enable possible apple spawning. If not, apples may not be available.  

No apple is visible at (7,1), so I cannot eat.  

**Best action: stay** — to monitor the situation. If dirt is present, I can clean it later. Without confirmation of dirt or apple presence, no immediate benefit from moving or eating.  

**Reasoning:** Cleaning dirt is necessary but gives no points; eating apples only gives points if they are present. Since no apple is visible and no dirt is confirmed, staying is safest and most strategic.  

**Final action: stay** ✅
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Dirt at (8,0).
  Thinking: You are at (8,0), and there is dirt at your position.  

Action: **clean**  
Reason: You can only gain apples when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is removed). Since you're on dirt, cleaning it is necessary to enable apple spawning. Cleaning gives no points directly, but it's required to allow apples to spawn later.  

→ Do **clean**.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,6). Agent 2 at (8,6).
  Thinking: At (7,6), I am adjacent to Agent 2 at (8,6). There's no information about dirt or apples currently, so I must assess:

- I can only clean dirt or eat apples **on my current cell**.
- Apples spawn only when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is reduced), so cleaning dirt is necessary but gives no points.
- Eating apples gives +1.0 points, but only if apples are present.

Since there's no indication of dirt or apples at (7,6), and I don’t know the state of the river or terrain, **I should first check if there's dirt to clean**.

But: **No dirt is mentioned**, so I assume the cell may be clean or empty.

Best action: **Stay** — to assess the situation further. If there's dirt, I can clean it (no points), which may enable apples to spawn. If there's an apple, I can eat it.

→ **Stay** (to remain in position and evaluate whether to clean or eat next).  

**Reasoning**: Without knowing if dirt or apples are present, moving or acting prematurely risks missing opportunities. Staying allows safe assessment of the current cell state.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,6). Agent 1 at (7,6).
  Thinking: At (8,6), I am currently on a cell. Agent 1 is at (7,6), directly to my left.  

To maximize points:  
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned).  
- Cleaning dirt gives no points, but is necessary to enable apple spawning.  
- I can only eat or clean from my current position.  

No information is given about dirt status or apple presence at (8,6). Since apples only appear when the river is clean, and I don’t know if there’s dirt here or if cleaning is needed, I should first assess whether I need to clean.  

But since I’m at (8,6) and no dirt or apple is mentioned, and I can’t act on cells beyond my position, the safest and most logical first step is to **check if there’s dirt to clean**.  

However, no dirt is mentioned. So, if there’s no dirt, I can’t clean. If there’s no apple, I can’t eat.  

But since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and I don’t know the state of the river, I must assume that cleaning is required to enable apple spawning.  

Therefore, if
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first check if there's dirt to clean. Without sight of any objects, you cannot confirm whether dirt is present.

Action: **stay**  
Reasoning: Staying allows you to assess the situation without moving. If dirt is present, you can clean it later. Without visibility, moving could lead to missing a valuable opportunity or wasting actions. Stay to evaluate the environment before acting.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,6). Agent 2 at (8,6).
  Thinking: At (7,6), I am adjacent to Agent 2 at (8,6). There's no information about dirt or apples currently in this area. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when there's less dirt), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first assess whether there's dirt to clean.

However, no dirt or apple status is provided. Without knowing if there's dirt at (7,6), I cannot perform a clean action. Also, I cannot eat an apple unless one is present.

**Best action: stay**  
Reason: I need to gather more information about the state of the current cell (dirt or apple). Moving might expose me to new situations, but without knowing the environment, staying is safe and allows for potential future actions. If dirt is present, I can clean it to enable apple spawning. If an apple is already there, I can eat it. Since nothing is known, staying is the most cautious and strategic choice.  

**Action: stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,6). Agent 1 at (7,6).
  Thinking: At (8,6), I am currently on a cell. Agent 1 is at (7,6), directly to my left. There's no mention of dirt or apples in the current state, so I need to assess what I can do.

Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first consider whether there's dirt to clean. However, no dirt is mentioned, so I cannot assume there is.

If there's no dirt, then cleaning is not needed. If there's no apple, I cannot eat.

Given the lack of information about dirt or apples, and since I am not told I can see or detect anything, the safest action is to **stay** at (8,6) to monitor the situation or wait for more information.

**Action: stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apples to spawn, the river must be clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. However, cleaning dirt gives no points, only enables apple spawning.

Since you're at (8,0) and see nothing, it's likely your current cell is either clean or empty. Without any visible dirt or apples, there's no immediate action that gains points.

**Best action: stay**  
Reason: You cannot eat (no apple), and cleaning is not beneficial unless dirt is present. Since nothing is visible, staying is safe and allows you to assess the environment. If dirt appears later, you can act.  

→ **stay**

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,6). Agent 2 at (8,6).
  Thinking: At (7,6), I am adjacent to Agent 2 at (8,6). There's no mention of dirt or apples currently, so I need to assess the situation:

- I can only clean dirt or eat apples **on my current cell**.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is removed), but cleaning dirt gives **no points**.
- To maximize points, I must first **clean dirt** (if present) to enable apple spawning, then **eat apples**.

Since there's no info about dirt or apples at (7,6), I should first **check if there's dirt**. But since no dirt is mentioned, and no apples are visible, I must assume the initial state is neutral.

**Action: clean**  
→ This ensures the river (if adjacent) becomes clean, enabling apple spawning in the future. Even though cleaning gives no points, it's necessary for apples to appear.

**Reasoning:** Without cleaning, apples won’t spawn. Since I can only act on my current cell, and I need to enable apple spawning to gain points, cleaning is the necessary first step.  

→ **Action: clean**
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,6). Agent 1 at (7,6).
  Thinking: At (8,6), I am currently on a cell. Agent 1 is at (7,6), directly to my left.  

There is no information about dirt or apples in this location yet. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first assess whether there's dirt here.  

If there's dirt at (8,6), I can clean it — but that doesn't give points. If there's no dirt, I can't clean, and apples won't spawn.  

Since I don't have visibility of the dirt state or apple presence, and no apples are mentioned, I should **stay** at (8,6) to monitor the situation.  

**Action: stay**  
But let's check: from (6,5), go **right to (7,5)** → not dirt. Then **right to (8,5)** → now on
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,7). Dirt at (6,8), (7,8), (7,6).
  Thinking: At (8,7), you are not on any dirt cells. Dirt is at (6,8), (7,8), (7,6) — all of which are outside your current position.

To eat apples, the river must be clean (i.e., dirt must be removed), and apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Since you're not on any dirt, you can't clean it directly.

**Action:** Stay.  
**Reasoning:** You cannot clean dirt or eat apples from your current position. To progress, you must move to a dirt cell to clean it. Moving to (7,8) or (7,6) would allow cleaning. However, since the goal is to maximize points and apples only spawn after cleaning, **cleaning dirt is necessary first**.  

Best next step: **Move to (7,8)** to clean it. Then continue cleaning adjacent dirt to clean the river and enable apple spawning.  

→ **Action: left** (to (7,7)) → then **down** or **up** to reach (7,8) or (7,6).

Agent 3 (Low-Level):

  Thinking: At (8,1), you are currently on a cell with dirt.  
Dirt is also at (7,2) and (6,0), but you can only clean dirt if you are on the same cell.

**Available actions:**
- You can **clean** the dirt at (8,1) — this will remove it and contribute to a cleaner river (enabling apple spawning).
- You cannot eat an apple yet because no apple is mentioned — apples only spawn when the river is clean, and currently, dirt exists at (8,1), (7,2), and (6,0), so the river is not clean.

**Reasoning:**  
Cleaning dirt at (8,1) is necessary to reduce dirt and make the river cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn later. Since eating apples gives +1.0 points and cleaning gives no points, but is essential for enabling apple spawning, you should **clean** the dirt at (8,1) first.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Dirt at (7,6), (8,5), (7,4).
  Thinking: At (7,5), you see dirt at (7,6), (8,5), and (7,4). You cannot eat apples yet because there are no apples present—apples only spawn when the river is clean, which requires cleaning dirt. Since you're at (7,5), you can only clean dirt that is in your immediate cell.

- (7,6) is directly above you → not accessible.
- (8,5) is to the right → not accessible.
- (7,4) is below you → not accessible.

You are not on any of the dirt cells. Therefore, you **cannot clean any dirt** right now.

No apples are present either, so you **cannot eat**.

Best action: **stay** — to wait for a chance to move to a dirt cell and clean it.

**Action: stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,7). Dirt at (6,8), (7,8), (7,6).
  Thinking: At (7,7), I see dirt at (6,8), (7,8), and (7,6). I am not on any dirt cells, so I cannot clean them directly. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning I need to clean dirt to enable apple spawning.

Since I can only clean dirt **when I am on a cell with dirt**, I must move to one of the dirt cells to clean them.

Available dirt cells:
- (6,8): can move up-left to reach
- (7,8): directly above (7,7) → move up
- (7,6): directly below (7,7) → move down

Best first step: Move to (7,8) or (7,6) to clean dirt.

But cleaning dirt gives no points — only enables apples to spawn. After cleaning, if the river becomes clean, apples may appear on land.

Currently, no apples are visible, so I should prioritize cleaning to enable future apple spawns.

**Action: Move up to (7,8)**  
→ Now I'm on dirt at (7,8), can clean it.

**Reasoning**: Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning. I must clean dirt
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (7,2), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (8,1), you are not on any dirt, so you cannot clean. There's no apple visible at your current position.  

Dirt is at (7,2) and (6,0) — both are not adjacent to (8,1), so you can't reach them directly without moving.  

To spawn apples, the river must be clean (i.e., dirt must be cleaned). But cleaning dirt gives no points — only eating apples does.  

So, to maximize points, you need to:  
1. Move to a dirt cell (e.g., (7,2) or (6,0)) to clean it.  
2. After cleaning, the area becomes clean, possibly enabling apple spawning.  

But since apples only spawn *when the river is clean*, and you can only eat apples when you're on a land cell with an apple, you must first clean dirt to enable apples.  

**Best action: move to (7,2)** — it's adjacent and has dirt. Clean it.  

After cleaning, if the river is now clean, apples might spawn. Then you can move to a land cell with an apple to eat it.  

→ **Action: left** (to move to (7,

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Dirt at (7,6), (8,6), (8,5), (7,4).
  Thinking: At (7,5), I see dirt at (7,6), (8,6), (8,5), and (7,4). I am not on any dirt, so I cannot clean yet. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning I need to clean dirt to enable apple spawning.

Since I can only clean dirt *on my current cell*, and I'm at (7,5), which has no dirt, I cannot clean anything here. The dirt is at (7,6), (8,6), (8,5), (7,4) — all adjacent or nearby, but not on my current cell.

Therefore, I must **move** to a cell with dirt to clean it.

Best move: **down to (8,5)** — this cell has dirt. Cleaning it will help clean the river and possibly allow apples to spawn later.

**Action: down**  
Reason: I need to reach a dirt cell to clean it. Moving down to (8,5) allows me to clean dirt and progress toward a clean river (which enables apple spawning).
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,7). Dirt at (6,8), (7,8), (7,6), (8,6).
  Thinking: At (7,7), I see dirt at (6,8), (7,8), (7,6), and (8,6). I am not on any dirt, so I cannot clean it directly. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning I need to clean the dirt to enable apple spawning.

However, I can only clean dirt if I am on the same cell as the dirt. Since I'm at (7,7), and the dirt is at (6,8), (7,8), (7,6), (8,6), I am not adjacent to any of them in a way that allows me to clean them directly.

Wait — I am at (7,7). Let's check adjacency:

- (6,8): diagonally up-left — not adjacent
- (7,8): directly up — adjacent
- (7,6): directly down — adjacent
- (8,6): diagonally down-left — not adjacent

So I can move to (7,8) or (7,6) to clean dirt.

But cleaning dirt gives no points — it's just necessary to enable apples. Apples only spawn *after* dirt is cleaned, and only on land cells
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Dirt at (7,2), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (7,1), you are not on any dirt, so you cannot clean. There's no apple visible at your position.  

Dirt is at (7,2) and (6,0), both of which are not adjacent to you. You must move to those cells to clean them.  

But cleaning dirt gives no points — only eating apples gives +1.0 points. Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed).  

So:  
- To get apples, the river must be clean → clean dirt.  
- But cleaning dirt doesn't give points.  
- You can only eat apples when you're on a cell with one.  

Right now, no apple is at (7,1). Dirt at (7,2) and (6,0) must be cleaned to allow apples to spawn (if they're on land near the river).  

Best action: **move to (7,2)** to clean it.  

After cleaning (7,2), if the river becomes clean, apples may spawn — but only if they appear on land. Since we don’t know the map layout beyond current info, we assume apples only appear on land when dirt is gone.  

**Reasoning**: You must reach the dirt cell to clean it. Without cleaning dirt, apples won’t spawn. So, move toward the dirt
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Agent 1 at (7,1).
  Thinking: At (7,2), I am not on a dirt cell, and there's no apple visible. Agent 1 is at (7,1), which is directly above me. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and I can only clean dirt at my current position, I need to check if there's dirt here.

Currently, no dirt is mentioned at (7,2), so I cannot clean anything. Also, no apple is indicated at (7,2). Therefore, I cannot eat.

Best action: **stay** — to monitor the situation or wait for a potential apple spawn (if dirt is cleaned nearby).  

**Reasoning**: Without dirt to clean, apples won’t spawn. Moving would risk missing opportunities. Staying allows me to assess if dirt appears or if an apple spawns later after cleaning.  

→ **Action: stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Dirt at (6,0). Agent 1 at (7,1).
  Thinking: At (7,0), there is dirt at (6,0) — which is adjacent to the left. Since you can only clean dirt if you're on the same cell, you cannot clean (6,0) from (7,0).  

There is no apple mentioned at your current position, so you cannot eat one yet.  

Agent 1 is at (7,1), but agents don’t affect your actions or points.  

**Best action: move left to (6,0)** to clean the dirt there.  

**Reasoning:**  
- Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning (even though cleaning gives no points).  
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be removed from river cells.  
- By cleaning (6,0), you enable potential apple spawning in that area (if it's a land cell).  
- Without cleaning, apples won’t spawn, and you can’t gain points.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,1). Dirt at (6,0). Agent 2 at (7,2) Agent 3 at (6,0).
  Thinking: You are at (6,1).  
Dirt is at (6,0) — directly below you.  
Agent 3 is also at (6,0), which means that cell is occupied.  

**Action Analysis:**  
- You **cannot clean dirt at (6,0)** because you're not on that cell, and Agent 3 is there.  
- You **cannot eat an apple** at (6,1) unless one spawns there — but apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned). Since dirt at (6,0) is not cleaned, no apples spawn.  
- You can **move** to adjacent cells to potentially access dirt or apples, but currently, no apple is available.  

**Best action:**  
→ **Down** to (6,0) to try to clean the dirt.  
But wait — Agent 3 is already there. Can you move there?  

Assuming agents occupy cells and cannot be displaced or shared, **you cannot move to (6,0)** because Agent 3 is there.  

Thus, you **cannot clean dirt** or **eat an apple**.  

**Conclusion:**  
You must **stay** at (6,1) —
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Agent 1 at (6,1).
  Thinking: At (7,2), I am on land. There's no apple visible, and I don't see any dirt to clean. Agent 1 is at (6,1), which is off my current position.  

Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is removed), and cleaning dirt gives no points but enables apple spawning, I must first assess whether I can reach dirt to clean.  

Currently, no dirt is mentioned, and no apple is present. Without dirt to clean, no apples can spawn.  

**Best action: stay** — I need to assess whether dirt is nearby. If no dirt is visible or accessible, I cannot clean or eat. Since I’m not at a dirt cell and no apple is present, I cannot gain points.  

→ **Action: stay** (to monitor the environment for dirt or apple spawns).
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Dirt at (6,0). Agent 1 at (6,1).
  Thinking: At (6,0), there is dirt, and you can clean it. Cleaning dirt gives no points, but it's necessary to enable apple spawning. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), cleaning the dirt at (6,0) will allow apples to potentially spawn on that cell or nearby.

However, there is no apple currently present. Eating is only possible if an apple is on the cell. Since we are currently on a dirt cell, we must first clean it.

**Action: clean**

After cleaning, the cell becomes land, which may allow apples to spawn (though spawning depends on river cleanliness globally, which isn't fully specified). But since no apple is present now, we cannot eat.

Next step: assess whether apples will spawn after cleaning. But based on current info, no apples exist. So, we must clean first.

**Final action: clean** ✅

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,1). Agent 2 at (7,2) Agent 3 at (6,0).
  Thinking: At (6,1), I am not on a dirt cell, and there's no visible apple. Agent 2 is at (7,2), Agent 3 at (6,0).  

To eat apples, I need to be on land where apples spawn — which requires the river to be clean (i.e., dirt cleaned). Since I can only clean dirt at my current position, I must first check if I’m on dirt.  

No information says I’m on dirt — so I cannot clean anything. If there's no dirt to clean, no apples can spawn.  

Thus, my best action is to **move** to a position where I can potentially clean dirt and enable apple spawning.  

Looking at positions:  
- (6,0) has Agent 3 — might be a dirt cell.  
- (7,2) has Agent 2 — possibly dirt too.  

But I can only act on my current cell.  

Since I’m at (6,1), I should **move** to a cell where dirt exists (to clean it) to enable apples.  

Best action: **right** to (7,1) — a likely candidate to explore or clean.  

But without knowing terrain, safest path: **move
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Agent 1 at (6,1).
  Thinking: At (7,2), I am on land. I need to assess whether there's an apple to eat or dirt to clean.  

- Agent 1 is at (6,1), which is off my current position.  
- There's no information about dirt or apples at (7,2) directly.  
- Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points, I must first determine if there's dirt here.  

**No dirt or apple is mentioned at (7,2)**. So:  
- I cannot eat an apple unless one is present.  
- I cannot clean dirt unless it's on my cell.  

→ **Action: stay**  
Reason: No apple or dirt is indicated. Staying is safe and allows monitoring. If dirt or apples appear later, I can act.  

**Final action: stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Agent 1 at (6,1).
  Thinking: At (6,0), you are on land. There's no dirt visible, and Agent 1 is at (6,1), directly above you. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when there's less dirt), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, we need to assess whether there's dirt to clean.

Currently, no dirt is mentioned at your position. So, you can't clean anything. Also, there's no apple mentioned at (6,0). Therefore, you cannot eat an apple.

**Action:** stay  
**Reasoning:** No dirt to clean, no apple to eat. Staying is safe and avoids unnecessary movement. If apples appear later when the river is clean, you’ll be in a good position. No benefit in moving yet.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,1). Agent 2 at (7,2) Agent 3 at (6,0).
  Thinking: At (5,1), I am not on any apple or dirt. Agent 2 is at (7,2), Agent 3 at (6,0). Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — so I need to clean dirt to enable apples to appear. Since I’m currently at (5,1), I must first check if there's dirt here.

But no dirt or apple is mentioned. So, to maximize points:

- If there's dirt at (5,1), I can clean it (gives no points, but enables apple spawning).
- If there's no dirt, I can only eat if an apple is present.

Since no apple or dirt is mentioned, and I have no information about surroundings, the safest move is to **clean** if dirt is present — but I don’t know.

Wait — I have no info on dirt at (5,1). So, I must assume I can’t eat unless an apple is there.

But apples only spawn when the river is clean. Since I’m at (5,1), and no dirt is mentioned, perhaps there is no dirt to clean.

Therefore, **no apple can spawn**, and I cannot eat.

But I must act.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,4). Agent 2 at (8,5).
  Thinking: At (8,4), I am not on a dirt cell, and there's no apple visible. Agent 2 is at (8,5), which is directly above me. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and I have no dirt to clean here, I can't spawn apples.

**Action: stay**  
Reasoning: I am not on dirt, so I can't clean. There's no apple to eat. Staying is safe and allows me to monitor the situation—perhaps Agent 2 is cleaning or has apples. No immediate gain, but no risk. Wait for a better opportunity.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,5). Agent 1 at (8,4).
  Thinking: At (8,5), there's no apple visible, and there's no indication of dirt to clean. Agent 1 is at (8,4), which is directly above you — but agents don't affect your actions or the environment unless specified.  

Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points, I must first determine if there's dirt at (8,5). There's no mention of dirt here.  

Thus:  
- No dirt → no cleaning action needed.  
- No apple → cannot eat.  

Best action: **stay** — to monitor the situation. If dirt appears or if the river is clean, apples might spawn. But currently, nothing actionable.  

**Action: stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Dirt at (8,1).
  Thinking: You are at (8,0). There is dirt at (8,1), which is directly above you.  

Since you can only clean dirt **if you are on the same cell**, you cannot clean the dirt at (8,1) from (8,0).  

Therefore, you must **move up to (8,1)** to clean the dirt.  

After cleaning, the river will be cleaner, which may enable apple spawning — but apples only appear on land when the river is clean. However, since there's no mention of apple locations, and you're only at (8,1) now, you must check if an apple is present.  

Currently, no apple is mentioned, so no eating is possible.  

**Action: up** → move to (8,1) to clean dirt.  

**Reasoning**: You must clean dirt to improve river cleanliness, which enables apples to spawn. You can't clean dirt from a distance. Moving up is necessary.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,4). Agent 2 at (8,5).
  Thinking: At (8,4), I am on land. Agent 2 is at (8,5), directly above me.  

To maximize points:  
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned).  
- Cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary to enable apple spawning.  
- I can only eat apples or clean dirt at my current position.  

Since there's no information about dirt at (8,4), I must assume it might be dirty. If it's dirty, I must clean it to enable apple spawning. But if it's already clean, I can eat an apple.  

No apple is mentioned, so likely no apple is present yet.  

**Action: clean**  
→ This ensures the river (at my position) becomes clean, allowing apples to spawn in the future.  

**Reasoning**: Without cleaning, no apples can spawn. Cleaning is a prerequisite for earning points. I cannot eat an apple if it doesn't exist. So, cleaning first is necessary.  

→ **Action: clean**
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,5). Agent 1 at (8,4).
  Thinking: At (8,5), there's no apple visible, and the cell is not explicitly stated to have dirt. Agent 1 is at (8,4), which is directly above. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, we must first assess whether dirt is present.

No dirt is mentioned at (8,5), so we cannot clean anything here. Also, there's no apple to eat.  

Best action: **stay** — to monitor the situation. If dirt appears or if we can move to a cell with dirt to clean, we can act later. But with no indication of dirt or apples at (8,5), staying is safest and most rational.

✅ Reasoning: No apple, no dirt to clean. Moving or cleaning would be pointless. Stay to assess environment.  

**Action: stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (7,2), (8,1).
  Thinking: At (8,1), you are on a cell with dirt. There's also dirt at (7,2).  

You can:
- **Clean** the dirt at (8,1) → this will make the river cleaner (helps apple spawning), but gives 0 points.
- **Eat** only if there's an apple — currently, no apple is mentioned, so cannot eat.
- Move to adjacent cells to potentially access more dirt or spawn apples, but apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt).

Since apples spawn only when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt is necessary, **cleaning the dirt at (8,1) is the best immediate action** to progress toward apple spawning.

**Action: clean**.  
This reduces dirt, improves river cleanliness, and enables future apple spawning. No points are gained from cleaning, but it's essential for enabling apple growth.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,4). Agent 2 at (8,5).
  Thinking: At (8,4), I am on land. Agent 2 is at (8,5), directly above me.  

To maximize points:  
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned).  
- Cleaning dirt gives no points, but is necessary to enable apples to spawn.  
- I can only eat apples or clean dirt from my current position.  

Currently, I don’t know if there’s dirt at (8,4), or if apples are present. Since apples spawn only when the river is clean, and I don’t have information about dirt status or apple presence, I must first assess whether I can clean dirt here.  

If there is dirt at (8,4), I can clean it (no points), which might enable apple spawning. If there’s no dirt, I can’t clean, and apples won’t spawn anyway.  

But without knowing the current dirt status, I can’t be sure.  

Best action: **clean** — if dirt is present, it enables future apple spawning. If not, it’s harmless.  

→ **Action: clean**
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,5). Agent 1 at (8,4).
  Thinking: At (8,5), I am not on an apple (no apple visible), and there's no indication of dirt to clean. Agent 1 is at (8,4), which is directly above me. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first assess whether there's dirt here.

Currently, no dirt is mentioned, and no apple is present at (8,5). Therefore, I cannot eat an apple.

Best action: **stay** — to monitor the situation. If dirt appears or if I can move to a position where dirt exists (e.g., below or beside), I can clean it to enable apple spawning. But with no immediate dirt or apple, staying is safe and strategic.

**Action: stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (7,2).
  Thinking: At (8,1), you are not on any dirt, so you cannot clean it. Dirt is at (7,2), which is not adjacent to your current position. Therefore, you cannot clean it directly.

There are no apples mentioned, and since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and we currently have no dirt cleaned, no apples are present.

Available actions:
- Move to adjacent cells to get closer to (7,2) to clean dirt.
- Stay — no benefit, as you can't clean or eat.

Best action: **left** to move to (7,1), closer to (7,2), to eventually clean the dirt.

**Reasoning**: To enable apple spawning, dirt must be cleaned. Since dirt is at (7,2), you must move there to clean it. Moving left to (7,1) is the first step toward that. No eating possible now.  

→ **Action: stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Dirt at (7,6), (8,4).
  Thinking: At (7,5), I see dirt at (7,6) and (8,4). I am not on any dirt, so I cannot clean yet. There are no apples mentioned, so I cannot eat.  

To enable apples to spawn, I must clean dirt. The only dirt I can reach directly is at (7,6) — I can move to (7,6) and clean it. (8,4) is not adjacent, so I can't reach it directly.  

**Action: move right to (7,6)**  
→ Clean dirt at (7,6) → This improves river cleanliness, enabling possible apple spawning.  

After cleaning, I can assess if apples now appear (though not explicitly stated), and then possibly move to eat.  

**Next step:** After cleaning, check for apples. If any spawn, I can eat them.  

**Final reasoning:** Clean adjacent dirt to enable apple spawning.  
→ **Action: right**
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,0). Agent 1 at (7,1).
  Thinking: At (5,0), I am not on land with an apple currently. The river is likely dirty (since no apples are mentioned), so apples aren't spawning. To enable apple spawning, I must first clean dirt if present.  

Since I am at (5,0), I need to check if there's dirt there. If there is, I can perform a **clean** action. If not, I might need to move to a dirt-covered cell to clean.  

However, no specific terrain is given. Given the rules:  
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean.  
- Cleaning dirt gives no points, but is necessary.  

Therefore, **my first action should be to clean any dirt at my current position (5,0)** if present.  

**Action: clean**  

This will help make the river cleaner, enabling future apple spawning. After cleaning, I can assess whether apples are now available and whether to move or eat.  

→ Reasoning: Clean first to enable apple spawning. Eating apples only gives points, but they won't spawn unless the river is clean.

--- Step 29 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Agent 3 at (5,0).
  Thinking: At (7,1), I am not currently on a cell with an apple, and I don’t know the river’s cleanliness or apple spawn status. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first assess whether I can clean dirt to improve the river’s condition and enable apple spawning.

Agent 3 is at (5,0), which is off to the left and down from me. There’s no direct indication of dirt or apple presence at (7,1). Without knowing if there’s dirt to clean or apples to eat, the best action is to **stay** and assess the situation further.

**Reasoning**: I cannot eat an apple without knowing it’s present. Cleaning dirt gives no points, but may enable future apple spawning. Since I don’t have information about dirt or apples at (7,1), I should not take a risky action. **Stay** is safest and allows for better situational awareness.

→ **Action: stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,5). Dirt at (7,6), (8,4).
  Thinking: At (8,5), you are not on any dirt, so you cannot clean. There is dirt at (7,6) and (8,4), but you can only clean if you are on a cell with dirt.

- You cannot eat an apple because there's no apple mentioned at your position.
- You cannot clean dirt because you are not on (7,6) or (8,4).

**Best action: stay**  
Reasoning: No immediate action (clean or eat) is possible. Staying allows you to assess whether moving to a dirt cell (e.g., (8,4) or (7,6)) will enable future cleaning and apple spawning. Apple spawning depends on the river being clean, which requires cleaning dirt — so moving to a dirt cell is necessary.  

**Next step:** Move to (8,4) or (7,6) to clean.  

→ **Action: move left to (8,4)** (closest and on dirt).
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,0). Agent 1 at (7,1).
  Thinking: At (5,0), I am not on land with apples yet. There's no indication of apples spawning here, and the river is likely dirty (since apples only spawn when the river is clean).  

Agent 1 is at (7,1), but that doesn’t affect me directly. I need to first clean dirt to make the river clean, which would allow apples to spawn.  

Since I can only clean dirt or eat apples *at my current position*, and there’s no apple at (5,0), I should **clean** if there's dirt here.  

But—there’s no explicit info about dirt at (5,0). So, I must assume:  
- If no dirt is visible, I can’t clean.  
- If I’m on land with dirt, I can clean it.  

No apple is present, so **eating is not possible**.  

**Best action: clean** (if dirt exists), otherwise stay.  

→ **Action: clean** (to potentially make the river clean and enable future apple spawning).  

**Reasoning**: Apples only spawn when the river is clean. Cleaning dirt is necessary, even though it gives no points. Without cleaning, no apples will spawn. I must act now to

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Agent 3 at (5,0).
  Thinking: At (7,1), I am not on a cell with an apple, and there's no information about dirt or river cleanliness. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt), and cleaning dirt gives no points, I must first assess whether I can clean dirt to enable apple spawning.

However, I don't currently have information about dirt at my position or nearby. Since I can only clean dirt *at my position*, and I can only eat apples *at my position*, I need to determine:

- Is there dirt at (7,1)? If yes, I can clean it (no points, but necessary for apples).
- If there's no dirt, then apples might already be spawning — but I need to know if there's an apple at (7,1).

Given the lack of explicit dirt or apple status, and since I have no information about the river's cleanliness or apple presence, the safest action is to **check my current cell**.

But I can’t eat unless there's an apple. Since no apple is mentioned, and I don’t know if the river is clean, I should **first clean any dirt** at (7,1) to potentially enable apple spawning.

**Action: clean**
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Dirt at (7,6), (8,4).
  Thinking: At (7,5), you are not on any dirt, so you cannot clean. There is no apple visible at your position.  

Dirt is at (7,6) and (8,4). To clean dirt, you must be on the same cell as the dirt.  

- To clean (7,6): move to (7,6) → then clean.  
- To clean (8,4): move to (8,4) → then clean.  

But cleaning dirt gives no points — it only enables apples to spawn *on land* when the river is clean.  

Currently, no apples are present, and you can't eat anything.  

Best move: **move to (7,6)** to clean dirt, which may allow apples to spawn later on land.  

→ Action: **right** (to go from (7,5) to (7,6))  

After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner, and apples may spawn on land. Then you can return and eat them.  

**Reasoning**: Cleaning dirt enables apple spawning. Without cleaning, no apples can appear. Eating apples gives +1 point each. So, prioritize cleaning first.

  Thinking: At (5,0), I am not on a cell with an apple (no apple mentioned), and there's no indication of dirt to clean. Agent 1 is at (7,1), which is unrelated to my current position unless there's interaction — but no such rule exists.

Since there's no dirt to clean and no apple visible, I cannot eat or clean.

**Best action: stay**  
Reasoning: I’m at (5,0). No apple is present, and no dirt is indicated. Moving might not help without information. Staying is safe and allows monitoring the environment for changes (e.g., if dirt appears or apples spawn later).  

→ **Stay**

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,5). Dirt at (7,6), (8,5), (7,4).
  Thinking: At (6,5), I see dirt at (7,6), (8,5), and (7,4). I am not on any of those dirt cells, so I cannot clean them directly.  

To eat apples, the river must be clean — meaning there must be no dirt. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Since dirt is present, apples are not currently spawning.  

I need to clean dirt to make the river clean and enable apple spawning. But I can only clean dirt if I'm on the same cell.  

I am at (6,5). The closest dirt is at (8,5) — directly to the right. I can move to (8,5) and clean it.  

**Action: move right to (8,5)**  
→ Now I am on (8,5), which has dirt.  
**Action: clean**  
→ Dirt is cleaned.  

Now, dirt is at (7,6) and (7,4). I need to go to those.  

Next, move to (7,6):  
**Action: move up to (7,6)**  
→ Clean (7,6)  
→ Dirt removed  

Then move to (7,
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (9,7). Dirt at (7,8), (7,6).
  Thinking: At (9,7), you are not on any dirt, so you cannot clean it directly. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary for apples to appear.

Currently, dirt is at (7,8) and (7,6). These are not adjacent to your current position (9,7), so you must move to reach them.

To maximize points:
- You must first **move to a dirt cell** to clean it.
- Cleaning dirt enables apples to spawn on land (but doesn’t give points).
- After cleaning, if apples appear, you can eat them for +1.0 each.

**Best action now: move left to (8,7)** — closer to (7,8) and (7,6).  
From there, you can proceed to clean (7,8) or (7,6) and eventually enable apple spawning.

**Reasoning**: You can't eat an apple unless there's one, and apples only spawn when dirt is cleaned. Since you're not on dirt, you must move to clean it. Cleaning dirt is necessary but not rewarding — so prioritize cleaning to enable apple spawning.

👉 **Action: left**
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (9,0). Dirt at (8,1), (8,0).
  Thinking: At (9,0), you are adjacent to dirt at (8,0) and (8,1). You cannot eat an apple yet because there are no apples present—apples only spawn when the river is clean, which depends on dirt being cleaned.  

You are on land at (9,0), which is currently not contaminated by dirt (no dirt at (9,0)), so you can **clean** dirt only if you are on a cell with dirt. You are not on (8,0) or (8,1), so you cannot clean them directly.  

To clean dirt, you must move to a cell with dirt.  

**Best action: move left to (8,0)** — you can clean the dirt there.  

After cleaning (8,0), the dirt is gone, and the river becomes cleaner. This may allow apples to spawn eventually.  

**Reasoning**: Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning. You cannot eat apples unless apples are present, and apples only appear when the river is clean. Since you're currently not on dirt, you can't clean it. Moving to (8,0) lets you clean it and progress toward a clean river.

--- Step 3 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Dirt at (7,6), (8,5), (7,4).
  Thinking: At (7,5), I see dirt at (7,6), (8,5), and (7,4). I cannot eat an apple because there are no apples visible—apples only spawn when the river is clean, and dirt must be cleaned to enable that.

I can only clean dirt that is on my current cell. Since (7,5) is clean (no dirt listed there), I cannot clean anything here.

The dirt at (7,6), (8,5), and (7,4) are not adjacent to me, so I cannot clean them directly.

Therefore, I must move to a cell with dirt to clean it. The closest dirt is at (7,6) — directly above me.

**Action: up** to (7,6)  
Now I can clean (7,6).

After cleaning (7,6), the river becomes slightly cleaner. But still, apples only spawn when the river is clean — and we need to assess if cleaning leads to apple spawning.

However, the rules say: *Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (less dirt = more apples)*. But no explicit rule says cleaning dirt at a distance spawns apples — only that cleaning dirt at your position enables apple
  Decision: 'up' -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,7). Dirt at (6,8), (7,8), (7,6).
  Thinking: At (8,7), you are not on any dirt cells. The dirt is at (6,8), (7,8), (7,6) — all of which are not adjacent to your current position.  

To eat an apple, the river must be clean (i.e., dirt must be removed), and apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Since you are not on any dirt, you cannot clean it directly.  

Possible actions:  
- **Move** to a nearby cell to get closer to dirt (e.g., (7,7) or (8,8)) — but none of the dirt cells are adjacent.  
- **Stay** — no action, no dirt to clean, no apple to eat.  

Currently, no apples are spawning (since dirt remains), and you can't clean dirt without being on it.  

**Best action: move left to (7,7)** to get closer to (7,6) and (7,8), where dirt is located. From there, you can clean dirt if you reach those cells.  

✅ Reasoning: You must first reach a dirt cell to clean it. Cleaning dirt enables apple spawning on land. Without cleaning, no apples appear.  

**Action
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Dirt at (8,1), (6,0), (8,0).
  Thinking: At (8,0), you see dirt at (8,1), (6,0), and (8,0). Since you are on (8,0), which has dirt, you can **clean** it. Cleaning dirt gives no points, but it's necessary to enable apple spawning later.

After cleaning (8,0), the dirt at (8,0) is removed. Now, the river is cleaner at that point. However, apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — but we don’t yet know if apples are available. Since dirt is still at (6,0) and (8,1), the river isn’t fully clean.

But you can only act on your current cell. So:

- **Clean (8,0)** → removes dirt from your cell, helps clean the river.
- Then, you might want to move to check other dirt spots or see if apples appear.

But currently, no apples are visible, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (less dirt). Since dirt remains at (6,0) and (8,1), the river isn't fully clean.

**Best action: clean (8,0)** → necessary step to progress.

--- Step 4 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,6). Dirt at (7,6), (8,5). Agent 2 at (7,7).
  Thinking: At (7,6): There is dirt here, so I can clean it. Cleaning dirt doesn't give points, but it's necessary to enable apple spawning. After cleaning (7,6), the river will be cleaner, potentially allowing apples to spawn on land nearby.

Currently, there's no apple visible at (7,6), and apples only spawn when the river is clean. Since I'm at (7,6) with dirt, I must first clean it.

**Action: clean**

After cleaning (7,6), the river becomes cleaner. This may allow apples to spawn on adjacent land cells (e.g., (6,6), (8,6), (7,5), (7,7)), though no apples are currently visible.

Agent 2 is at (7,7), which is adjacent — but unless there's an apple there, I can't eat it. No apple is mentioned, so I should stay focused on cleaning to enable apple spawning.

**Next step:** After cleaning, I should check if any apples have spawned (but no info is given). Since apples spawn only when river is clean, and I just cleaned (7,6), the system may now allow apples to appear.

→ Reason: No apples are visible, and cleaning dirt is required to enable apple spawning. Without knowing if dirt is present, I cannot safely clean or eat. Staying allows me to assess future conditions.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apples to spawn, the river must be clean—meaning dirt must be cleaned. However, cleaning dirt gives no points, so it's a necessary step before apples can appear.

Since you're at (8,0) and see nothing, the safest and most strategic action is to **move** to a position where dirt might be present (likely nearby), so you can clean it and eventually enable apple spawning.

**Action: left**  
(Exploring leftward from (8,0) is reasonable—perhaps dirt is nearby, and cleaning it will allow apples to spawn later, enabling you to gain points.)

→ Reasoning: Without dirt to clean, apples won’t spawn. Moving to explore for dirt is essential to progress. Eating now would be pointless.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,6). Agent 2 at (8,6).
  Thinking: At (7,6), I am on land. Agent 2 is at (8,6), directly to my right. There's no mention of dirt or apples currently, so I need to assess:

- If there's dirt, I can clean it (but cleaning gives 0 points).
- If there's an apple, I can eat it (+1.0 point).
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — so if dirt exists, it must be cleaned first.

Since no dirt or apples are mentioned, and I’m at (7,6), I should first check if there's dirt to clean. Without that information, I can't eat an apple.

But since I have no information about dirt or apples at (7,6), and I can't act without knowing the state, the safest action is to **stay** — to monitor the situation.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: No visible dirt or apples. Cleaning or eating requires specific conditions. Staying allows me to observe or respond if new info arrives.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,6). Agent 1 at (7,6).
  Thinking: At (8,6), I am currently on a cell. Agent 1 is at (7,6), directly to my left.  

To maximize points:  
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned).  
- Cleaning dirt gives no points, but is necessary to enable apple spawning.  
- I can only eat apples or clean dirt from my current position.  

Since I don't know the current state of dirt at (8,6), and there's no indication that there's an apple or dirt present, I should first **check** whether I can clean or eat.  

But no action is specified—so I must decide.  

**Best action**:  
→ **clean** (if dirt is present), because cleaning enables apple spawning later.  
→ If no dirt, then **eat** if apple is there.  

But since no dirt/fruit is mentioned, and I’m not told the environment, **safe first step is to clean**—to enable future apple spawning.  

**Action: clean**.  

(Reasoning: Without cleaning, apples won’t spawn. Cleaning is necessary groundwork. I can’t eat without apples, which require clean land. So clean first.)
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first determine if there's dirt to clean.

However, since nothing is visible, and you're at (7,0), it's possible you're on a land cell with no dirt or apples currently. Without dirt, apples won’t spawn.

**Action: stay**  
Reasoning: You cannot eat an apple if none exist, and cleaning dirt requires being on a dirt cell. Since nothing is visible, it's safest to stay and assess the environment. If dirt appears later or if movement reveals it, you can act accordingly. Right now, no action yields benefit.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,6). Agent 2 at (8,6).
  Thinking: At (7,6), I am adjacent to Agent 2 at (8,6). There's no information about dirt or apples currently, so I need to assess:

- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when there's less dirt).
- Cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary to enable apple spawning.
- I can only eat or clean what's directly at my position.

Since I don’t know the current state of dirt or apples at (7,6), and no action has been taken yet, **I should first check if there's dirt to clean** — because if there is, cleaning it may enable apple spawning later.

But since no dirt status is given, and I don’t see an apple, **I should start by cleaning if possible**.

→ **Action: clean**  
Reason: Cleaning dirt is necessary to allow apples to spawn. Without cleaning, no apples can appear. I must act to enable future apple consumption (which gives +1.0 each).  

**Next step**: After cleaning, if apples appear, I can then eat them. If not, I may need to move and assess other cells.  

But currently, with no info, **clean is the safest and necessary first move**
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,6). Agent 1 at (7,6).
  Thinking: At (8,6), I am currently on a cell. Agent 1 is at (7,6), directly to my left.  

I need to assess what’s available:  
- There’s no mention of dirt or apples at this location.  
- To eat an apple, the river must be clean (i.e., dirt must be cleaned), and apples only spawn on land when the river is clean.  
- Cleaning dirt gives no points, but is necessary to enable apples.  

Since I don’t know if there’s dirt or an apple at (8,6), and I can only act on my current cell, I should first check if there's dirt to clean.  

But no information is given about dirt or apples.  

**Best action:**  
→ **clean** (if dirt is present), or **stay** (to observe).  

Since I don’t know the state of the cell, and cleaning is necessary to enable apples, and I can’t eat without apples, I should **clean** if dirt is present.  

But if there’s no dirt, cleaning gives nothing, and I can’t eat.  

Given the lack of information, **safe and strategic move** is to **stay** to assess the situation.  

**Final
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Dirt at (6,1).
  Thinking: At (7,0), you are not on any dirt. The dirt is at (6,1), which is adjacent but not currently reachable without moving.  

To clean dirt, you must be on the same cell as the dirt. Since you're at (7,0) and dirt is at (6,1), you need to move to (6,1) first.  

**Action: move left to (6,0)** → then **move up to (6,1)** to reach the dirt.  

Once on (6,1), you can **clean** the dirt. Cleaning dirt does not give points, but it enables apple spawning on land (which may later allow eating apples).  

**Next step**: After cleaning, check if apples spawn on land — but currently, no apples are mentioned.  

**Final reasoning**: You must move to (6,1) to clean the dirt. Cleaning is necessary to enable apples to spawn. Eat only when apples are present.  

**Immediate action: move left to (6,0), then up to (6,1), then clean.**

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,6). Agent 2 at (8,6).
  Thinking: At (7,6), I am adjacent to Agent 2 at (8,6). There's no mention of dirt or apples currently, so I need to assess the situation:

- I can only clean dirt or eat apples **if I am on a cell with dirt or an apple**.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt), so cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning.
- Cleaning dirt gives **no points**, but enables apples to appear.
- Eating apples gives **+1.0 point each**.

Since I'm at (7,6), and there's no information about dirt or apples in this cell, I should first check whether there's dirt to clean or an apple to eat.

But the key point: **I can only act on what is directly at my position**.

Without knowing if there's dirt or an apple at (7,6), I cannot eat or clean.

Therefore, **I need to decide whether to move, clean, or stay**.

However, since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and I don't know the current state of dirt, **I should prioritize cleaning dirt if present** to enable apple spawning.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,4). Dirt at (8,5), (7,4).
  Thinking: You are at (7,4), which has dirt. There's also dirt at (8,5).  

Action options:  
- You can **clean** dirt only if you are on a cell with dirt.  
- Cleaning dirt does **not** give points, but it's necessary to enable apples to spawn.  
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt).  

Currently, you are on (7,4), which has dirt. You can **clean** that dirt to reduce the total dirt.  

**Reasoning:**  
Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt), cleaning the dirt at (7,4) will help create conditions for apples to appear. You can't eat an apple yet because there are no apples mentioned.  

**Best action: clean** (at (7,4))  

After cleaning, the dirt at (7,4) is gone, which improves the river's cleanliness and may allow apples to spawn in the future.  

✅ Action: **clean**
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,6). Dirt at (7,6), (8,6), (8,5).
  Thinking: At (7,6), there is dirt on your cell and adjacent cells: (7,6), (8,6), (8,5).  

You can only clean dirt **if you are on the same cell**. So:  
- You **can clean** the dirt at (7,6) right now.  
- You **cannot clean** (8,6) or (8,5) unless you move there.  

Eating apples requires the river to be clean — which depends on the total dirt being reduced. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt), cleaning dirt is necessary but doesn't give points.  

**Action:**  
→ **Clean** (7,6) — this reduces dirt on your cell and helps make the river cleaner, enabling future apple spawning.  

**Reasoning:**  
You cannot eat an apple yet (no apple present), and cleaning is required to enable apple spawning. Cleaning dirt at (7,6) is the only immediate action that advances progress.  

**Next step:** After cleaning, assess whether you can move to clean (8,6) or (8,5), or if apples have now appeared.  

**Final action: clean**.

Dirt is at (7,2) and (6,0) — both are not adjacent to you, so you can't clean them directly.  

Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and you can't clean dirt unless you're on it, you must move to one of the dirt cells to clean them.  

Best action: **move left to (7,1)** — adjacent to (7,2), so you can later clean it.  

But first, check: can you eat? No apple at (8,1). Can you clean? No dirt at (8,1).  

So: **move left to (7,1)** → then later clean (7,2).

  Obs: You at (7,4). Dirt at (8,5), (8,4).
  Thinking: At (7,4), I see dirt at (8,5) and (8,4). I am not on any dirt, so I cannot clean it yet. Apples only spawn when the river is clean, but since dirt is present, apples are not currently spawning.  

To enable apple spawning, I must clean dirt — but I can only clean dirt when I'm on the same cell. Since I'm at (7,4), I cannot clean (8,5) or (8,4) directly.  

I need to move to a cell with dirt to clean it. The closest dirt is at (8,4) — directly to the right.  

**Action: right** → move to (8,4)  

Now I am on (8,4), which has dirt. I can clean it.  

**Action: clean** → removes dirt at (8,4)  

Now, the river is cleaner (one less dirt), which may allow apple spawning. But I still need to check if apples are now available.  

Since the rule says apples spawn when the river is clean (less dirt), and we reduced dirt, apples may now spawn — but only if they appear on land.  

I am at (8,

Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,6). Dirt at (8,6), (8,5).
  Thinking: At (7,6), I see dirt at (8,6) and (8,5). I am not on any dirt, so I cannot clean yet. Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. Since I can only clean dirt when I'm on a cell with dirt, I need to move to one of those dirt cells to clean.

Best next step: **move right to (8,6)** to clean the dirt there.

After cleaning (8,6), I can then consider cleaning (8,5) if needed, or checking if apples have now spawned. But currently, no apples are visible.

Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Dirt at (7,2), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (7,1), you are not on any dirt, so you cannot clean. There's no apple visible at your position.  

Dirt is at (7,2) and (6,0) — both are not adjacent to you currently.  

To spawn apples, the river must be clean (i.e., dirt must be cleaned). Since you can only clean dirt when on the same cell, you must move to a dirt cell to clean it.  

Action plan:  
→ Move to (7,2) to clean dirt.  
→ After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn (though apples only spawn *on land* when clean).  

But currently, no apple is available.  

Best action: **right** to (8,1) or **down** to (7,0)? Wait — (6,0) is dirt. To reach it, you'd need to go to (6,0). From (7,1), go left to (6,1), then down to (6,0). But that's longer.  

The closest dirt is (7,2) — directly above you.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,4). Dirt at (8,5), (8,4).
  Thinking: At (8,4), you are on a cell with dirt. You can only clean dirt or eat apples from your current position.  

- There is dirt at (8,4) — you can **clean** it.  
- There is no apple at (8,4) currently.  
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning.  

**Action: clean**  
→ Cleaning (8,4) removes dirt and may allow apples to spawn later.  

**Reasoning:** Cleaning dirt is required to enable apple spawning. Since apples give +1.0 points and cleaning gives no points directly, we must clean to enable future apple access.  

Next step: after cleaning, check if apples appear or if we can move to find more dirt or apples.  

**Final action: clean** ✅
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,6). Dirt at (8,6), (8,5).
  Thinking: At (8,6), there is dirt, so I can clean it. Cleaning dirt doesn't give points, but it's necessary to enable apples to spawn. After cleaning (8,6), the cell becomes clean. There's also dirt at (8,5), which I can't reach yet.

Since apples only spawn on clean land, and currently only (8,6) is dirty, cleaning (8,6) is the best immediate action.

Action: **clean**  
Reason: Cleaning dirt is required to enable apple spawning. I must clean (8,6) first to make it usable for apples.
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (7,2), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (8,1), you are not on any dirt, so you cannot clean. There's no apple visible at your position.  

Dirt is at (7,2) and (6,0) — both are not adjacent to you, so you can't reach them directly.  

Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and you can't clean dirt unless you're on it, you must first move to one of the dirt cells to clean them.  

Best next step: **Move to (7,2)** (adjacent to you), then clean it.  

After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn on land — possibly enabling future apple eating.  

**Action: left** (to move to (7,1)), then possibly down to (7,2) — but (7,1) to (7,2) is down.  

From (8,1), **left → (7,1)**, then **down → (7,2)**.  

**Action: left** (to (7,1)) → then **down** (to (7,2)) → then **clean**.  

Best action: **stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Agent 1 at (5,1).
  Thinking: At (7,2), I am not currently on a cell with an apple, and I don’t have information about the river's cleanliness or dirt status. To eat an apple, I need to be on a land cell where apples spawn—only when the river is clean (i.e., low dirt). Cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary to enable apple spawning.

Since I’m at (7,2), and Agent 1 is at (5,1), there’s no immediate indication of dirt or apple presence. Without knowing the dirt status of my current cell or nearby cells, I cannot confirm if I can eat an apple.

**Best action: stay**  
Reason: I need to assess whether my current cell has dirt or apples. Moving without knowing the state could waste steps. Staying allows me to check if I can clean dirt (if needed) or eat an apple. If there's dirt, I can clean it to help the river become clean and enable future apple spawning. If there's already an apple, I can eat it.  

→ **Action: stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Agent 1 at (5,1).
  Thinking: At (6,0), I am on land. There's no apple visible, and there's no dirt mentioned directly. Agent 1 is at (5,1), which is not relevant to my current position unless there's an interaction rule—none are specified.  

Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first assess if there's dirt at my current position.  

No dirt is mentioned, so I assume there's no dirt to clean here. Therefore, I cannot clean anything.  

There's no apple at (6,0), so I cannot eat.  

Best action: **stay** — to monitor the environment, as no beneficial action is available immediately.  

**Reasoning**: No dirt to clean, no apple to eat. Staying allows observation for future opportunities (e.g., if dirt appears or apples spawn due to river cleaning elsewhere).

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,1). Agent 2 at (7,2) Agent 3 at (6,0).
  Thinking: At (5,1), I am not on a cell with an apple, and there's no immediate indication of dirt to clean. Agent 2 is at (7,2), Agent 3 at (6,0) — their positions don't directly affect me unless there's a rule about interference, which isn't stated.

**Situation analysis:**
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt).
- Cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary for apples to spawn.
- I can only clean or eat what's directly at my position.

**Current state:**
- I am at (5,1). No apple is mentioned at this cell.
- No dirt is mentioned at (5,1), so I can’t clean unless there is dirt.
- Since apples require clean river, and dirt must be cleaned first, I need to check if there's dirt at (5,1).

**Action reasoning:**
- If there's no dirt at (5,1), I can’t clean, and thus no apples can spawn here.
- Without dirt to clean, I can’t enable apple spawning.
- I cannot eat an apple unless one is present.

**Best move:**
→ **Stay** — to
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Agent 1 at (5,1).
  Thinking: At (7,2), I am not on a cell with an apple, and there's no information about dirt or river cleanliness. To eat apples, the river must be clean (i.e., low dirt), which depends on cleaning dirt cells. Since I can only clean or eat what's directly at my position, I need to first assess:

- Is there dirt at (7,2)? If yes, I can clean it (no points, but helps river cleanliness).
- Are there apples at (7,2)? If yes, I can eat them (+1.0).

Currently, no apples or dirt status is given. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt is required, I should **clean any dirt at my position** if present to help enable future apple spawning.

But since the state is incomplete, I assume no apple is currently visible. Therefore, the best action is:

**clean** — to help make the river cleaner and enable future apple spawning.

Reasoning: Without cleaning, apples won’t spawn. Cleaning is necessary groundwork, even though it gives no points. Eating is only possible if apples are present, which depends on river cleanliness. So, prioritize cleaning first.
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Agent 1 at (5,1).
  Thinking: At (6,0), I am on land. There's no apple visible, and the river is not explicitly clean. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first assess whether dirt is present.

However, I don’t have direct information about dirt at (6,0) or the river’s current state. Agent 1 is at (5,1), which is adjacent but not directly relevant unless there's a hint about dirt or apple spawning.

**Best action: stay**  
Reason: I cannot confirm if there is dirt to clean or an apple to eat. Moving might lead to waste. Staying allows me to assess the situation. If dirt is present, I can clean it later; if an apple is present, I can eat it. Without more info, staying is safest and most strategic.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,1). Agent 2 at (7,2) Agent 3 at (6,0).
  Thinking: At (5,1), I am not on any apple-containing cell, and there's no immediate indication of apples spawning. Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), which requires cleaning dirt at your position.

Since I am at (5,1), I must first check if there's dirt here. If there is dirt, I can clean it (clean action), which helps the river become cleaner and may eventually allow apples to spawn. However, cleaning gives no points directly.

Currently, no apples are visible or implied at (5,1), and I have no information about dirt at this location.

Best action: **clean** — to contribute to a cleaner river, enabling future apple spawning.  

Reasoning: Without cleaning dirt, apples won’t spawn. Eating apples is only possible after the river is clean. Since I can’t eat anything now, and cleaning is necessary for future gains, I should clean first.  

✅ Action: clean
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Agent 1 at (5,1).
  Thinking: At (7,2), I am currently on a cell. I need to assess whether there's dirt or an apple here to act.

- If there's dirt, I can clean it (clean action), but cleaning gives 0 points.  
- If there's an apple, I can eat it (+1.0 point).  
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — so if the river is dirty, no apples appear.  

However, I don’t have information about the current state of dirt at (7,2) or the river’s cleanliness. Also, Agent 1 is at (5,1), which may suggest a possible path or interference, but agents don't directly affect my actions unless stated.

**Best action:**  
Since I don’t know if there’s an apple or dirt, and I can only act on my current cell, I should **check** the state of the cell.

But since no state is given, and I must act:  
→ **Stay** at (7,2) to assess the situation.  

**Reasoning:** I don’t have enough information to clean dirt (no dirt status) or eat an apple (no apple status). Staying allows me to observe or wait for better information. If
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Agent 1 at (5,1).
  Thinking: At (6,0), there's no apple visible, and the river is likely dirty (no mention of clean state). Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary. Since we're at (6,0), we need to assess if there's dirt to clean or an apple to eat.

Agent 1 is at (5,1), which is adjacent — but agents don't interfere with each other’s actions.

**Current situation:**
- We are at (6,0).
- No apple visible → cannot eat.
- No indication of dirt → can’t clean unless there is dirt.

**Best action:**
→ **clean** (if dirt exists) or **move** to a location where dirt is present or apples might spawn.

But since we don’t know if there’s dirt at (6,0), and we can't eat anything, we must first **check**.

However, since we are told to think and act, and we have no information about dirt or apples at (6,0), we must assume it's likely dirty (to enable apple spawning later).

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,4). Agent 2 at (8,5).
  Thinking: At (8,4), I am currently on a cell. Agent 2 is at (8,5), directly above me.  

To maximize points:  
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned).  
- Cleaning dirt gives no points, but is necessary to allow apples to spawn.  
- I can only eat or clean what's directly at my position.  

Since there's no information about dirt or apples at (8,4), I must first assess:  
- Is there dirt here? Unknown.  
- If there's dirt, I must clean it to enable apples to spawn.  
- If there's an apple, I can eat it for +1.0.  

But since no state is given about dirt or apples, and I don’t know if (8,4) has dirt or an apple, **the safest and most strategic action is to clean dirt if present**, to enable future apple spawning.  

If there's no dirt, then I can only eat if there's an apple — but without confirmation, I can’t assume that.  

**Therefore, action: clean**  

This ensures I set up the possibility of future apple spawning, which is necessary to gain points.
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,5). Agent 1 at (8,4).
  Thinking: At (8,5), I am not on an apple (no apple indicated), and there's no mention of dirt here. Agent 1 is at (8,4), but agents don't affect my actions directly.

Action analysis:
- I can only *clean* dirt or *eat* apples if I'm on a cell with dirt or an apple.
- There's no indication of dirt or apple at (8,5).
- Since there's no apple, I cannot eat.
- Since no dirt is mentioned, I cannot clean.

Best action: **stay**  
Reasoning: Without any dirt or apple in sight, and no benefit from moving, staying is safest and avoids unnecessary movement. If apples appear later (when river is clean), I may need to be in position — so staying maintains readiness.  

✅ Final action: **stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Dirt at (7,2).
  Thinking: At (7,1), there is no apple visible. Dirt is at (7,2), which is directly below you. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and you can only clean dirt when you are on the same cell, you cannot clean (7,2) from (7,1).

Thus, the best action is: **down** to move to (7,2), where you can then **clean** the dirt.

After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn on land (though spawning isn't explicitly triggered in this step). But since no apples are visible now, and you haven’t eaten one, the next step would be to check if apples appear after cleaning.

**Action: down** (to reach (7,2)) → then **clean**.

Reasoning: You must clean dirt to enable apple spawning. You can’t clean it from where you are. Moving down to (7,2) allows you to clean it, which improves the environment for future apple spawning.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,4). Agent 2 at (8,5).
  Thinking: At (8,4), I am not on a dirt cell, and there's no visible apple. Agent 2 is at (8,5), which might be relevant if there's a conflict or if apples are spawning nearby, but currently, no apples are visible.

Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points, I must first assess whether there's dirt nearby to clean.

However, no dirt cells are mentioned. If there's no dirt, then no apples can spawn. Therefore, unless I can detect dirt at (8,4) or adjacent cells, I cannot clean or eat.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: No dirt is visible, no apple is present, and I cannot eat or clean without a valid target. Staying is safest and allows monitoring for changes.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,5). Agent 1 at (8,4).
  Thinking: At (8,5), there's no apple visible, and the cell is not specified as dirty. Agent 1 is at (8,4), which is directly above you. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points, we must first assess whether there's dirt to clean.

No information indicates dirt is present at (8,5). Therefore, we cannot clean dirt here. Also, no apple is mentioned at (8,5).

Action: **stay**  
Reasoning: There's no dirt to clean, no apple to eat, and no benefit in moving without information. Staying is safest and avoids unnecessary movement.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apples to spawn, the river must be clean—so dirt must be cleaned. However, cleaning dirt gives no points, only enables apple spawning.

**Reasoning**: Without any visible items, you cannot eat an apple. To eventually eat apples, you must first clean dirt. But since you can only clean dirt on your current cell, you must first check if there's dirt here.

But the prompt says "Nothing in your view" — suggesting no dirt or apples are visible. Therefore, you likely need to move to a cell with dirt to clean it.

**Action: left** (to explore adjacent cells, possibly to find dirt)  
→ Reason: You need to find dirt to clean and enable apple spawning. Without dirt, apples won’t spawn. Moving left is a logical first step to explore.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,4). Agent 2 at (8,5).
  Thinking: At (8,4), I am on land. Agent 2 is at (8,5), directly above me.  

To maximize points:  
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned).  
- Cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary to enable apple spawning.  
- I can only clean or eat what is directly at my position.  

Currently, I don’t know if there’s dirt at (8,4) or if apples are present. Since I’m at (8,4), I should first check whether I can clean dirt there — if there is dirt, cleaning it may allow apples to spawn later.  

But without knowing the current state (dirt or apple), I need to act cautiously.  

**Best first step**: *clean* — because cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning. If there's dirt, cleaning it will allow apples to appear later. If there's no dirt, it's harmless.  

→ **Action: clean**  

(Reasoning: Clean dirt to enable apple spawning; apples only appear when the river is clean. Eating apples later will give points. I cannot eat without apples, which require cleaning first.)
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,5). Agent 1 at (8,4).
  Thinking: At (8,5), I am not on an apple (no apple visible), and there's no indication of dirt to clean. Agent 1 is at (8,4), which is directly above me. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first assess whether there's dirt at my current position.

No dirt is mentioned, and no apple is present. Therefore, I cannot eat. Since cleaning gives no points, and I have no dirt to clean, I should **stay** to avoid unnecessary movement.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: No apple or dirt to interact with; staying is safe and optimal until conditions change.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Dirt at (7,1).
  Thinking: At (6,0), you are not on any dirt. The dirt is at (7,1), which is not adjacent to your current position.  

To clean dirt, you must move to the cell with dirt and then use the "clean" action.  

Currently, you cannot eat an apple (no apple is present), and cleaning dirt gives no points.  

**Action: right** → move to (7,0)  
Then, from (7,0), you can move to (7,1) to clean the dirt.  

**Best next step: right** (to (7,0))  

Reasoning: Dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning, and apples only spawn when the river is clean. Since dirt is at (7,1), you must reach it to clean it. Moving right first gets you closer.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Agent 3 at (5,0).
  Thinking: At (7,1), I am not on a cell with an apple, and I need to determine if cleaning dirt or moving is beneficial.  

Agent 3 is at (5,0), which is off my current position. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt gives no points but enables apple spawning, I must first assess whether there's dirt nearby that I can clean to enable apple growth.  

Currently, I’m at (7,1). Without knowing the grid state (e.g., whether (7,1) has dirt or apples), I assume no apple is present. To gain apples, I must first clean dirt if present.  

But I have no information about dirt or apples at (7,1).  

**Action**: *clean* — if there is dirt, cleaning it enables future apple spawning. If there's no dirt, it does nothing. Since I have no other option to enable apples, and I can’t eat anything without an apple, cleaning is the only logical first step.  

**Reasoning**: Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apples to spawn. Without cleaning, no apples can appear. Eating is only possible after cleaning.  

👉 **Action: clean**.
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,5). Dirt at (7,6), (8,4).
  Thinking: At (8,5), you can see dirt at (7,6) and (8,4). You cannot clean dirt unless you are on the same cell as it. Since you are at (8,5), you are not on (7,6) or (8,4), so you cannot clean either dirt directly.

There are no apples mentioned, so no apples are currently available to eat.

**Action:** Stay  
**Reasoning:** You cannot clean dirt or eat apples from your current position. Cleaning dirt is required to make apples spawn, but you must be on the dirt cell to do so. Since no apples are present and you can’t act on the dirt at (7,6) or (8,4) from (8,5), staying is the safest and only viable option. Future movement could allow cleaning, but no immediate benefit exists.  

**Next step:** Consider moving to (8,4) or (7,6) to clean dirt and potentially enable apple spawning. But currently, no action yields points.  

→ **Stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,0). Agent 1 at (7,1).
  Thinking: At (5,0), there's no apple visible, and the river is likely dirty (since apples only spawn when the river is clean). To enable apple spawning, I need to clean dirt first. However, I’m not currently on a dirt cell — I need to check the grid.

But based on the information given:  
- I am at (5,0).  
- Agent 1 is at (7,1).  

No dirt or apple status is directly stated. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first **clean dirt** if present.

Since I'm at (5,0), and no action is specified, I should **check if I'm on a dirt cell**. If yes, I can clean it. If not, I need to move to a dirt cell.

But no grid state is provided. So, assuming standard game logic:

👉 If I’m not on dirt, I can’t clean.  
👉 If I’m on dirt, I can clean → which may eventually allow apples to spawn.

Since I’m at (5,0) and no apple is mentioned, and apples require clean river, I must **clean dirt** if available.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Agent 3 at (5,0).
  Thinking: At (7,1), I am not on land with apples yet. The river is likely dirty (since no clean state is indicated), so apples aren't spawning. Agent 3 is at (5,0), but that doesn't directly affect me.  

To get apples, I need to first clean dirt to make the river clean — but cleaning gives no points. Only eating apples gives points.  

Since I’m at (7,1), I should first check if there's dirt to clean. If there is, I can clean it to improve the river’s cleanliness, which may eventually allow apples to spawn. But I can only clean dirt on my current cell.  

No apple is visible at (7,1), so I must first clean dirt (if present) to enable apple spawning.  

Action: **clean** (if dirt is present).  

If no dirt, then check if apples are now spawning — if not, I may need to move to a better position.  

But based on current info:  
→ **Clean** (to enable apple spawning).  

**Reasoning**: Cleaning is necessary to allow apples to spawn. Without cleaning, no apples can appear. Eating gives points, but only if apples are present — which requires a clean river
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,5). Dirt at (7,6), (8,4).
  Thinking: At (8,5), you can see dirt at (7,6) and (8,4). You cannot clean dirt that is not directly on your cell. Since neither (7,6) nor (8,4) is at your current position (8,5), you **cannot clean** them directly.

There are no apples mentioned, so you cannot eat one either.

**Best action: stay**  
Reason: You are not on dirt, so cleaning is not possible. No apples are present. Staying is safe and allows you to assess if you can move to a cell with dirt later. No immediate gain, but no risk.

→ **Action: stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,0). Agent 1 at (7,1).
  Thinking: At (5,0), I am not on land with apples currently — there's no mention of apples spawning here. The river's cleanliness determines apple spawning, and cleaning dirt is required to enable that. Since I'm at (5,0), and there's no indication of dirt or apples in this cell, I should first assess whether I can clean dirt or if there's an apple to eat.

However, the only actions allowed are:
- Move (up, down, left, right)
- Clean (if on dirt)
- Eat (if on apple)

Given that I’m at (5,0), and no apple or dirt is mentioned, **I cannot eat**. I also cannot clean unless there’s dirt on my cell.

Since no action is beneficial right now, and I need to get to a location where apples can spawn (which requires clean river), I should **move** toward a location where the river is cleaner — possibly closer to Agent 1 at (7,1), which might imply a more favorable area.

But without more environmental details, the safest action is to **move right to (6,0)** to explore the area and possibly find dirt or apples.

**Action: right**.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Agent 3 at (6,0).
  Thinking: At (7,1), I am not on a cell with an apple, and I don’t know the current state of the river or dirt levels. Agent 3 is at (6,0), which is adjacent but not directly relevant unless there's a conflict or shared objective.

To maximize points:
- I must first **clean dirt** if present (to enable apple spawning), but cleaning gives 0 points.
- Only **eating apples** gives +1.0 points.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned in the area.

Since I’m at (7,1), I should first **check if there's dirt** to clean. If there is, cleaning it will help apples spawn *somewhere*, but only if the river is clean in that region.

However, without knowing the current dirt state or apple presence, the safest and most strategic step is:

👉 **Stay** at (7,1) — to assess the environment. If there’s dirt, I can clean it. If there’s an apple, I can eat it. If not, I may need to move to a better position.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: No immediate apple or dirt is visible. Staying allows me to evaluate

Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,6). Agent 1 at (7,6).
  Thinking: At (8,6), I am currently on a cell. Agent 1 is at (7,6), directly to my left.  

To maximize points:  
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned).  
- Cleaning dirt gives no points, but is necessary to allow apples to spawn.  
- I can only eat apples or clean dirt if I'm on the same cell.  

Currently, there's no information about dirt at (8,6) or whether apples are present. Without knowing if there's dirt or an apple, I can't eat or clean safely.  

**Action: stay**  
Reason: I need to assess whether there’s dirt to clean or an apple to eat. Moving without knowing the state of the cell could lead to missing opportunities. Staying allows me to evaluate the current cell and decide whether to clean or eat.  

→ **Stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Dirt at (6,1).
  Thinking: At (6,0), there is no apple visible, but there is dirt at (6,1), directly above you.  

Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when there's no dirt), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary for apples to appear, I must clean the dirt at (6,1) to potentially enable apple spawning.  

**Action: clean**  
→ This removes the dirt at (6,1), making the area above you clean. This may allow apples to spawn later, but since no apple is currently present, eating is not possible.  

**Reasoning:** Cleaning is necessary to enable future apple spawning. I cannot eat yet, and staying or moving without cleaning won't help. Clean first.  

**Next step:** After cleaning, check if apples appear (though not visible now). Then consider eating if apples spawn.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,6). Agent 2 at (8,6).
  Thinking: At (7,6), I am adjacent to Agent 2 at (8,6). There's no information about dirt or apples currently in my cell, so I need to assess the situation.

Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when there's less dirt), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first determine if there's dirt to clean.

No dirt or apple status is specified. Therefore, I cannot eat an apple yet.

**Best action: stay**  
Reasoning: Without knowing if there's dirt or an apple in my current cell, I cannot safely perform "clean" or "eat." Staying allows me to assess the environment. If dirt is present, I can clean it later to enable apple spawning. If an apple is already there, I can eat it. But without more info, staying is safest and most cautious.  

→ **Action: stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,6). Agent 1 at (7,6).
  Thinking: At (8,6), I am currently on a cell. Agent 1 is at (7,6), directly to my left.  

There is no information about dirt or apples in this location yet. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when there is less dirt), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first assess whether there is dirt here.  

If there is dirt at (8,6), I can clean it (clean action), which may enable apples to spawn later. If there is no dirt, I can consider eating an apple—if one exists.  

But currently, no apple is mentioned, and no dirt status is given.  

**Best action: clean**  
→ Because cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning, and I have no information about apples, it's safer to clean dirt if present.  

**Reasoning:** Without knowing if there's dirt or an apple, and since apples depend on clean land, cleaning first ensures I can later eat apples when conditions allow.  

✅ Action: clean
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Dirt at (6,1).
  Thinking: At (6,0), there is no apple currently. Dirt is at (6,1), which is directly above you. Since you can only clean dirt or eat apples when you are on the same cell, you cannot clean the dirt at (6,1) unless you move there.

**Action: move up to (6,1)**  
→ Now you are on the dirt cell.  
→ You can **clean** the dirt (no points, but necessary).  
→ After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner (improves apple spawning potential).  

**Next step:** After cleaning, check if apples now spawn — but since apples only spawn *on land* when the river is clean, and we don’t have information about apple locations, we assume apples may now be available in adjacent land cells. However, without knowing where apples are, we can’t eat yet.

But since you are now on (6,1), and the dirt is cleaned, the river is cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn *on land* — but only if land cells are adjacent and now eligible.

Currently, no apple is visible, and you’re on a dirt cell.

**Best next move: stay at (6,1) after cleaning**, and wait for apples

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,6). Agent 2 at (8,6).
  Thinking: At (7,6), I am adjacent to Agent 2 at (8,6). There's no mention of dirt or apples currently, so I need to assess the situation.

Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when there's less dirt), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first determine whether there's dirt to clean at my current position.

No dirt or apple is mentioned, so I assume the current cell (7,6) may be clean or empty. Without confirmation of dirt, I cannot perform a "clean" action.

If there's no apple, I cannot eat. Therefore, the best action is to **stay** and monitor the environment—perhaps the river is clean and apples may spawn soon, or Agent 2 might be blocking access or creating a risk.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: No apple or dirt is visible. Staying allows observation and potential future action when conditions (dirt or apples) appear.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,6). Agent 1 at (7,6).
  Thinking: At (8,6), I am currently on a cell. Agent 1 is at (7,6), directly to the left.  

To maximize points:  
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned).  
- Cleaning dirt gives no points, but is necessary to allow apples to spawn.  
- I can only eat apples or clean dirt if I am on the same cell.  

Currently, there's no information about whether (8,6) has dirt or an apple. Since I don't know the state of the cell, I must first assess:  
- If (8,6) has dirt, I can clean it (no points, but enables potential apple spawning).  
- If it has an apple, I can eat it (+1.0).  

But without knowing the cell state, the safest and most strategic move is to **check the current state**. However, since no such action is available, and I must choose based on available actions, I assume the goal is to **maximize apple access**.

If I stay at (8,6), I can either eat (if apple present) or clean (if dirt present). Since I don’t know, and cleaning is
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Dirt at (6,1).
  Thinking: You are at (6,0). There is dirt at (6,1), which is directly above you.  

Since you can only clean dirt *if you are on the same cell*, you cannot clean the dirt at (6,1) from your current position.  

To clean dirt, you must move to the cell with dirt — so move **up** to (6,1).  

After cleaning, the river will become cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn (though apples only spawn when the river is clean, and they appear on land). However, cleaning itself gives no points.  

So, action: **up** → move to (6,1), then **clean**.  

After that, you can check if apples appear — but since apples spawn on land when the river is clean, and you're now on land (assuming (6,1) is land), you may be able to eat an apple if one spawns.  

But currently, no apple is mentioned.  

**Best immediate action: up** to reach the dirt cell.  

**Reasoning**: You must clean dirt to enable apple spawning. You can't clean dirt from a distance. You are currently one cell away. Move up to clean.  

But the question asks for reasoning *

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,4). Dirt at (8,5).
  Thinking: You are at (8,4). Dirt is at (8,5), which is directly below you.  

Since you can only clean dirt if you are on the same cell, you must **move down to (8,5)** to clean it.  

Cleaning dirt does not give points, but it is necessary to make apples spawn (and eventually allow you to eat them).  

**Action: down**  
→ Move to (8,5) and clean the dirt.  

(Next step: After cleaning, check if apples now spawn—currently no apples are mentioned, so apple spawning depends on the state of the river, which isn't fully described. But since dirt is reduced, apples may appear in the future. For now, cleaning is necessary.)  

✅ Reasoning: Clean the dirt to enable apple spawning. You must move to the dirt's location to clean it.
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,6). Dirt at (8,5).
  Thinking: At (8,6), there is no apple visible. Dirt is at (8,5), which is directly below you. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and you can only clean dirt if you're on the same cell, you cannot clean the dirt at (8,5) from (8,6).

Therefore, the best action is: **down** to move to (8,5), where you can then **clean** the dirt. Cleaning dirt does not give points, but it enables apple spawning on land (which may happen later). After cleaning, you can then explore or return to check for apples.

**Action: down**.
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Dirt at (7,2), (6,0), (8,0).
  Thinking: At (7,1), you are not on any dirt, so you cannot clean. There is no apple visible at your position.  

Dirt is at (7,2), (6,0), and (8,0). To spawn apples, the river must be clean — but apples only appear on land when the river is clean. Since we don’t have a clear definition of "river" or "land," and no apples are currently visible, we assume apples only spawn *after* dirt is cleaned.  

You can only clean dirt if you are on the same cell. So:

- To clean (7,2): move to (7,2) → then clean it.  
- To clean (6,0): move to (6,0).  
- To clean (8,0): move to (8,0).  

But cleaning dirt gives no points — only eating apples gives +1.0 each.  

Currently, no apple is at (7,1). So unless you move to a cell with dirt and clean it, apples won’t spawn.  

**Best action: Move to (7,2) to clean it.**  
→ After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner (less dirt), which may enable apple spawning

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,3). Dirt at (7,2).
  Thinking: At (8,3), you are not on any dirt, so you cannot clean it. Dirt is at (7,2), which is not adjacent to your current position. Therefore, you cannot clean it directly.

Since there are no apples mentioned and the river is not described as clean, apple spawning is unlikely. Apples only spawn when the river is clean — which requires cleaning dirt — and we can't clean dirt unless we're on it.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: You cannot clean dirt at (7,2) from (8,3). No apples are available. Staying is safe and allows you to assess if movement or cleaning becomes possible later.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,5). Dirt at (8,5).
  Thinking: You are at (8,5), and there is dirt at your position.  

Action: **clean**  
Reason: You can only eat apples when there is clean land, and apples only spawn on clean land. Since you're currently on dirt, you must clean it first to enable apple spawning. Cleaning dirt gives no points directly, but it's necessary to make apples appear. After cleaning, you can potentially eat an apple if one spawns.  

→ Do **clean**.
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (7,2), (6,0), (8,0).
  Thinking: At (8,1), you are not on any dirt, so you can't clean. There's no apple visible at your position.  

Dirt is at (7,2), (6,0), (8,0) — none of these are adjacent to (8,1).  
- (8,0) is directly below you — could be cleaned if you move down to (8,0).  
- (7,2) is not adjacent — too far.  
- (6,0) is far away.

**Best action:** Move down to (8,0) to clean dirt. Cleaning dirt enables apple spawning in the future (when river is clean), which increases apple availability.  

**Action: down**  
→ Now at (8,0), can clean dirt.  

**Reasoning:** Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apples to spawn. Since apples only appear when the river is clean, and we are currently far from any apple, cleaning dirt first is essential. Eating apples now is not possible.  

**Next step:** After cleaning (8,0), check if apples appear or if we can move toward other dirt or apple zones.

--- Step 12 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,3). Dirt at (7,2).
  Thinking: At (8,3), you are not on any dirt. The dirt is at (7,2), which is not adjacent to your current position.  

To clean dirt, you must move to a cell with dirt and then use the "clean" action. Since you're not on dirt, you can't clean it yet.  

Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), but currently, there's no apple visible or implied.  

**Action:** Move to (7,2) to clean the dirt.  
**Reasoning:** Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning. Without cleaning, no apples can appear. You must first reach the dirt to clean it.  

→ **Action: left, down** (to move from (8,3) to (7,3), then to (7,2))  
Then: **clean** at (7,2).  

After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn on land — then you can eat them.  

**Next step after cleaning:** Check for apples (if any) and move to eat them.  

But currently, only cleaning is possible.  

✅ **Immediate action: move left to (7,3
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,5). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,5), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apples to spawn, the river must be clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. However, cleaning dirt gives no points, only enables apple spawning.

**Reasoning**: Without seeing dirt or apples, you cannot take action. You must first move to a cell with dirt to clean it. Cleaning dirt is necessary to eventually spawn apples, which give +1.0 points each.

**Next step**: Move to a neighboring cell (up, down, left, or right) to find dirt and clean it.  
→ **Action: left** (to (7,5)) — explore adjacent area.
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Dirt at (6,0), (8,0).
  Thinking: At (8,0), you see dirt at (6,0) and (8,0). You are currently on a cell with dirt, so you can **clean** it.  

- **Eating** is not possible yet because there's no apple on (8,0) — apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed).  
- Cleaning dirt gives no points directly, but it's necessary to enable apple spawning.  

**Action: clean**  

After cleaning (8,0), the dirt is gone. Now, the river is cleaner, and apples may spawn on land. However, apples only spawn *when the river is clean*, and we don't yet know if apples are available. But since the river is now clean (at least at (8,0)), and land is accessible, it's a step toward apple spawning.  

**Next step:** Monitor for apple spawning, then eat if available.  

But currently, I have no apple to
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,7). Dirt at (6,8), (7,8), (7,6). Agent 1 at (7,6).
  Thinking: At (7,7), I see dirt at (6,8), (7,8), (7,6). Agent 1 is at (7,6), which has dirt — but I can only clean or eat what I'm on.

I am at (7,7), which is clean. There's no apple here yet because apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned). Dirt at (7,6) is adjacent — I can move to (7,6) to clean it, but I can only clean dirt *on my current cell*.

So:
- I cannot clean (6,8) or (7,8) from (7,7) directly.
- I can only clean dirt if I'm on a cell with dirt.

Currently, I am on (7,7), which is clean. The only dirt I can clean is if I move to a cell with dirt — such as (7,6).

So, best action: **move left to (7,6)** to clean the dirt there.

After cleaning (7,6), that dirt is gone. Now, the river is cleaner in that area, which may allow apples to spawn — but apples only spawn *on land
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Dirt at (8,1), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (8,0), you see dirt at (8,1) and (6,0). You cannot eat an apple yet because there are no apples present — apples only spawn when the river is clean, which requires cleaning dirt.

**Action: clean (8,1)**  
- You are at (8,0), so (8,1) is directly above you.  
- Cleaning (8,1) removes dirt and helps make the river cleaner, enabling possible apple spawning.  
- Cleaning (6,0) is not possible directly since it's to the left and not adjacent.  

**Reasoning:**  
You must clean dirt to enable apple spawning. Since you can only clean dirt on your current cell or adjacent cells (depending on rules), and (8,1) is adjacent, you can clean it. (6,0) is not adjacent — you can't reach it from (8,0) without moving.  

✅ Action: **clean (8,1)**  
Then, after cleaning, check if apples spawn — but currently, no apples are visible.  

Next step: after cleaning, you may be able to eat apples if they appear. But currently, no apples are present.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,6). Dirt at (8,5). Agent 2 at (6,7).
  Thinking: At (7,6), there is dirt at (8,5), which is not adjacent to you. You cannot clean it directly. Agent 2 is at (6,7), but they don't affect your actions.  

There's no apple visible at your current position. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and you can't clean (8,5) from (7,6), no apples are currently spawning.  

**Action:** Stay.  
**Reasoning:** You cannot clean the dirt at (8,5) from your current position, and no apple is available. Moving would not help without a clear path to clean dirt or find an apple. Staying is the safest and most rational choice.  

→ **Action: stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,7). Dirt at (6,8), (7,8). Agent 1 at (7,6).
  Thinking: At (6,7), there is no apple currently. Dirt is at (6,8) and (7,8), both of which are adjacent but not directly on the agent’s position.

- **Action: clean** – Possible at (6,7)? No dirt at (6,7), so cleaning does nothing.  
- **Action: eat** – No apple at (6,7), so cannot eat.  
- **Move?** Moving to (6,8) or (7,7) might allow access to dirt or better apple potential.

Best move: **move down to (7,7)**.  
Why?  
- (7,7) is adjacent to dirt at (7,8).  
- From there, we can clean (7,8) later.  
- Cleaning dirt improves the river’s cleanliness, which increases apple spawning potential.  
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — so cleaning is essential for future apple gains.

**Action: down** → (7,7)  
Then later: clean (7,8) if possible.  

**Final decision: down**.
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Dirt at (8,1), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (8,0), you see dirt at (8,1) and (6,0).  

- You **cannot eat an apple** yet because there are no apples visible — apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned).  
- You **can clean dirt** only if you are on the same cell as the dirt.  
  - You are at (8,0), so you can **clean (8,1)** only if you move there.  
  - You are **not on (6,0)**, so you can't clean that dirt directly.  

**Best action: Move to (8,1) to clean the dirt there.**  
After cleaning (8,1), the river becomes cleaner, which may enable apple spawning (though apples only appear on land when clean).  

But note: cleaning dirt gives **no points**, only enables apple spawning.  

So, reasoning:  
👉 **Move right to (8,1)** → clean dirt → improves river cleanliness → may allow apples to spawn later.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,6). Dirt at (8,7), (8,5). Agent 2 at (6,6).
  Thinking: At (7,6), there is no apple currently, and the river is not clean (dirt at (8,7) and (8,5)) — so apples won't spawn yet. To enable apple spawning, I must clean dirt.  

I can only clean dirt if I'm on the same cell as it. Since I'm at (7,6), I cannot clean (8,7) or (8,5) directly.  

So, I need to **move** to a cell with dirt to clean it.  

Best move: **right** to (8,6) — this is adjacent to (8,7) and (8,5), and allows me to eventually clean one of them.  

But wait — I can only clean dirt **on my current cell**. So I must move to a cell with dirt.  

Currently, dirt is at (8,7) and (8,5). I'm at (7,6).  

- (8,7): down-right from me → not adjacent  
- (8,5): down-left → not adjacent  

So I must move to reach either (8,7) or (8,5).  

(7,6) → (8,6
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,6). Dirt at (8,7), (8,5). Agent 1 at (7,6).
  Thinking: At (6,6), there is no apple currently. Dirt is at (8,7) and (8,5), both of which are not adjacent to (6,6), so you cannot clean them directly. You cannot eat an apple because none are present at your current position.

To enable apple spawning, you must clean dirt — but cleaning only occurs when you are on a cell with dirt. Since you are not on any dirt cell, you cannot clean it yet.

Best action: **move** to a nearby dirt cell (e.g., (8,6) or (7,5)) to reach a position where you can clean dirt.

However, (8,7) and (8,5) are both on row 8. The closest adjacent cells are (7,6) — which is occupied by Agent 1 — and (8,6). (8,6) is adjacent to both (8,5) and (8,7).

So:  
→ Move **right** to (7,6)? No — occupied by Agent 1.  
→ Move **down** to (7,6)? Same issue.  
→ Move **right** to (7,7)? Not adjacent to dirt.  
→ Move **
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (9,0). Dirt at (8,1).
  Thinking: You are at (9,0). Dirt is at (8,1), which is not adjacent to you. You cannot clean dirt unless you are on the same cell as it. Since you're not on (8,1), you cannot clean it directly.

Currently, there are no apples visible, and apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. Since you can't clean (8,1) from (9,0), no apples can spawn yet.

**Best action: move left to (8,0)** — now you're adjacent to (8,1), and if you can move to (8,1) or get closer, you might be able to clean it. But currently, you can only clean dirt if you're on the same cell.

So, **move left to (8,0)** to get closer to the dirt.

**Reasoning**: You must first reach the dirt cell to clean it. Without cleaning dirt, apples won't spawn. Cleaning dirt (even without points) is essential to enable apple spawning. You cannot eat apples now.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,4). Agent 2 at (8,5).
  Thinking: At (8,4), I am currently on a cell. Agent 2 is at (8,5), directly above me.  

To maximize points:  
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned).  
- Cleaning dirt gives no points, but is necessary to enable apple spawning.  
- I can only eat or clean what is directly at my current position.  

Since there’s no information about whether (8,4) has dirt or an apple, and I don’t know the state of the river or surrounding cells, I should first assess whether I can clean dirt to enable apple spawning.  

However, since I have no indication that (8,4) has dirt, and no apple is mentioned, I cannot eat yet.  

**Best action: stay** — to monitor the situation. If there’s dirt, I can clean it. If I later observe an apple, I can eat it.  

But if I can’t see dirt or apples, and no action leads to progress, staying is safe.  

👉 **Action: stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,5). Agent 1 at (8,4).
  Thinking: At (8,5), I am not on a dirt cell, and there's no apple visible. Agent 1 is at (8,4), which is directly above me. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points, I must first check if there's dirt to clean.

However, I don’t have information about whether (8,5) or (8,4) has dirt. Since I’m at (8,5), and no apple is present, I cannot eat. If there's dirt, I could clean it—but that gives no points. Without knowing the current state of the terrain, I cannot confirm if cleaning is beneficial.

Best move: **stay** — to assess the situation further. If dirt is present, I can clean it later; if not, I can explore nearby cells.

**Action: stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Dirt at (7,1).
  Thinking: You are at (7,0). There is dirt at (7,1), which is directly above you.  

Action: **up** → move to (7,1)  
Then: **clean** → clean the dirt at your new position.  

Why?  
- You can only clean dirt when you are on the cell with dirt.  
- Cleaning dirt does not give points, but it's necessary to make apples spawn later (since apples only appear when the river is clean).  
- You cannot eat an apple yet because there's no apple at (7,0) or (7,1) — apples spawn only after dirt is cleaned and the river is clean.  

So, first move up to (7,1), then clean.  

**Next step: clean**.  

(No eating yet — no apple present.)

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,4). Agent 2 at (8,5).
  Thinking: At (8,4), I am on land. Agent 2 is at (8,5), directly above me.  

To maximize points:  
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned).  
- Cleaning dirt gives no points but enables apple spawning.  
- I can only clean or eat what I'm on.  

Right now, I don’t know if there's dirt at (8,4), but since I’m on land, and apples spawn only when the river is clean, I need to first clean any dirt to allow apples to appear.  

However, I don’t see dirt mentioned, so I assume the current cell (8,4) may be clean. But without confirmation, I can't eat an apple yet.  

Best action: **clean** — to ensure the river is clean and apples can spawn.  

After cleaning, if apples appear, I can then **eat** them.  

→ Action: **clean**
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,5). Agent 1 at (8,4).
  Thinking: At (8,5), there's no apple visible, and the cell is not confirmed to have dirt. Agent 1 is at (8,4), which is directly above. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points, we must first determine if there's dirt to clean.

No dirt is mentioned, and we have no indication that (8,5) has dirt. Therefore, we cannot clean anything here.

We cannot eat an apple unless one is present — and there’s no sign of one.

Best action: **stay** — to monitor the situation, possibly wait for dirt to appear or for an apple to spawn if the river becomes clean.  

**Reasoning**: Without dirt to clean or an apple to eat, and with no information about environmental state, staying is safest and most strategic. Cleaning or eating would be invalid or unproductive right now.  

**Action: stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Dirt at (7,2), (7,1).
  Thinking: At (7,1), you are on a cell with dirt. You cannot eat an apple because there's no apple visible—apples only spawn when the river is clean, which depends on dirt being cleaned.  

Action: **clean**  
Reason: You must clean the dirt at (7,1) to progress. Cleaning dirt doesn't give points, but it's necessary to potentially enable apple spawning later. After cleaning, you can assess whether apples now appear (though no apple is visible yet).  

→ Choose: **clean**

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,4). Agent 2 at (8,5).
  Thinking: At (8,4), I am not on a dirt cell, and there's no apple visible. Agent 2 is at (8,5), which is directly above me. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and I have no dirt to clean here, I cannot spawn apples. 

I should check if there's dirt nearby to clean to enable apple spawning. Since I’m at (8,4), I can move to adjacent cells to assess. However, no action is currently beneficial. 

Best action: **stay** — I’m not on dirt, so I can’t clean. I can’t eat either. Moving might help, but without knowing the terrain, it's risky.  

→ **Stay** (no immediate benefit, but safe and neutral).
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,5). Agent 1 at (8,4).
  Thinking: At (8,5), there's no apple visible, and the cell is not specified as having dirt. Agent 1 is at (8,4), which is directly above. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, we must first assess whether there's dirt to clean.

No dirt is mentioned at (8,5), so we can't clean anything here. Also, no apple is present. Therefore, the only possible action is to **stay** — moving would be unnecessary without knowing the environment or potential dirt/apples elsewhere.

**Action: stay**  
**Reasoning:** No apple or dirt to act upon. Staying is safest and avoids wasting moves. Apple spawning depends on clean river (dirt cleaned), which isn't currently available or visible here.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Dirt at (7,2).
  Thinking: At (7,1), there is no apple visible. Dirt is at (7,2), which is directly below you. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and you can only clean dirt when you are on the same cell, you cannot clean the dirt at (7,2) from (7,1).

Therefore, the best action is to **move down to (7,2)** to clean the dirt. Cleaning dirt gives no points, but it's necessary to eventually allow apples to spawn.

**Action: down**.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,1). Agent 2 at (7,2) Agent 3 at (6,0).
  Thinking: At (5,1), I am not on a cell with an apple, and there's no immediate indication of dirt to clean. Agent 2 is at (7,2), Agent 3 at (6,0), so they may be cleaning or eating elsewhere.  

Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning gives no points, I must first consider whether there's dirt nearby to clean. But no dirt status is given.  

Currently, no apple is visible at (5,1), so I cannot eat.  

Best action: **stay** — to monitor the situation. If dirt is present later or if I can observe movement of others, I might act. But with no dirt or apple info, I cannot clean or eat.  

**Action: stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Agent 1 at (5,1).
  Thinking: At (7,2), I am currently on a cell. There's no information about dirt or apples directly on this cell. Agent 1 is at (5,1), but that doesn't affect me unless there's interaction — which there isn’t based on rules.

**Key rules to apply:**
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt).
- Cleaning dirt gives **no points**, but is necessary for apples to spawn.
- I can only eat/clean at my current position.

**Current situation:**
- I’m at (7,2). No apple or dirt status is given.
- Without knowing if there’s dirt or an apple here, I can't eat or clean yet.

**Best action:**
→ **Stay** — to assess the situation. I need to know if there's dirt to clean or an apple to eat. Moving without information may lead to missing opportunities.

**Reasoning:**  
I don’t have evidence of dirt or apples at (7,2). Since cleaning gives no points and apples only appear when the river is clean, I should not act prematurely. Staying allows me to observe or wait for useful information (e.g., if dirt appears or apples spawn).  

**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Agent 1 at (5,1).
  Thinking: At (6,0), there's no apple visible, and the river is likely dirty (no apples spawn unless clean). Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt gives no points but is required, I need to assess the situation.

Agent 1 is at (5,1), which is adjacent. But I can only act from my current position. 

Right now, I am at (6,0). If there's dirt here, I can clean it — but that gives no points. If there's no dirt, I can't spawn apples. Since apples don’t spawn without clean river, and I don’t have any apple in sight, **I should clean any dirt** to potentially enable apple spawning later.

But: **I cannot see the state of the dirt at (6,0)**. So, I must assume it might be dirty.

**Action: clean** — to prepare the environment for future apple spawning.

→ Reasoning: Cleaning is necessary to enable apple spawning. Without cleaning, no apples will appear. Eating now is not possible. So, prioritize cleaning.  

**Final action: clean**.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,1). Agent 2 at (7,2) Agent 3 at (6,0).
  Thinking: At (5,1), I am not on a cell with an apple (no apple spawn info), and there's no indication of dirt to clean. Agent 2 is at (7,2), Agent 3 at (6,0) — their positions don’t directly affect me unless they’re blocking or sharing resources.

Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first determine if there's dirt at (5,1).

No dirt is mentioned, so I assume (5,1) is clean. But without dirt, no apples spawn.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: I cannot eat an apple unless one is present, and apples only spawn when the river is clean. Since I’m not on dirt, I can’t clean it. There's no evidence of apples at (5,1). Staying is safe and allows me to assess further if new info comes.  

→ **Final action: stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Agent 1 at (5,1).
  Thinking: At (7,2), I am currently on a cell. I need to assess whether there's dirt to clean or an apple to eat.  

Since no direct info about dirt or apples at (7,2) is given, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), I must first determine if there's dirt to clean.  

No dirt or apple status is mentioned, and I don’t know the state of the river or surrounding cells.  

Given that:  
- Cleaning dirt gives no points but enables apple spawning.  
- Eating apples gives +1.0 point.  

**Best action:** *clean* — if there's dirt, cleaning it will allow apples to spawn later. If there’s no dirt, it’s a waste of action. But without knowing the current state, I cannot eat.  

**Therefore, reasoning:** To maximize long-term points, I should clean dirt if available — it's necessary to enable apple spawning. Since I don’t know the terrain, and I can only act on my current cell, I proceed with **clean**.  

👉 Action: **clean**
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Agent 1 at (5,1).
  Thinking: At (6,0), I am on land. There's no dirt visible here, and I see Agent 1 at (5,1), who might be nearby. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary for apples, I should first assess whether there's dirt to clean.

Currently, I'm at (6,0). If there's dirt on this cell, I can clean it. But if there's no dirt, I can't clean anything and can't spawn apples. Since the situation doesn't indicate dirt at (6,0), and apples only spawn when the river is clean, I should check if there's any dirt nearby that I can clean to enable apple spawning.

However, I have no information about dirt at (6,0) or adjacent cells. Without knowing if there's dirt, I can't proceed with cleaning.

**Best action: stay**  
Reason: I don't know if there's dirt to clean. If I move, I might miss a chance to clean dirt at my current position. Staying allows me to evaluate the situation. If there's dirt, I can clean it; if not, I can wait for apples to spawn.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,1). Agent 2 at (7,2) Agent 3 at (6,0).
  Thinking: At (5,1), I am not on a cell with an apple, and there's no indication of dirt to clean. Agent 2 is at (7,2), Agent 3 at (6,0) — their positions don't directly affect me unless they are blocking or interfering, which isn't specified.

Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first determine if there's dirt to clean at my current position.

Currently, I am at (5,1). There's no information confirming dirt is present here. Without dirt, I cannot clean, and without cleaning, apples won't spawn.

**Action:** Stay.  
**Reasoning:** I need to assess whether there's dirt at (5,1) to clean. Without that, I cannot enable apple spawning. Since no dirt is mentioned, and I have no apples, staying allows me to observe or wait for more information. If dirt is present later, I can clean it. Otherwise, I cannot gain points.  

→ **Stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Agent 1 at (5,1).
  Thinking: At (7,2), I am not on land with apples yet. There's no mention of dirt or apples directly at my position. Agent 1 is at (5,1), but that doesn't affect me directly.  

To maximize points:  
- I need to **clean dirt** to enable apple spawning.  
- Apples only spawn **on land when the river is clean** — so cleaning is necessary.  
- Eating apples gives +1.0 points, but cleaning gives 0 points.  

Since I’m currently at (7,2), I should **check if there's dirt** here. If there is, I can clean it. If not, I may need to move to a dirt-covered cell to clean.  

**Action: clean** (if dirt is present) — this enables potential apple spawning later.  

If no dirt, I should **move** to a dirt cell to clean.  

But since no info about terrain at (7,2), safest assumption: **check current cell**.  

→ **Action: clean** (if dirt is present; otherwise, move to a dirt location).  

  Obs: You at (8,5). Dirt at (7,6), (8,4).
  Thinking: At (8,5), you can see dirt at (7,6) and (8,4). You cannot clean dirt that is not directly adjacent to you. Since both dirt cells are not at your current position, you cannot clean them directly.

To clean dirt, you must move to a cell with dirt and then use the "clean" action. However, you cannot clean (7,6) or (8,4) from (8,5) without moving there first.

- (8,4) is directly below you — you can move down to (8,4) and clean it.
- (7,6) is diagonally up-left — you cannot reach it directly without moving to (7,5) or (6,6), etc., which is farther.

So, best immediate action: **move down to (8,4)** and **clean** it. This will reduce dirt, potentially enabling apple spawning on land near (8,5) or (8,4).

After cleaning, you can assess whether apples are now possible. But currently, no apple is visible.

**Action: down, then clean.**

(No apple to eat yet — only cleaning improves conditions.)
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Agent 1 at (7,1).
  Thinking: At (6,0), I am not on a cell with an apple (no apple indicated), and there's no dirt mentioned to clean. Agent 1 is at (7,1), which is irrelevant unless there's interaction — but no rules mention agent interaction.

Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points, I must first determine if there's dirt to clean at (6,0).

No dirt is mentioned, so I cannot clean. No apple is present. Therefore, I cannot eat.

Best action: **stay** — to monitor the situation. If dirt appears or apples spawn later (due to clean river), I can act then.

**Reasoning**: No apple, no dirt to clean. Staying is safe and allows for future opportunity.  
**Action: stay**.

  Obs: You at (7,1). Agent 3 at (6,0).
  Thinking: At (7,1), I am on land. I need to assess whether there's an apple to eat or if I need to clean dirt first to enable apple spawning.

- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt).  
- Cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary for apples to appear.  
- I can only act on my current cell.

Since I am at (7,1), and Agent 3 is at (6,0), there's no immediate indication of dirt or apples in my current cell. Without confirmation of dirt or an apple present, I cannot eat.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: I need to check if there's dirt to clean or an apple to eat. Since no info is given about dirt or apples at (7,1), staying allows me to monitor the situation. If dirt is present, I can clean it; if an apple appears after cleaning, I can eat it. Moving without knowing the state might lead to missing opportunities.

Actions available:  
- **Clean** → can clean the dirt at (8,4) (gives no points, but necessary).  
- **Eat** → cannot eat yet, no apple at (8,4).  
- Moving (up, down, left, right) might lead to other dirt or apples, but apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed).  

Currently, there's no apple at (8,4), and cleaning dirt is required to enable apple spawning.  

**Best action: clean**  
→ Removes dirt at (8,4), which helps make the environment cleaner (enables potential apple spawning later).  

**Reasoning**: Eating apples gives +1.0 points, but only if apples are present. Apples spawn when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt). Since dirt is currently present, and cleaning is required to enable apple spawning, I must clean first.

  Obs: You at (7,1). Agent 3 at (6,0).
  Thinking: At (7,1), I am on land. I need to assess whether there's an apple to eat or if I need to clean dirt first.

- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt).  
- Cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary to enable apple spawning.  
- I can only act on my current cell.

Currently, I don’t know the state of the dirt at (7,1) or the river’s cleanliness. Since I’m at (7,1), if there's dirt here, I can clean it—this may allow apples to spawn later. But if there’s already an apple, I can eat it immediately.

However, with no information about dirt or apples at (7,1), and no indication of apple presence, **the safest and most strategic first step is to clean dirt if present**, to enable future apple spawning.

But since I don’t know if there’s dirt, I can’t assume. Still, **cleaning is only beneficial if dirt is present**—and since apples require a clean river (which starts with cleaning dirt), cleaning is necessary to enable apple spawning.

Therefore:  
**Action: clean** — to prepare the land for possible apple spawning.

Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,4). Dirt at (6,3), (7,3).
  Thinking: At (8,4), you are not on any dirt, so you cannot clean. There are no apples visible, and apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — currently, dirt is at (6,3) and (7,3), so the river is not clean yet.

To enable apple spawning, you must clean the dirt. However, you can only clean dirt when you are on the same cell as it.

Currently, you are at (8,4), and dirt is at (6,3) and (7,3). You cannot reach those cells without moving.

**Best action: Move to a cell adjacent to dirt (e.g., (7,4) or (6,4)) to get closer.**

But since you can only clean dirt when on the same cell, and you're not on any dirt, **you cannot clean yet**.

So, **first step: Move to (7,4) or (6,4)** to get closer to (6,3) or (7,3).

Let’s pick **left to (7,4)** — it's adjacent to (7,3), which has dirt.

**Next step: Move to (7,3)** to clean it.

Action available:  
- **Stay**: I’m at (6,0). No apple present, so eating is not possible.  
- **Move**: I can explore to find dirt to clean (to enable apple spawning) or an apple.  
- **Clean**: Only if on dirt. No dirt mentioned at (6,0).  
- **Eat**: Only if on an apple. No apple here.

**Best move**: **Right** to (7,0) — possibly closer to dirt or to explore the area where apples might spawn.  
Apples spawn only when the river is clean (dirt cleaned), so I must first clean dirt to enable apple spawning.

Right now, there's no indication of dirt at (7,1), so apples may already be spawning. But if there's dirt (not stated), cleaning it would be necessary. Since no dirt is mentioned, and you're on land, you can *eat* an apple if one is present.  

However, since no apple is explicitly mentioned, and we don’t know if one is there, the safest action is to **stay** and assess.  

But if the goal is to maximize points and apples only spawn when clean, and we are on land, we must first **clean** if dirt is present.  

No dirt is mentioned, so assume current state is clean.  

Therefore:  
✅ You can eat if an apple is present.  
❌ But we don’t know if one is there.  

**Current best action: clean** ✅

--- Step 13 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,3). Dirt at (7,2).
  Thinking: At (7,3), there is dirt at (7,2), directly below you. Since you can only clean dirt when you are on the same cell, you cannot clean (7,2) from (7,3). 

To clean dirt, you must move to the cell with dirt. So, move **down** to (7,2) to clean it.  

After cleaning, the river will be cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn (though no apples are currently visible). However, cleaning itself gives no points.  

Only after cleaning can apples potentially spawn — and only if they appear on land. Since no apples are mentioned, you cannot eat yet.  

**Action: down** (to clean the dirt at (7,2)).
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,5), nothing is visible, so I don't know if there's dirt or an apple. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points, I must first determine whether there's dirt to clean.

Without any visible items, I cannot confirm if there's dirt or an apple. Therefore, I should **stay** to assess the situation further. Moving without knowing the environment could lead to missing opportunities or wasting actions.

**Action: stay**  
(Reason: No visible items — cannot safely clean or eat. Staying allows for better observation or future action based on updated information.)
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Dirt at (6,0).
  Thinking: You are at (8,0). Dirt is at (6,0). You cannot clean dirt unless you are on the same cell. Since you are at (8,0) and dirt is at (6,0), you are not on the dirt cell.

Action options:
- Move left to (7,0) → still not on dirt.
- Move left again to (6,0) → now on dirt → can clean it.
- After cleaning, dirt is removed → river becomes cleaner → apples may spawn (but only if on land and river is clean).

But: Cleaning dirt gives 0 points, and apples only spawn *when the river is clean*, not immediately after cleaning. However, since you are on land and cleaning dirt at (6,0), once cleaned, the river becomes cleaner, and apples might appear *somewhere on land*.

But you can only eat apples *when you are on a cell with an apple*. So, after cleaning (6,0), you might want to move to a land cell where apples could spawn.

But currently, there's no apple mentioned.

Best action: **Move left to (6,0)** to clean the dirt.

→ Clean (6,0) → dirt removed → river cleaner

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Dirt at (7,2).
  Thinking: You are at (7,2), and there is dirt at your position.  

Action: **clean**  
Reason: You can only eat apples when there is clean land, and apples only spawn on clean land. Since you're on dirt, you must clean it first to make space for apples. Cleaning dirt gives no points directly, but it's necessary to enable future apple spawning.  

After cleaning, you'll be on clean land at (7,2), and apples may spawn there (depending on river cleanliness, which isn't specified but is assumed to be improving).  

Next step: Monitor for apples. If apples appear, you can then **eat** them.  

✅ Action: **clean**
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,5), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately.  

First, you need to explore to find dirt (to clean) or apples (to eat). Cleaning dirt enables apples to spawn later, so exploration is key.  

**Action: left**  
→ Move to (6,5) to explore nearby cells.  

Reasoning: Without any visible items, movement is necessary to discover dirt or apples. Cleaning dirt is required to enable apple spawning, so finding dirt first is a strategic step toward earning points.
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Dirt at (6,0).
  Thinking: You are at (7,0). Dirt is at (6,0), which is to your left.  

Action: **left**  
Reason: You need to move to the cell with dirt at (6,0) to clean it. Cleaning dirt enables apples to spawn on land (since apples only appear when the river is clean). Once the dirt is cleaned, you can potentially eat apples if they spawn later.  

Cleaning dirt gives no points directly, but it's essential for enabling apple spawning.  

→ Move **left** to (6,0) and perform **clean**.

--- Step 15 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,2), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apple spawning, you must first clean dirt. However, without knowing the terrain or whether dirt is present, you can't act.

But since you're at (7,2) and nothing is visible, it's possible you're on clean land or on a cell with no dirt. Without dirt, apples won't spawn.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: You need to explore or confirm if dirt is present. Staying allows you to assess your surroundings or wait for better visibility. Moving blindly might lead to wasting steps. Best to stay and observe.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,5). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,5), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apples to spawn, the river must be clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. However, you can only clean dirt that is on your current cell.  

Since nothing is visible, it's likely your cell (6,5) is either clean or has no dirt. Without confirmation, you cannot assume dirt exists.  

**Best action: stay**  
Reason: You cannot eat (no apple visible), and cleaning is only effective if dirt is present. Since nothing is visible, staying allows you to assess the situation further. If dirt appears later, you can act.  

**Action: stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Dirt at (6,0).
  Thinking: You are at (7,0). Dirt is at (6,0), which is to your left.  

Since you can only clean dirt *if you are on the same cell*, you cannot clean the dirt at (6,0) from (7,0).  

To clean dirt, you must move to (6,0) and then use the "clean" action.  

After cleaning, the land at (6,0) becomes clean, which may allow an apple to spawn there — but apples only spawn *on land* when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt). Since you're not currently on a cell with dirt, and there's no apple visible, there's no apple to eat yet.  

**Best action: move left to (6,0)**  
→ Then clean the dirt.  
→ This helps enable apple spawning (indirectly), and prepares the area for future apple access.  

**Next step:** After cleaning, check if an apple appears. If so, you can eat it.  

**Final reasoning:** You must move to the dirt cell to clean it. Cleaning is necessary to enable apples to spawn, even though it gives no points.

  Obs: You at (7,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,2), nothing is visible. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first check if there's dirt to clean. Without any visible items, I cannot eat an apple.  

Action: **stay**  
Reason: No visible dirt or apples. I need to explore or detect dirt first. Staying allows me to assess the environment without moving blindly. If dirt appears in future observations, I can clean it. If apples later spawn, I can eat them.  

Wait — the prompt says "nothing in your view," so I have no information about surroundings. Therefore, I cannot proceed with clean or eat.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,6). Agent 2 at (8,6).
  Thinking: At (7,6), I am on land. Agent 2 is at (8,6), adjacent to me.  

First, check if there's an apple here — no mention of one, so I can't eat.  
There’s no indication of dirt at (7,6), so I can’t clean unless dirt is present.  

Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt), and cleaning dirt doesn't give points, I must assess whether cleaning dirt here would help. But without knowing the state of the terrain (dirt or not), I can’t act.  

Best move: **Stay** — I don’t have any apple or dirt to act on. If dirt is present, I’d need to clean it to enable apple spawning. But without confirmation, I shouldn’t assume.  

**Action: stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,6). Agent 1 at (7,6).
  Thinking: At (8,6), I am currently on a cell. Agent 1 is at (7,6), directly to my left.  

To maximize points:  
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned).  
- Cleaning dirt gives no points, but is necessary to allow apples to spawn.  
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point.  

Since I am at (8,6), I need to assess whether there's dirt here. If there is dirt, I must clean it (costs no points, but enables apple spawning). If there’s no dirt, I can only eat an apple if one is already present.  

But currently, there is no information about dirt at (8,6) or apple presence.  

**Action Plan:**  
→ First, check if there's dirt at (8,6). If yes, clean it.  
→ After cleaning, if an apple appears (due to clean river), I can eat it.  

Since no apple or dirt status is given, and I can't eat without one, **the safest and most strategic first step is to clean any dirt at my current position**.  

**Action: clean**  

(Reason: Cleaning
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,1). Dirt at (7,2), (6,1), (8,1).
  Thinking: At (6,1), you are on a cell with dirt.  
Dirt is also at (7,2) and (8,1).  

**Action Analysis:**  
- You **cannot eat** an apple here yet because there's dirt on your cell and no apple is mentioned.  
- You **can clean** the dirt at (6,1) — cleaning it will help make the river cleaner, which enables apples to spawn *on land*.  
- Cleaning dirt gives **no points**, but it’s necessary to enable apple spawning.  
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt), so cleaning is a prerequisite.  

**Best move:**  
→ **clean** (to reduce dirt at (6,1))  

After cleaning, the dirt at (6,1) is removed. This helps clean the river, potentially allowing apples to spawn on land (though spawning location isn't specified). You can then explore or move to other cells to check for apples.  

**Reasoning:** Clean first → enables apple spawning → then eat apples.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,6). Agent 2 at (8,6).
  Thinking: At (7,6), I am adjacent to Agent 2 at (8,6). There's no mention of dirt or apples currently, so I must assess the situation:

- I can only clean dirt or eat apples **if I am on a cell with dirt or an apple**.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned).
- Cleaning dirt gives **no points**, but is necessary to enable apple spawning.
- Eating apples gives **+1.0 point each**.

Since there's no information about dirt or apples at (7,6), I cannot eat an apple. I also don’t know if there’s dirt to clean.

**Best action:**  
→ **Stay** at (7,6) to monitor the situation. If dirt is present, I can clean it. If apples spawn after cleaning, I can eat them.

**Reasoning:** Without knowing the state of the environment, moving risks missing opportunities. Staying allows me to observe and act appropriately when dirt or apples are present.  

**Action: stay** ✅
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,6). Agent 1 at (7,6).
  Thinking: At (8,6), I am currently on a cell. Agent 1 is at (7,6), directly to my left.  

To maximize points:  
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned).  
- Cleaning dirt gives no points, but is necessary for apples to appear.  
- I can only eat apples or clean dirt if I'm on the same cell.  

Right now, I don’t know if there's dirt at (8,6) or if there’s an apple. Since I’m not told there’s an apple or dirt, I must first assess whether cleaning is needed.  

If there’s dirt, I should clean it to enable apples to spawn. If there’s no dirt, I can’t gain anything by cleaning.  

But since I don’t have visibility of the state of (8,6), and I don’t know if there’s dirt or an apple, the safest and most strategic first step is to **check my current cell**.  

However, I can only **clean** or **eat** if I’m on a cell with dirt or apple.  

Since I don’t have information about the current state, and I need to enable apple spawning (which requires
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,1). Dirt at (7,2), (8,1).
  Thinking: At (6,1), you are not on any dirt, so you can't clean yet. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, but currently, there's dirt at (7,2) and (8,1) — both outside your current position.  

To enable apple spawning, you must clean the dirt. However, you can only clean dirt if you are on the same cell as the dirt.  

So:  
- You are at (6,1).  
- Dirt is at (7,2) and (8,1).  
→ You are not on (8,1), so you can't clean it.  
→ You can't reach (7,2) directly without moving.  

**Best action: Move to (8,1)** — you can then clean that dirt. After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn on land.  

**Next step**: After cleaning (8,1), you can then move to (7,2) to clean it, further improving river cleanliness.  

Once the river is clean, apples may spawn on land (but only if they are on land cells — not explicitly stated, but implied).  

**Immediate action**: Move right to (7

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,6). Agent 2 at (8,6).
  Thinking: At (7,6), I am adjacent to Agent 2 at (8,6). There's no mention of dirt or apples currently, so I need to assess:

- If there's dirt at (7,6), I can clean it (clean action) to potentially enable apple spawning.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned in relevant areas.
- Cleaning gives no points, but is necessary for apples to appear.
- I can only eat apples if they are present on my current cell.

Since no dirt or apples are mentioned, and I’m not told the state of the terrain, the safest action is to **check my current cell**.

→ **Action: clean**  
Reason: Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning. Without cleaning, apples won’t appear, and I can’t gain points. I must first ensure the environment is clean before eating.  

(If dirt is not present, cleaning is unnecessary, but it’s still safe and strategic to start with.)
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,6). Agent 1 at (7,6).
  Thinking: At (8,6), I am currently on a cell. Agent 1 is at (7,6), directly to my left. There's no information about dirt or apples currently in this cell or nearby.  

Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first assess whether there's dirt to clean.  

No dirt status is given, so I cannot assume dirt is present. Without confirmation of dirt, I cannot perform a "clean" action.  

If there's no apple visible and no dirt to clean, I cannot eat.  

Therefore, **best action: stay** — to monitor the situation. If dirt appears or if I learn that the river is dirty, I can then clean. Only after cleaning can apples potentially spawn.  


--- Step 7 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,6). Dirt at (8,7), (8,5). Apple at (10,7). Agent 2 at (7,6).
  Thinking: At (8,6), you see dirt at (8,7) and (8,5), and an apple at (10,7). Agent 2 is at (7,6), but there's no mention of conflict or interference.

**Analysis:**
- You can only clean dirt or eat apples **at your current position**.
- The apple at (10,7) is not at your current cell, so you cannot eat it directly.
- Dirt at (8,7) and (8,5) are not at your position — you can only clean dirt **on your cell**.
- Therefore, you **cannot clean** the dirt at (8,7) or (8,5) from here.

**Conclusion:**
You cannot clean any dirt or eat any apple from your current position.  
**Best action: stay** — no beneficial action is possible now.  
(If you move, you might reach dirt or apple, but you can only clean or eat when on the cell.)

→ **Action: stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,6). Dirt at (8,7), (8,5). Agent 1 at (8,6).
  Thinking: At (7,6), there is no apple currently, and the river is not clean (dirt at (8,7) and (8,5) are present). Apples only spawn when the river is clean, meaning dirt must be cleaned.

Action analysis:
- **Clean** is possible only if on a dirt cell. I am at (7,6), not on (8,7) or (8,5). So I cannot clean dirt directly.
- **Eat** is not possible — no apple at (7,6).
- Moving to (8,6) would place me adjacent to Agent 1 and near the dirt at (8,7) — but I can’t clean unless I’m on the dirt.

Best move: **Move to (8,6)** to get closer to the dirt. From there, I can potentially clean (8,7) or (8,5) if I move to those cells.

But note: I can only clean dirt if I'm on a dirt cell. So I must move to (8,7) or (8,5) to clean them.

Currently:
- (8,7): dirt → I can clean it if I go there.
- (8,5): dirt

Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Dirt at (8,1), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (8,0), you can see dirt at (8,1) and (6,0).  

- You **cannot eat** an apple right now because there's no apple visible — apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned).  
- You **can clean dirt** only if you are on the same cell as the dirt.  
  - You are at (8,0), so you can **clean (8,1)** only if you move there.  
  - You are not on (6,0), so you can't clean that dirt directly.  

**Best action: move up to (8,1)** to clean the dirt there.  

Cleaning dirt doesn't give points, but it helps make the river cleaner, which enables apples to spawn later.

--- Step 8 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,6). Dirt at (8,7), (8,5). Apple at (10,7). Agent 2 at (7,6).
  Thinking: At (8,6), you see dirt at (8,7) and (8,5), and an apple at (10,7). Agent 2 is at (7,6), but since we're focused on maximizing points, we must prioritize:

- **Clean dirt** to enable apple spawning (apples only spawn on land when river is clean).
- **Eat apples** when possible (gives +1.0 each).

Currently, you are at (8,6). Dirt is at (8,7) and (8,5) — both adjacent. You can only clean dirt **on your current cell**. So:

- You cannot clean (8,7) or (8,5) directly — you'd need to move there first.
- The apple at (10,7) is not on land unless the river is clean. Since (10,7) is not adjacent to you, and there’s no indication of dirt there, we assume it’s currently unreachable.

**Action plan:**

1. Move to (8,7) to clean the dirt there.  
   → After cleaning (8,7), the river becomes cleaner, which might allow apple spawning in adjacent cells (e.g., (9
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,6). Dirt at (8,7), (8,5). Agent 1 at (8,6).
  Thinking: At (7,6), there is no apple currently, and the river is not clean (dirt at (8,7) and (8,5) are present). Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning all dirt must be removed.

Since dirt is at (8,7) and (8,5), and Agent 1 is at (8,6), I cannot clean those cells directly unless I move to them. I am at (7,6), so I can move to (8,6) to reach Agent 1’s position — but that doesn’t help unless I can clean from there.

However, I can only clean dirt **if I am on the same cell** as the dirt. So:

- To clean (8,7): must go to (8,7)
- To clean (8,5): must go to (8,5)

Currently, I’m at (7,6). I can move to (8,6) (down), then to (8,7) or (8,5), but (8,5) is two cells left from (8,6), and (8,7) is one right.

So:

- Move down to (8,6)
-
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (7,2), (8,1), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (8,1), you are currently on a cell with dirt.  
Dirt is also at (7,2) and (6,0), but only dirt on your current cell can be cleaned.

**Action: clean**  
→ Cleaning dirt at (8,1) removes it from your position.  
This doesn’t give points, but it’s necessary because apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., no dirt).  

After cleaning (8,1), the dirt at (7,2) and (6,0) remains — they are not adjacent or reachable unless you move.  

Now, check: is there an apple?  
Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Since we cleaned (8,1), and assuming the river is otherwise clean, apples may now spawn *on land cells* — but we don’t have information about apple locations or spawn rules beyond that.  

But currently, no apple is visible at (8,1).  

**Next step:** After cleaning, you can move to check if apples appear on adjacent land cells. But since we don’t know where apples are, and we can only eat if on a cell with an apple, best action is to **clean first

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (9,6). Dirt at (8,7), (8,5). Apple at (10,7). Agent 2 at (7,5).
  Thinking: At (9,6):  
- Dirt is at (8,7) and (8,5) — not directly adjacent.  
- Apple is at (10,7), which is to the right of current position.  
- Agent 2 is at (7,5), far away — no immediate threat or interference.  

**Can I eat the apple at (10,7)?**  
No — not currently on that cell.  

**Can I clean dirt?**  
Only if I'm on a dirt cell. I'm at (9,6), which has no dirt. Dirt is at (8,7) and (8,5) — not adjacent. So I cannot clean them directly.  

**Best action?**  
Move to a position where I can either:  
- Clean dirt (to enable apple spawning), or  
- Reach an apple.  

(10,7) is adjacent — move **right** to (10,6). From there, I can move to (10,7) to eat the apple.  

But: **Apples only spawn when the river is clean**. However, the dirt is at (8,7) and (8,5). Are these on the
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Dirt at (8,5), (7,4). Agent 1 at (9,6).
  Thinking: At (7,5), there is no apple currently. Dirt is at (8,5) and (7,4), both of which are adjacent but not directly on the agent’s position.  

- **Clean** is possible at (8,5) or (7,4) only if the agent moves there.  
- **Eat** is not possible now since no apple is present at (7,5).  
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — so cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning.  

**Best action: clean (8,5)**  
→ Moving to (8,5) to clean it. This reduces dirt and improves river cleanliness, potentially enabling apple spawning in the future.  

**Reasoning:** Cleaning dirt is required to spawn apples, and eating apples gives points. Since no apple is available now, cleaning dirt first is the optimal step to enable future apple spawning.  

**Action: right** (to move to (8,5)) → then **clean**.
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (7,2), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (8,1), you are not on any dirt, so you cannot clean. There's no apple visible at your position.  

Dirt is at (7,2) and (6,0) — both are not adjacent to you. So you can't clean them directly.  

Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned). Since you can't reach or clean those dirt cells from (8,1), no apples are currently spawning.  

**Best action: stay**  
You can't gain points by eating (no apple), and cleaning is not possible from here. Moving away would not help either.  

**Reasoning:** No immediate benefit in moving or cleaning. Stay to avoid wasting turns.  


--- Step 20 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,4). Dirt at (7,3). Agent 2 at (8,5).
  Thinking: At (8,4), there is no apple currently. Dirt is at (7,3), which is not adjacent to you — so you cannot clean it directly. To spawn apples, the river must be clean, but since dirt is not adjacent to you, you can't clean it yet.

You cannot eat an apple because none is present at your location. Cleaning dirt is only possible if you are on a cell with dirt. Since you are not on (7,3), you cannot clean it.

**Best action: stay**  
Reason: You are not adjacent to any dirt, so you can't clean or eat. Staying is safe and allows you to monitor the situation. If dirt moves or becomes adjacent later, you can act then. No immediate gain, but no risk.

**Final action: stay** ✅
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,5). Agent 1 at (8,4).
  Thinking: At (8,5), I am not on an apple (no apple indicated), and there's no mention of dirt to clean. Agent 1 is at (8,4), which is directly above me.  

Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first assess whether there’s dirt at (8,5).  

No dirt is mentioned, and I don’t have any indication that (8,5) has dirt. Therefore, I cannot clean anything.  

There's no apple at (8,5) either.  

Best action: **stay** — I cannot eat (no apple), and I cannot clean (no dirt). Moving would be unnecessary without information about terrain or apples.  

**Action: stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apples to spawn, the river must be clean—meaning dirt must be cleaned. However, cleaning dirt gives no points, only enables apple spawning.

Since you're at (7,0) and see nothing, it's likely your current cell is either clean or empty. Without visual confirmation of dirt or apples, **you should first check your surroundings** to find dirt to clean.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: You need to assess your surroundings before acting. Staying allows you to evaluate whether there's dirt nearby (which you can clean to enable apple spawning) or if apples are already present. Without movement, you can't gain new information.  

Wait: If no dirt is visible and no apples, you might be in a clean area with no spawnable apples. But since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and you're at (7,0), it's possible the river is clean here. If no dirt is visible, then no cleaning is needed.  

But you can’t eat apples without them being present. So if no apples and no dirt, you cannot gain points.

**Best action: stay**

--- Step 21 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,4). Dirt at (7,3). Agent 2 at (8,5).
  Thinking: At (8,4), there is no apple visible, and the only dirt is at (7,3), which is not adjacent to your current position. You cannot clean dirt at (7,3) unless you move there first.

Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and you are not on dirt, you cannot currently spawn apples.

Available actions:
- Move to (7,3) to clean dirt → possible, but cleaning dirt gives no points.
- After cleaning, if the river becomes clean, apples might appear on land — but we don’t have info on where apples spawn.
- Currently, no apple is available to eat.

Best move: **move left to (7,4)** or **down to (8,3)** to get closer to (7,3) and potentially clean dirt.

But since the only dirt is at (7,3), the best action is:

👉 **left to (7,4)** — to get closer to (7,3) for cleaning.

**Reasoning**: Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning, and currently, no apples are available. Moving toward the dirt allows future cleaning and potential apple spawning. Eating is not possible now.
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,5). Agent 1 at (8,4).
  Thinking: At (8,5), I am not on an apple (no apple mentioned), and there's no indication of dirt to clean. Agent 1 is at (8,4), which is directly above me. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points, I must first assess whether there's dirt at my position.

No dirt or apple is mentioned at (8,5), so I cannot eat or clean. The best action is to **stay** and monitor the situation — perhaps dirt or apples will appear when the river is cleaned elsewhere. Without any dirt or apple available, no action yields points.

**Action: stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first determine whether there's dirt to clean.

However, with nothing in view, it's likely that your current cell (7,0) may not have dirt, or dirt is not visible. Without dirt, you cannot clean it, and thus no apples can spawn.

**Action: stay**  
Reasoning: Since you see nothing and have no visible dirt or apples, cleaning or eating is not possible. Staying allows you to assess the environment further—perhaps movement to adjacent cells will reveal dirt or apples. No action yields immediate benefit. Waiting is safe and strategic.

--- Step 22 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,4). Dirt at (7,3). Agent 2 at (8,5).
  Thinking: At (7,4), there is dirt at (7,3) directly below you. Since you can only clean dirt when on your current cell, you must first move to (7,3) to clean it. Cleaning dirt does not give points, but it is necessary to improve the river's cleanliness and enable apple spawning.

After cleaning (7,3), the river becomes cleaner, which increases the chance of apples spawning on land — potentially allowing you to eat apples later. However, currently, there's no apple visible at your position.

**Action: move down to (7,3) to clean the dirt.**  
Reasoning: Cleaning dirt is required to enable apple spawning. Without it, no apples can appear. Moving down is the only viable step to make progress.
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,5). Agent 1 at (7,4).
  Thinking: At (8,5), I am currently on a cell. I need to assess whether there's dirt or an apple here to act.

- If there's dirt, I can clean it (clean action) — this doesn't give points but helps make apples spawn later.
- If there's an apple, I can eat it (+1.0 point).
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt overall), so cleaning dirt is essential for future apple spawning.

Currently, no information is given about dirt or apples at (8,5), or the state of the river. Since I don’t know if there’s an apple or dirt, I should **check the immediate surroundings** or consider strategy.

But since I can only act on my current cell, and no apple or dirt is mentioned, I **cannot eat** or **clean** with certainty.

Best action: **stay** — to observe the situation and possibly detect if there's dirt or an apple at (8,5).

**Action: stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first determine if there's dirt to clean. Without sight of any items, you cannot confirm whether dirt exists at your position.

Action: **clean**  
Reason: Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning. Since apples don't appear without clean conditions, and you're at (7,0) with nothing visible, it's safest to clean your current cell to potentially enable future apple spawns. This action doesn't give points directly, but it's essential for enabling future apple growth.  

**Reasoning**: Cleaning dirt is essential to enable apple spawning. Without it, no apples can appear. Eating apples is
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Agent 1 at (5,1).
  Thinking: At (6,0), I am on land. There's no apple visible, and I'm not adjacent to any known apple or dirt. Agent 1 is at (5,1), which is not directly relevant unless there's a rule about interference or cooperation (none stated).  

Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first assess whether there's dirt to clean. However, no dirt is mentioned in the current state.  

No apple is present at (6,0), so I cannot eat.  

Best action: **stay** — I don’t have any dirt to clean, and no apple to eat. Waiting might allow future apple spawning if dirt is cleaned later, but no action is available to improve the situation now.  

**Action: stay**.

--- Step 47 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,1). Agent 2 at (7,2) Agent 3 at (6,0).
  Thinking: At (5,1), I am not on a cell with an apple, and I don’t have direct visibility of the river's cleanliness or apple spawn status. Apples only spawn when the river is clean, which depends on dirt being cleaned. Since I am not on dirt, I can't clean it directly.  

Agent 2 is at (7,2), Agent 3 at (6,0) — their positions don’t provide immediate benefit unless they are cleaning dirt or have apples.  

**Best action: stay**  
I am at (5,1). Without knowing if there's dirt or an apple here, I cannot clean or eat. Cleaning requires being on dirt, and eating requires being on an apple. Since no apple is confirmed and no dirt is visible, and I have no information about the river’s state, **staying** is safest.  

**Reasoning:** No action leads to points without risk. Cleaning gives no points, and eating only works if an apple is present — which depends on river cleanliness, not visible here. Thus, stay to assess.  

→ **Action: stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Agent 1 at (5,1).
  Thinking: At (7,2), I am currently on land. To maximize points, I need to assess whether there are apples available to eat. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt). Since no dirt levels are specified, and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary for apple spawning, I must first determine if dirt is present on my current cell or nearby.

However, I am at (7,2). There’s no indication of dirt at this location, and no direct information about the river’s cleanliness. Without knowing if dirt exists on my cell, I can't confirm if apples are present.

Since I can only eat apples if on a cell with one, and I don’t know if one exists, the safest and most strategic move is to **check the environment**. But since I can only act directly at my position, I should:

- First **clean** if dirt is present (to enable apple spawning), or  
- **Eat** if an apple is already there.

But I don’t know if there’s dirt or an apple.

Given that cleaning dirt gives no points but enables apple spawning, and apples only spawn when the river is clean, I must assume that unless dirt is present, no apples spawn.

No
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Agent 1 at (5,1).
  Thinking: At (6,0), there's no apple visible, and the river is likely dirty (since apples only spawn when the river is clean). To enable apple spawning, I must first clean dirt. However, I need to check if there's dirt at my current position.

Since the state doesn't specify dirt at (6,0), and I don’t see any apple, it's likely the river is still dirty. To get apples, I need to clean dirt — but only if I'm on a cell with dirt.

Given no dirt is mentioned, and no apple is present, I should **stay** to assess. If there's dirt elsewhere, I’d need to move to clean it. But without more info, safest action is:

**stay** — to monitor the situation and possibly clean if dirt is detected.  

(No apple, no dirt confirmed → cannot eat or clean yet.)

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,1). Agent 2 at (7,2) Agent 3 at (6,0).
  Thinking: At (5,1), I am not on a cell with an apple, and there's no immediate indication of dirt to clean. Agent 2 is at (7,2), Agent 3 at (6,0), so they are not near me. 

Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I need to assess if there's dirt nearby to clean. However, no dirt is mentioned in the current state.

Currently, I have no apple to eat and no dirt to clean. Therefore, the best action is to **stay** to monitor the situation — perhaps dirt or apples will appear nearby or I can move to a better position to interact with the environment.

**Action: stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Dirt at (8,2). Agent 1 at (5,1).
  Thinking: At (7,2), there is dirt at (8,2), which is adjacent to the agent's position. Since the agent can only clean dirt *on their current cell*, they cannot clean the dirt at (8,2) directly.

- **Action options**:
  - **Move to (8,2)**: Would allow cleaning the dirt at (8,2), but only if the agent moves there.
  - **Clean**: Cannot clean dirt at (8,2) from (7,2).
  - **Eat**: No apple at (7,2), so cannot eat.
  - **Stay**: No benefit — no dirt to clean, no apple to eat.

**Best action**: Move **right** to (8,2) to clean the dirt.

**Reasoning**: Cleaning dirt is necessary to improve river cleanliness (which enables apple spawning). Even though cleaning gives no points, it's essential for enabling future apple spawns. Without cleaning, apples won't appear. Therefore, move to (8,2) and clean.

✅ Action: **right** → then **clean**.
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Agent 1 at (5,1).
  Thinking: At (6,0), I am on land. There's no dirt visible here, so I can't clean. I should check if there's an apple to eat. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt), and there's no indication of dirt at (6,0), there's likely no apple.

Agent 1 is at (5,1), which is adjacent — possibly monitoring or cleaning nearby. But I can only act from my current position.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: I’m at (6,0), and there’s no dirt to clean or apple to eat. Moving would be unnecessary. Staying allows me to monitor the environment or wait for conditions (like river cleanliness) to improve, which might lead to apple spawning. Cleaning or eating is not possible now.

  Obs: You at (5,1). Dirt at (6,2). Agent 3 at (6,0).
  Thinking: At (5,1), there is dirt at (6,2), and Agent 3 is at (6,0).  

I cannot eat an apple because there is no apple visible at my current position.  
I can clean dirt only if I am on a cell with dirt — I am at (5,1), and dirt is at (6,2), so I can't clean it directly.  
I cannot reach (6,2) without moving, and I can only clean dirt when I'm on the same cell.  

So, to enable apple spawning, I need to clean dirt — but I can't clean (6,2) from (5,1).  

Best action: **move right to (6,1)** — this is adjacent to (6,2), and might allow future movement to clean dirt.  
But currently, I can't clean or eat.  

Wait — I am at (5,1). I can move to (6,1) first. Then from there, I can move to (6,2) to clean dirt.  

But the rule says: "You can only eat/clean items at your position." So I can only clean dirt if I'm on a cell with dirt.  

Final action: **stay** (safe, cautious, waits for new information).
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,5). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,5), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apple spawning, you must first clean dirt. However, without knowing the state of the surrounding cells (e.g., whether there's dirt nearby), you can't act with certainty.

**Best action: stay**  
Reason: You're currently at (6,5) with no visible items. Moving without information might lead you into a cell with no dirt or apples. Staying allows you to assess the situation or prepare to clean if dirt is later detected. If dirt appears, you can then clean it to enable apple spawning.  

→ **Stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Dirt at (6,0).
  Thinking: At (6,0), there is dirt. Since you can only clean dirt when on your cell, you should **clean** the dirt.  

Cleaning dirt gives no points directly, but it's necessary to make apples spawn later (since apples only appear when the river is clean).  

**Action: clean**  

Reasoning: Cleaning the dirt at (6,0) is essential to eventually enable apple spawning. Eating apples is the only way to gain points, and apples only appear when the river (or land) is clean. Without cleaning, no apples can spawn. So, prioritize cleaning.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,2), nothing is visible. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first check if there's dirt to clean. Without visibility, I cannot confirm the state of the cell or surroundings.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: I need to assess my current cell's condition before acting. If there's dirt, I can clean it to enable apple spawning. Without visibility, moving blindly risks missing opportunities. Staying allows me to evaluate the situation before making a decision.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,5). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,5), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first determine whether there's dirt to clean.

However, with nothing in view, it's unclear if there's dirt at your current position. Since you can only clean dirt *if on your cell*, and you have no information about dirt at (6,5), **you cannot clean or eat**.

Best action: **stay** — to remain in position and assess the situation. If dirt appears or if you gain information later, you can act accordingly.

**Action: stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first determine if there's dirt to clean.

However, since nothing is visible, it's possible that your current cell is clean or that dirt is not present. Without direct observation, you cannot confirm whether dirt exists.

**Action: stay**  
Reasoning: Staying allows you to assess the environment more carefully. If you move without knowing the state of the surroundings, you might miss opportunities or end up in a dead end. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (which requires cleaning dirt), and you currently see nothing, it's safest to remain and possibly detect dirt or apples in the next observation.  

Wait — but the rule says: "Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (less dirt = more apples)." So if dirt is present, cleaning it enables apple spawning. But if you can't see dirt, you can't act on it.

Therefore, **stay** is the safest action to gather more information.  

✅ Final action: **stay**

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,2), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apple spawning, you must first clean dirt — but you can only clean if there is dirt on your current cell.

No dirt visible → no dirt to clean → no apples can spawn.

Action: **stay**  
Reason: You need to explore or find dirt to clean first. Staying allows you to assess the surroundings or wait for new information. Without dirt, you can’t gain apples.  

(Next step: Move to a neighboring cell to check for dirt or apples.)
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,5). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,5), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first determine whether there's dirt to clean.

However, with nothing in view, it's likely that you're on a clean cell or there's no dirt present. Without dirt, apples won’t spawn, so eating is not possible.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: No visible dirt or apples. Moving might not help without information. Staying allows you to assess the environment or wait for potential changes. Cleaning is only beneficial if dirt is present, which isn't visible. Thus, best action is to stay and monitor.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apple spawning, the river must be clean—meaning dirt must be cleaned. However, cleaning dirt gives no points, only enables apples to spawn later.

**Action: stay**  
Reasoning: Without any visible items, moving would be pointless. Staying in place allows you to assess the environment later. If dirt is present, you’ll eventually detect it and can clean it. Apple spawning depends on cleanliness, so cleaning dirt (even without immediate reward) is essential for future points. Waiting to act is optimal until you can detect dirt or apples.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,2), nothing is visible, so I don't know if there's dirt or an apple. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first check the environment.

But I have no view — I can't see what's around me. Therefore, I cannot determine if there's dirt to clean or an apple to eat.

Action: **stay**  
Reason: I need to assess my surroundings first. Without visibility, I cannot safely clean or eat. Staying in place allows me to potentially gain information in the next step (if the game provides updates or view upon action).
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,5). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,5), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately.  

First, you must investigate your surroundings to find dirt (to clean) or apples (to eat).  

Action: **left**  
→ Move to (5,5) to explore adjacent cells.  

Reasoning: Without any visible items, you need to scan the environment. Moving in a direction allows you to discover dirt or apples. Cleaning dirt enables apple spawning, and apples give points. You cannot gain points without first cleaning.  

**Action: stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Dirt at (7,2), (8,1).
  Thinking: At (7,1), you can see dirt at (7,2) and (8,1).  

- You **cannot eat an apple** yet because there are no apples visible — apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned).  
- To enable apple spawning, you must **clean dirt**.  
- You are at (7,1), so you can **clean dirt at (7,2)** (directly below you) or **(8,1)** (to your right).  

But you can only clean dirt **if you are on the same cell** as the dirt. So:  
- You are at (7,1), so you **cannot clean (8,1)** — it's not adjacent in a way that allows action.  
- (7,2) is directly below you — you can **move down to (7,2)** and then clean it.  

**Best action:** Move down to (7,2), then clean it.  

After cleaning (7,2), the river becomes cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn on land nearby — possibly enabling future apple eating.  

**Action: down** (to reach (7,2)) → then

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,6). Agent 2 at (8,6).
  Thinking: At (7,6), I am adjacent to Agent 2 at (8,6). There's no information about dirt or apples currently in my cell. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when there's less dirt), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first assess whether there's dirt to clean.

No dirt or apple presence is mentioned. Without confirmation of dirt or apples at (7,6), I cannot perform *clean* or *eat*.

Best action: **stay** — to monitor the environment and wait for more information (e.g., dirt or apple spawn) that might allow me to clean or eat. Moving might expose me to risks or waste steps without benefit.

**Reasoning**: No immediate action yields points. Cleaning is necessary but gives no points. Eating requires apples, which depend on clean river conditions — unknown here. Staying is safe and allows for situational awareness.

→ **Action: stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,6). Agent 1 at (7,6).
  Thinking: At (8,6), I am currently on a cell. Agent 1 is at (7,6), directly to my left.  

I need to assess what I can do:  
- If there's dirt on my current cell (8,6), I can clean it (clean action) — this helps make the river cleaner, which enables apples to spawn.  
- If there's an apple on (8,6), I can eat it (+1.0 point).  
- I cannot eat or clean from another cell — only from my current position.  

Since no information is given about dirt or apples at (8,6), I must assume:  
- There's no apple visible, so I cannot eat.  
- There may be dirt (common in such environments), so cleaning might be necessary to enable future apple spawning.  

**Action: clean**  
Reasoning: Cleaning dirt is necessary to improve the river's cleanliness, which enables apple spawning. Without cleaning, apples won’t appear. Eating is not possible now, and moving would only be beneficial if I can reach a better location with apples — but I don’t have that info. Cleaning is a prerequisite step.  

✅ Action: clean
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Dirt at (8,1).
  Thinking: At (7,0), you are not on any dirt, so you can't clean it. Dirt is at (8,1), which is not adjacent to your current position. You cannot eat an apple because there is no apple present (apples only spawn when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt is required—but you're not on dirt).  

Available action: **move right** to (8,0) to get closer to (8,1). From there, you can potentially clean the dirt at (8,1).  

**Best action: right**  
Reason: To enable apple spawning, you must clean dirt. You need to reach (8,1) to clean it. Moving right puts you adjacent to that dirt.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,6). Agent 2 at (8,6).
  Thinking: At (7,6), I am adjacent to Agent 2 at (8,6). There's no information about dirt or apples currently, so I must assume the river is not clean yet (no apples). 

Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I should first assess whether I can clean dirt to enable apple spawning.

However, no dirt status is given. Without knowing if there's dirt at (7,6), I can't clean. Therefore, the safest and most logical action is to **stay** and assess the environment. If dirt is present, I can clean it later. If apples are already present, I can eat them.

But since no apple or dirt status is provided, and I'm not given any visual or environmental data, **I must stay** to avoid missing opportunities or making a move that could lead to a dead end.

✅ Action: **stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,6). Agent 1 at (7,6).
  Thinking: At (8,6), I am currently on a cell. Agent 1 is at (7,6), directly to my left.  

To maximize points:  
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when there’s less dirt).  
- Cleaning dirt gives no points, but is necessary to enable apple spawning.  
- I can only clean or eat what is directly at my position.  

No information is given about dirt or apples at (8,6). Since apples require clean land, and cleaning dirt doesn’t give points, I must first assess whether there’s dirt here.  

**Action:**  
→ **Clean** (if there is dirt) — this is necessary to enable apple spawning.  
→ If clean, then **Eat** if an apple is present.  

But since I don’t know the state of dirt or apples at (8,6), and I have no information about the river's cleanliness or apple presence, the safest and most logical step is to **clean** — because without cleaning, apples won’t spawn, and I can’t gain points.  

**Final action: clean**.
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Dirt at (8,1).
  Thinking: At (8,0), there is no apple currently. Dirt is at (8,1), which is directly above you.  

Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when there's no dirt), and dirt at (8,1) is not cleaned, the cell (8,1) is still dirty and will not allow apple spawning.  

You cannot eat an apple because there is none at (8,0).  

**Action:** Clean the dirt at (8,1).  
→ This will make the river clean at that location, potentially enabling apple spawning in the future.  

**Reasoning:** Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning. Eating apples gives points, but only if apples are present, which require clean land. Since there's no apple now, and cleaning is required to enable future apple growth, the best move is to clean the dirt.  

**Action: clean** ✅

--- Step 30 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,6). Dirt at (8,7). Agent 2 at (8,6).
  Thinking: At (7,6), there is no apple currently. Dirt is at (8,7), which is not adjacent to your position. You cannot eat an apple unless it's on your cell, and there's no indication of an apple at (7,6).  

To enable apples to spawn, the river must be clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. Since dirt is at (8,7), you need to move there to clean it.  

Current options:  
- Move to (8,7) to clean dirt → necessary to improve apple spawning.  
- Stay at (7,6) → no action yields points.  

**Action: right → move to (8,6)**  
Wait — (8,6) is where Agent 2 is. Can't move there unless it's safe. No info about conflict, but assume agents don’t interfere.  

But (8,7) is dirt — to clean it, you must be on (8,7).  

So:  
- From (7,6), move **right** → (8,6)  
- Then **down** → (8,7) → clean dirt  

But that’s two moves.  

Is there a better path?  

So best action: **eat
  Decision: 'eat' -> Env Action: 'eat'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,4). Dirt at (6,3), (7,3).
  Thinking: At (7,4), you are not on any dirt, so you can't clean. There's dirt at (6,3) and (7,3), but you can only clean dirt if you're on the same cell.  

Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning, if dirt is removed, land becomes available for apples. Since you're not on dirt, you can't clean it directly.  

No apples are currently visible on your cell, and you can't eat anything unless you're on an apple.  

Best action: **move to a dirt cell** (e.g., (7,3)) to clean it.  

**Action: down** → to (8,4)? No dirt there.  
**Action: left** → to (6,4)? No dirt.  
**Action: down** → (8,4), still no dirt.  
**Action: left to (7,3)** → now on (7,3), which has dirt.  

✅ **Action: left** → move to (7,3)  
Then: **clean** → removes dirt at (7,3), contributing to cleaner river → more apples may spawn later.  

**Final action: left, then
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Agent 1 at (7,1).
  Thinking: At (7,0), you are on land. There's no dirt visible, and Agent 1 is at (7,1), which is directly above you. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when there's less dirt), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, we must assess:

- If there's dirt at (7,0), you can clean it to potentially enable apple spawning.
- However, currently, no dirt is mentioned, so we assume the cell is clean or empty.
- Eating apples gives +1.0 each, so if an apple is present, eating it is beneficial.

But: **you are at (7,0)**. Agent 1 is at (7,1), which is above you. There's no indication of apples or dirt at (7,0). Without dirt to clean, apples may not spawn. Also, you cannot eat unless an apple is present.

**Best action: stay**  
Reason: There’s no visible dirt to clean, no apple to eat, and no indication of apple spawning. Moving might expose you to dirt or risk missing a better opportunity. Staying is safe and allows monitoring the situation. If apples appear later (after cleaning), you can

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Agent 3 at (7,0).
  Thinking: At (7,1), I am not on a dirt cell, so I cannot clean. There's no apple visible here either. Agent 3 is at (7,0), directly below me — possibly cleaning or eating, but I can't interact with them.  

No apples are spawning unless the river is clean, and I have no dirt to clean. Since I’m not on dirt, I can’t clean, so no apple spawning occurs.  

Action: **stay**  
Reason: I have no dirt to clean, no apple to eat, and no benefit in moving. Staying is safe and avoids unnecessary movement.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,4). Dirt at (6,5), (6,3), (7,3).
  Thinking: At (6,4), you are not on any dirt, so you can't clean yet. Dirt is at (6,5), (6,3), and (7,3).  

- To clean dirt, you must be on the same cell as the dirt.  
- You can move to (6,5) to clean it, or (6,3), or (7,3).  
- Cleaning dirt doesn't give points, but it makes apples possible later.  
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning when dirt is removed.  

Currently, no apples are visible, so no eating possible.  

Best move: **move down to (7,3)** to clean that dirt.  

**Action: down** → now at (7,3), can clean dirt.  

After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner, increasing chance for apples to spawn on adjacent land.  

**Reasoning**: Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning. Since eating gives +1 point per apple and cleaning gives no points, we must prioritize cleaning to enable future apple spawns.  

👉 **Action: down**
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Agent 1 at (7,1).
  Thinking: At (7,0), you are on land. Agent 1 is at (7,1), directly above you.  

Check surroundings:  
- There's no mention of dirt or apples at (7,0) currently.  
- To eat an apple, the river must be clean (i.e., less dirt), which requires cleaning dirt.  
- Cleaning dirt gives no points, but enables apple spawning.  
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean.  

Since you are at (7,0), and there's no indication of dirt on your cell, you cannot clean dirt here. If there's no dirt, no cleaning is needed.  

But: **You can only eat apples if they are present** — and apples only spawn when the river is clean. Since we don't know the current state of the river or dirt, we must assume it's not clean yet.  

Therefore:  
→ You cannot eat an apple yet (no apple visible).  
→ You cannot clean dirt unless you are on a dirt cell.  

No action gives immediate benefit.  

Best move: **Stay** — to monitor the situation. If dirt is present, you can clean it later. If you move, you might lose opportunity to clean or

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Agent 3 at (7,0).
  Thinking: At (7,1), I am not on a cell with an apple, and there's no indication of dirt to clean. Agent 3 is at (7,0), which is directly below me. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points, I must first assess whether there's dirt to clean here.

Currently, I am at (7,1). If there's dirt here, I can clean it — but that gives no points. If there's no dirt, I can't spawn apples. Since no dirt or apples are mentioned, and I have no information about the state of the cells around me, I should **stay** to avoid moving into an unknown state.

**Action: stay**  
Reasoning: No apples or dirt are visible, and moving without information could lead to wasted steps. Staying at (7,1) allows me to monitor the situation or wait for cleaner conditions.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,3). Dirt at (6,3), (7,3), (8,3).
  Thinking: At (6,3), there is dirt on your cell and adjacent cells: (6,3), (7,3), (8,3).  

Action: **clean**  
Reason: You can only eat apples when the river is clean (i.e., when there's no dirt). Since dirt is present at your current position, you must clean it first to enable apple spawning. Cleaning dirt gives no points, but it's necessary.  

After cleaning (6,3), the dirt is removed — this may allow apples to spawn in the area. Then, you can assess whether to move to adjacent cells to clean more dirt or eat apples.  

**Next step: clean (6,3)**.
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Agent 1 at (7,1).
  Thinking: At (7,0), I am on land. There's no dirt visible, and Agent 1 is at (7,1), which is above me. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when there's less dirt), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I should first check if there's dirt to clean.

However, I am currently at (7,0), and there's no indication of dirt in this cell. If there's no dirt, I can't clean it. Also, apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — but I don't know the state of the river or dirt elsewhere.

Since I can't eat an apple without one being present, and there's no visible apple, and no dirt to clean, I should **stay** to assess the situation.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: No dirt to clean, no apple visible. Need to observe or move to a location where dirt might be present to clean and enable apple spawning.

--- Step 10 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (10,6). Dirt at (8,7), (8,5). Apple at (10,7). Agent 2 at (8,5).
  Thinking: At (10,6):  
- There's an apple at (10,7) — directly to the right.  
- Dirt is at (8,7) and (8,5).  
- Agent 2 is at (8,5), which has dirt — possibly blocking or occupying that spot.  
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned).  
- Cleaning dirt gives no points, but is necessary for apples to appear.  

Current situation:  
- I can **move to (10,7)** to eat the apple.  
- But to eat apples, the river must be clean — currently, dirt exists at (8,7) and (8,5).  
- I am at (10,6), so I cannot clean (8,7) or (8,5) directly.  
- I can only clean dirt **on my current cell**.  

So:  
- I am not on any dirt cell.  
- I can't clean (8,7) or (8,5) from (10,6).  
- Therefore, apples cannot spawn (since river isn't clean).  

But there's an apple at (10,7
  Decision: 'eat' -> Env Action: 'eat'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,5). Dirt at (8,5), (7,4). Agent 1 at (10,6).
  Thinking: At (8,5), there is dirt on your cell. You can clean it. Cleaning dirt gives no points directly, but it's necessary to enable apple spawning. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt), cleaning now will help create conditions for apples to appear.

Currently, there's no apple visible, and apples only spawn *after* dirt is cleaned. So, first action: **clean**.

After cleaning (8,5), the dirt is gone. Now, the land at (8,5) is clear. But apples still need to spawn — they don't appear instantly. However, with less dirt, the environment becomes more favorable.

There's also dirt at (7,4), but you can't reach it yet. You must move to clean it later if needed.

Right now, no apple is available to eat.

**Action: clean**.  
(Reason: Cleaning dirt is required to enable apple spawning. Without cleaning, no apples can spawn. Eating is not possible yet.)
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (7,2), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (8,1), you are not on any dirt, so you can't clean. There's no apple visible at your position.  

Dirt is at (7,2) and (6,0) — both are not adjacent to you. You can only clean dirt if you're on the same cell. Since you're at (8,1), you can't clean those dirt cells directly.  

Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. But since you can't reach the dirt cells from your current position without moving, you can't clean them yet.  

**Best action: move toward a dirt cell to clean it.**  
→ Move left to (7,1), then possibly to (7,2) to clean dirt.  

**Plan:**  
- Move left to (7,1)  
- Then move up to (7,2) to clean dirt  
- After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner → apples may spawn on land  
- Then return to (8,1) to eat apples

--- Step 11 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (10,6). Dirt at (8,7). Apple at (10,7). Agent 2 at (8,5).
  Thinking: At (10,6):  
- There's an apple at (10,7) — directly to the south.  
- There's dirt at (8,7) — not adjacent to current position.  
- Agent 2 is at (8,5), which is irrelevant unless blocking or competing (no rules mention conflict).  

**Action analysis:**  
- Can't eat the apple at (10,7) yet because not on that cell.  
- Dirt is at (8,7), not adjacent to (10,6) — cannot clean it directly.  
- Must move to get to (10,7) to eat the apple.  

**Best immediate move:**  
→ **Right** to (10,7) to eat the apple (+1.0 point).  

**Why?**  
- Eating an apple gives points.  
- Cleaning dirt gives no points but enables apple spawning.  
- Apples only spawn when river is clean — but currently, there's no indication the river is dirty or that cleaning is needed.  
- The apple is available and directly reachable.  

✅ **Action: right** (to (10,7)) → then **eat**.  

**Final decision:** right
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,5). Dirt at (7,4). Agent 1 at (10,6).
  Thinking: At (8,5), there is dirt at (7,4), which is not adjacent to you. You cannot clean dirt that is not on your current cell. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, but since dirt is not directly on your position, you cannot clean it yet.

Available actions:
- **Move** to a neighboring cell to get closer to dirt (e.g., move to (7,5) or (8,4)) — but no immediate apple or dirt to clean.
- **Stay** — no dirt here, so no clean action.
- **Eat** — no apple present at (8,5), so cannot eat.

**Best action: move left to (7,5)** to get closer to the dirt at (7,4), so you can eventually clean it.

**Reasoning**: Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning. Since dirt is at (7,4), moving to (7,5) puts you adjacent to it. From there, you can clean the dirt (if you reach it), which may allow apples to spawn later. Currently, no apples or clean land exists, so no points can be gained. Prioritize cleaning dirt to enable future apple harvesting.

→ **Action: left
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Dirt at (7,2), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (7,1), you are not on any dirt, so you can't clean. There's dirt at (7,2) and (6,0), but you can only clean if you're on a cell with dirt.  

Currently, no apple is mentioned, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned). Since there's no apple visible and you're not on dirt, you can't eat or clean.  

**Best action: move to (7,2)** — to clean the dirt there, which will help make the river cleaner and potentially enable apple spawning.  

**Reasoning:** Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apples to spawn, even though it gives no points. Without cleaning, no apples appear. Moving to (7,2) allows you to clean and progress toward apple spawning.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (11,6). Apple at (10,7).
  Thinking: At (11,6), there's an apple at (10,7). To eat it, I need to move to (10,7).  

Path:  
- From (11,6) to (10,6) → left  
- Then from (10,6) to (10,7) → up  

This takes two moves.  

But: **I can only eat apples if I'm on the same cell as the apple**. So I must move to (10,7) first.  

No dirt is mentioned, so no cleaning needed.  

✅ Action: Move left to (10,6), then up to (10,7), then eat.  

**Final action sequence**:  
left → up → eat  

**Reasoning**: I need to reach the apple’s location to eat it. Movement is required, and eating only happens when on the apple. No cleaning needed here.  

→ **Eat the apple for +1.0 point**.
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Dirt at (7,4).
  Thinking: At (7,5), there is no apple visible. Dirt is at (7,4), which is directly below you. Since you can only clean dirt when on your current cell, you cannot clean (7,4) from (7,5).  

To clean the dirt at (7,4), you must move to (7,4) first.  

**Action: down** to (7,4)  
Then, **clean** the dirt.  

Cleaning dirt does not give points, but it enables apple spawning on land (which is necessary to eat apples). After cleaning, if apples spawn (which depends on overall river cleanliness), you may later eat them.  

**Reasoning:** You must move to the dirt cell to clean it. Without cleaning, no apples can spawn. So, prioritize cleaning dirt to enable apple spawning.  

**Next step: down** → **clean**.
Next step: After cleaning, check surroundings for apples or dirt.

--- Step 23 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,3). Dirt at (7,3), (7,2).
  Thinking: At (7,3), there is dirt, so I can clean it. Cleaning dirt does not give points, but it's necessary to enable apples to spawn. After cleaning (7,3), the river becomes cleaner in that area, which may allow apples to spawn later.  

Currently, there's no apple at (7,3), and no apple information is given. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, cleaning the dirt is essential.  

**Action: clean**  
→ This prepares the environment for potential apple spawning. I cannot eat yet, as there's no apple.  

**Reasoning:** Cleaning dirt is required to enable apple spawning. Without cleaning, no apples will appear. I must clean first.
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,5). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,5), nothing is visible. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first check if there's dirt to clean. Without any visible items, I cannot confirm if there's dirt or an apple.  

**Action: stay**  
Reason: I need to assess the current state of the cell. If there's dirt, I must clean it to enable apple spawning. Since nothing is visible, staying allows me to monitor the environment and possibly detect changes or receive updates. Moving without information could lead to missing critical actions.  

**Next step:** Wait for more information or detect surroundings.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apples to spawn, the river must be clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. However, cleaning dirt gives no points, only enables apple spawning.

Since you're at (7,0) and see nothing, it's likely your current cell is either clean or has no dirt visible. Without dirt to clean, apples won't spawn.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: You have no visible dirt or apples. Cleaning is only useful if dirt exists, and without sight of dirt, cleaning is unnecessary. Staying allows you to monitor the environment or move to a better position where dirt or apples might be.  

→ **Final action: stay**

--- Step 24 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,3). Dirt at (6,3), (7,2).
  Thinking: At (7,3), I see dirt at (6,3) and (7,2). I can only clean dirt or eat apples from my current position.

- I am not on any dirt cells, so I cannot clean dirt right now.
- There are no apples mentioned, so I cannot eat one either.

To enable apple spawning, I need to clean dirt. The dirt is at (6,3) and (7,2), so I must move to one of those cells to clean.

**Best action: Move to (7,2)** — I can clean dirt there, which helps make the river cleaner and enables apples to spawn later.

**Reasoning**: Cleaning dirt is necessary to allow apples to spawn. Since I can't eat anything now, I must first clean dirt to progress. Moving to (7,2) is directly adjacent and allows me to clean immediately.

Action: **down** (to move from (7,3) to (7,2))
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,5). Dirt at (6,6).
  Thinking: You are at (8,5). Dirt is at (6,6).  

To clean the dirt at (6,6), you must move there first.  
Currently, you are at (8,5), so the shortest path to (6,6) is:  
- Move left to (7,5)  
- Move up to (6,5)  
- Move up to (6,6)  

Once you reach (6,6), you can clean the dirt.  

Cleaning dirt gives no points, but it’s necessary to enable apple spawning on land. After cleaning, if apples spawn (which depends on overall river cleanliness), you may be able to eat them for +1.0 points.  

**Action: left → up → up → clean**  

(Then, if apples appear later, you can eat them when on their cell.)  

**Reasoning:** You must clean the dirt to enable apple spawning. You can't eat apples unless the river is clean, and you can't reach the dirt without moving. So, move to (6,6) and clean.  

**Next step: clean at (6,6).**
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first determine whether there's dirt to clean.

However, since nothing is visible and you're at (7,0), it's possible you're on a land cell with no dirt or apples currently. Without any visible items, you cannot eat an apple or clean dirt.

**Best action: stay**  
Reasoning: You have no information about dirt or apples nearby. Moving blindly could lead you away from potential resources. Staying allows you to assess the situation or wait for new information (e.g., if dirt or apples appear later). Since no action yields immediate benefit, staying is the safest and most logical choice.

--- Step 25 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Dirt at (6,3), (7,2).
  Thinking: At (7,2), you are on a cell with dirt. There's also dirt at (6,3).  

- You can **clean** dirt only if you are on the same cell.  
- Cleaning dirt gives no points, but it's necessary to enable apples to spawn.  
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt).  

Currently, you are on (7,2), which has dirt. You can **clean** that dirt to reduce the total dirt and possibly enable apple spawning.  

**Action: clean**  

Reasoning: Cleaning dirt at (7,2) reduces the total dirt, which may allow apples to spawn on land later. Since eating apples gives +1.0 points and cleaning dirt doesn't give points but enables future apple spawning, cleaning is necessary for long-term point gain.  

→ **Action: clean**
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Dirt at (6,6).
  Thinking: At (7,5), you are not on dirt, so you can't clean it directly. Dirt is at (6,6), which is not adjacent to your current position. To clean dirt, you must move to the cell with dirt first.

Action: **move left** to (6,5) → still not on (6,6).  
Then **move up** to (5,6) → still not on (6,6).  
Then **move right** to (7,6) → still not on (6,6).  
Then **move up** to (6,6) → now you are on the dirt.

Now you can **clean** the dirt at (6,6). Cleaning it contributes to a cleaner river, which may enable apples to spawn later — but cleaning itself gives 0 points.

After cleaning, you can then move back or explore for apples.

**Current best action: move up to (6,6), then clean.**

→ **Action: up** (to (6,6))  
→ **Action: clean**  

This is necessary to enable future apple spawning. No points are earned from cleaning, but it's essential for apples to appear.
  Decision: 'up' -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apple spawning, the river must be clean—meaning dirt must be cleaned. However, cleaning dirt gives no points, only enables apples to spawn later.

Since you're at (7,0) and see nothing, it's likely your current cell may have dirt or be adjacent to dirt. Without visibility, you must explore.

**Action: right**  
→ Move to (8,0) to check the next cell. This is a logical first step to explore and possibly find dirt or apples.  

Next step: Explore.
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,0), nothing is visible, so I don't know if there's dirt or an apple. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first check if there's dirt to clean.

But with no visible items, I cannot confirm if dirt is present. Without knowing the state of the cell, I cannot safely clean or eat.

Best action: **stay** — to remain in position and assess the situation further. If anything appears, I can act accordingly.

**Action: stay**

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,2), nothing is visible, so I don't know if there's dirt or an apple. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when there's dirt cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I need to first check if there's dirt to clean.

However, with no visible items, I cannot confirm whether dirt exists at (7,2). Without knowing the state of the cell, I cannot safely clean or eat.

**Best action: stay**  
Reason: I don't have information about the environment. Staying allows me to assess the situation further. If dirt is present, I can clean it later. If not, I can explore. Moving without information might lead to wasted actions.  

**Action: stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,5). Dirt at (7,5).
  Thinking: At (5,5), there is no apple visible, and the only dirt is at (7,5), which is to the right. Since I can only clean dirt or eat apples when I am on the same cell, I cannot clean (7,5) from (5,5).

To clean dirt, I must move to (7,5). So:

**Action: right** → move to (7,5)

Now I am at (7,5), where dirt is.  
**Action: clean** → clean the dirt at (7,5). This has no points, but it makes the river cleaner, potentially enabling apples to spawn on nearby land.

After cleaning, if the river becomes clean, apples may spawn on adjacent land cells (e.g., (6,5), (8,5), etc.), but since no apple is mentioned, and I’m not on land yet, I cannot eat.

Next step: After cleaning, I should check if apples now spawn. But currently, no apple is indicated.

**Best next move: stay** (or possibly move to adjacent land to check for apples).

But since no apple is present and I just cleaned dirt, the only action that gains value is cleaning to enable future apple spawning.
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,0), nothing is visible. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first check if there's dirt to clean. With no visible items, I cannot eat an apple.  

Action: **stay**  
Reason: No visible dirt or apples. Staying allows me to assess the environment safely before taking any action. If dirt appears later, I can clean it. Without any information, I cannot proceed.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,2), nothing is visible. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first check if there's dirt to clean. Without any visible items, I cannot eat an apple.  

Action: **stay**  
Reason: I need to assess my surroundings first. Without knowing if there's dirt or an apple, I cannot take action. Staying allows me to gather more information or react when something appears.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,5). Dirt at (7,5).
  Thinking: You are at (6,5). There is dirt at (7,5), which is to your right.  

Since you can only clean dirt or eat apples **at your current position**, you cannot clean the dirt at (7,5) right now.  

There is no apple mentioned at your position, so you cannot eat one yet.  

**Action: right** to move to (7,5) and clean the dirt there.  

After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner (dirt reduced), which may allow apples to spawn in the future — but only if apples spawn on land when the river is clean.  

**Reasoning:** Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning, and you must be on the cell with dirt to clean it. Moving to (7,5) and cleaning it is the best next step.  

✅ Action: **right** then **clean**.
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first determine whether there is dirt to clean.

However, with nothing in view, it's likely that you are on a land cell with no visible dirt or apples. To enable apple spawning, you must clean dirt — but you can only clean dirt if it's on your current cell.

Since nothing is visible, it's possible that there is no dirt here, or you just don't see it. Without confirmation, **you cannot eat** (no apple), and **you cannot clean** (no dirt to clean).

Therefore, the safest action is to **stay** — to maintain position and assess the surroundings. You may need to move to discover dirt or apples.

**Action: stay**.

--- Step 22 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,2), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apple spawning, you must first clean dirt — but there's no dirt visible. 

Action: **stay**  
Reason: Without sight of dirt or apples, you can't act productively. Staying allows you to observe or move strategically when new information becomes available. Cleaning or eating is not possible right now.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Dirt at (7,5).
  Thinking: You are at (7,5), and there is dirt at your position.  

Action: **clean**  
Reason: You can only eat apples when there's clean land, and apples spawn on clean land. Since there's dirt here, you must clean it first to make space for apples. Cleaning dirt gives no points, but it's necessary to enable apple spawning.  

After cleaning, you'll be on clean land at (7,5), and apples may spawn there (though spawning depends on overall river cleanliness, which isn't fully specified).  

Next step: After cleaning, consider if you should stay or move to explore other areas for more apples. But currently, the best immediate action is to clean.  

✅ Action: **clean**
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately.  

**Reasoning**:  
- To eat apples, there must be an apple on the grid, which only spawns when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned).  
- You currently have no sight of dirt or apples, so you cannot perform a clean or eat action.  
- Without cleaning dirt, apples won’t spawn.  

**Action**: *Stay* — to remain at (6,0) and assess the environment. If you can see dirt or apples later, you can act accordingly.  

**Next step**: Look around (explore) to detect dirt or apples. But since nothing is visible, no action is possible now.  

→ **Stay**.
  Obs: You at (7,1). Agent 3 at (7,0).
  Thinking: At (7,1), you are on land. Agent 3 is at (7,0), directly below you.  

Currently, there's no mention of dirt or apples in the environment. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points, we must first determine whether there's dirt to clean.  

If there is dirt at (7,1), you can clean it — but that doesn’t give points. Only after cleaning dirt can apples spawn, and then you can eat them.  

However, since no dirt or apple is mentioned, and you are on land, it's possible that the river is currently clean (or no dirt exists), so apples might already be available.  

But: **You can only eat apples if they are present on your cell.**  

No information confirms an apple is at (7,1).  

**Best action: stay** — to monitor the situation. If apples appear later (after cleaning), you can eat them. Cleaning dirt is only useful if dirt is present and you need to enable apple spawning.  

→ **Action: stay**  
(Reason: No dirt or apple is confirmed. Cleaning is not beneficial without dirt. Eating is not possible
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,3). Dirt at (7,3), (8,3).
  Thinking: At (6,3), I see dirt at (7,3) and (8,3). I am not on any dirt, so I cannot clean it yet. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning I need to clean the dirt to enable apples.  

Since I can only clean dirt when I'm on a cell with dirt, I must move to (7,3) or (8,3) to clean it.  

Let’s consider:  
- Moving to (7,3): I can clean it. Then, if I move to (8,3), I can clean that too.  
- Cleaning dirt gives no points, but enables apple spawning.  
- Apples give +1.0 each, so I want to maximize apple access.  

Best path:  
1. Move right to (7,3) → clean dirt (no points).  
2. Move right to (8,3) → clean dirt (no points).  
Now the river is clean, and apples may spawn on land (though spawning isn’t explicitly triggered, the rule implies clean river = apples possible).  

Since I’m now on (8,3), and no apples are mentioned, I must assume they appear only after cleaning
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Agent 1 at (7,1).
  Thinking: At (7,0), I am on land. There's no apple visible, and Agent 1 is at (7,1), which is directly above me.  

Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and I currently have no dirt to clean, I cannot spawn apples.  

I must first consider:  
- Can I clean dirt? Only if I'm on a cell with dirt.  
- Do I know if (7,0) has dirt? Not stated.  

But since there's no apple and no dirt mentioned, and I’m at (7,0), I assume this cell may be clean or have dirt. Without confirmation, I cannot eat.  

Best action: **Stay** — to assess whether dirt is present or if I should move to check surroundings.  

**Reasoning**: Without dirt to clean, no apples can spawn. Eating is not possible. I need to confirm if dirt exists at (7,0) before cleaning. Staying allows observation.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Agent 3 at (7,0).
  Thinking: At (7,1), I am on land. Agent 3 is at (7,0), directly below me.  

There's no mention of dirt or apples currently. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first assess whether there's dirt to clean.  

No dirt is mentioned, and no apple is visible. Therefore, I cannot eat an apple.  

**Best action: stay**  
Reason: Without knowing if there's dirt to clean or apples to eat, and since I'm already on land, I should stay to monitor the situation. If dirt is present, I can clean it; if apples appear later, I can eat them. Moving might lead to inefficiency.  

**Final action: stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,3). Dirt at (7,3), (8,3).
  Thinking: At (7,3), there is dirt. I can clean it. Cleaning dirt does not give points, but it's necessary to enable apples to spawn. After cleaning (7,3), the river will be cleaner, potentially allowing apples to spawn. However, since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and I currently have no apples, I should first clean the dirt to improve conditions.

Action: **clean** (at (7,3))  
Then, I can check if apples appear or if I need to move to other dirt cells. But based on current info, cleaning is necessary.

**Next step: clean**.
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Agent 1 at (7,1).
  Thinking: At (7,0), you are on land. Agent 1 is at (7,1), directly above you.  

First, check if there's an apple to eat. There's no information that an apple is present at (7,0), so we cannot eat yet.  

Now, consider the river's cleanliness: apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Since we don’t know the current state of the river, we must assume it may not be clean yet. Cleaning dirt is necessary to improve river cleanliness and enable apple spawning — but cleaning gives no points.  

Since you're at (7,0), and there's no indication of dirt at your current position, you cannot clean unless dirt is present.  

No apple is visible, and no dirt is mentioned. Therefore, **the best action is to stay** — no benefit in moving or cleaning without information.  

**Action: stay**.  

(If dirt were present, clean would be better; if an apple were present, eat would be better. But currently, no such item is indicated.)

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Agent 3 at (7,0).
  Thinking: At (7,1), I am not on a dirt cell, and there's no visible apple. Agent 3 is at (7,0), which is directly below me. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points, I need to assess whether there's dirt nearby to clean.

Currently, I’m at (7,1). If there's dirt at (7,1), I can clean it — but that gives no points. If there's an apple at (7,1), I can eat it and gain +1.0.

No information suggests an apple is present. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and I have no confirmation of dirt at (7,1), I cannot assume an apple exists.

Best action: **stay** — to monitor the situation. If dirt is present, I can clean it later; if an apple appears, I can eat it.

→ **Action: stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,3). Dirt at (8,3).
  Thinking: You are at (7,3). There is dirt at (8,3), which is to your right.  

Since you can only clean dirt or eat apples **at your current position**, you cannot clean the dirt at (8,3) right now.  

There is no apple mentioned at your position, so you cannot eat one yet.  

**Action: right** → move to (8,3) to clean the dirt there.  

After cleaning, the dirt is gone, and if the river becomes clean (i.e., less dirt), apples might spawn — but only if they spawn on land. Since we don’t have apple spawn info, we assume apples only appear when the river is clean.  

**Reasoning:** Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning. You must first clean the dirt at (8,3) to improve the river's cleanliness.  

✅ Action: **right** → move to (8,3) and clean.
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Agent 1 at (7,1).
  Thinking: At (7,0), you are on land. Agent 1 is at (7,1), directly above you. There's no mention of dirt or apples currently.  

Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when there's less dirt), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, we must first assess whether there's dirt to clean.  

However, no dirt is mentioned, and you're not on a cell with dirt. Without dirt, there's no need to clean.  

But if there are no apples present, and no dirt to clean, then you can't gain points.  

Best action: **stay** — to monitor the situation. If dirt appears or apples spawn later, you can act.  

**Reasoning**: No dirt to clean, no apples visible. Moving or cleaning is unnecessary. Stay to assess future changes.  

(7,6
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,6). Dirt at (8,7). Agent 1 at (7,6).
  Thinking: At (8,6), there is dirt at (8,7) directly below you. Since you can only clean dirt when on your current cell, you must first **move down to (8,7)** to clean it. Cleaning dirt does not give points, but it is necessary to improve the river's cleanliness and enable apple spawning.

After cleaning (8,7), the river becomes cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn on adjacent land cells. However, currently, there's no apple visible at (8,6) or nearby.

**Action: down** (to clean dirt at (8,7)).

Once cleaned, you can assess if apples have appeared and consider whether to move to a land cell with apples to eat them. But currently, the best immediate action is to clean the dirt.  

✅ Reasoning: Cleaning is required to enable apple spawning; no points are gained from cleaning, but it's a necessary step.
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Dirt at (8,1).
  Thinking: At (8,0), there is no apple currently. Dirt is at (8,1), which is directly above you. Since you can only clean dirt if you are on the same cell, you cannot clean the dirt at (8,1) from (8,0).  

To clean dirt, you must move to the cell where the dirt is. So, move **up** to (8,1) to clean the dirt.  

After cleaning, the river will be cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn (though spawning isn't directly observable here). But since no apples are visible and no apple spawn rule is triggered by just cleaning, and we can't eat anything now, the best immediate action is:  

**Action: up** (to reach (8,1) and clean the dirt).  

This is necessary to enable future apple spawning. Cleaning itself gives no points, but it's required to enable apples.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,6). Dirt at (8,7). Agent 2 at (8,5).
  Thinking: At (8,6), there is dirt at (8,7) directly below you. Agent 2 is at (8,5), above you, so they are not in your immediate vicinity.

**Action Plan:**
- You can **clean** the dirt at (8,7) only if you are on that cell. Since you are at (8,6), you cannot clean (8,7) directly.
- To clean dirt, you must move to the cell with dirt.
- Therefore, you must **move down to (8,7)** to clean it.

**Reasoning:**
- Cleaning dirt is necessary to make the river clean, which enables apples to spawn.
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — so cleaning is a prerequisite for gaining points via apples.
- Eating apples gives +1.0 each, but only if they are present (which depends on cleanliness).

**Next step: move down to (8,7) to clean the dirt.**

✅ Action: **down**
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,5). Dirt at (7,4). Agent 1 at (8,6).
  Thinking: At (8,5), there is no apple visible, and the only dirt is at (7,4), which is not adjacent to your position. You cannot clean dirt at (7,4) unless you move there. Since you can only clean dirt when on your current cell, and there's no dirt at your position, you cannot clean anything now.

Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — but since there's no dirt at your location, and no indication of a river, we assume the current state doesn't allow apple spawning.

Best action: **move to (7,4)** to clean the dirt there, which will improve the river's cleanliness and potentially allow apples to spawn later.

**Action: left** (to move from (8,5) to (7,5)), then possibly down or left to reach (7,4). But directly from (8,5), left is to (7,5), not (7,4). So:

- To reach (7,4): move **left** to (7,5), then **down** to (8,4)? No — (7,4) is left and down from (8,5).

From (8,5):  
- Left →
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (6,2), (7,2), (8,1).
  Thinking: At (8,1), you see dirt at (6,2), (7,2), and (8,1). You can only clean dirt if you are on the same cell. So, you are on (8,1), which has dirt — you can **clean** it.

Cleaning (8,1) removes dirt from that cell, which may help future apple spawning (since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean). However, cleaning gives **no points**.

There is no apple at (8,1) currently — apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and we don't have info on apple locations yet.

So, best action: **clean** to remove dirt at (8,1), enabling potential apple spawning later.

**Action: clean**.

--- Step 32 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,5). Dirt at (7,4). Agent 2 at (7,5).
  Thinking: At (8,5), there is dirt at (7,4), which is not directly adjacent. Agent 2 is at (7,5), so they are nearby but not on the same cell.

To maximize points:
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned).
- Cleaning dirt gives no points, but is necessary for apples to appear.
- You can only clean or eat what is directly on your current cell.

Since dirt is at (7,4), and you are at (8,5), you must move to (7,4) to clean it. But you can’t clean it from (8,5) — only from the cell where the dirt is.

So:
- Move to (7,4) to clean the dirt (this will make the river cleaner, enabling apples to spawn on land).
- After cleaning, if apples spawn on land, you can later eat them if you move to those cells.

But currently, there’s no apple visible. So the best immediate action is to **move left and down to (7,4)** to clean the dirt.

**Action: left, then down** (to reach (7,4)) → clean.

After cleaning, the area
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Dirt at (7,4). Agent 1 at (8,5).
  Thinking: At (7,5), there is dirt at (7,4) directly below you. Since you can only clean dirt when you are on the same cell, you must move to (7,4) to clean it. Cleaning dirt doesn't give points, but it helps improve the river's cleanliness, which increases the chance of apples spawning on land — which you can then eat for +1.0 points each.

Agent 1 is at (8,5), which is to your right — no immediate threat or benefit noted.

**Action: move down to (7,4)**  
→ Clean the dirt.  
→ This improves river cleanliness, enabling future apple spawning.  
→ After cleaning, you can then move to adjacent land cells (if any) to potentially eat apples.

**Reasoning**: Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apples to spawn. Without cleaning, no apples can appear. Since apples are the only source of points, and cleaning gives no direct benefit, it's essential to prioritize cleaning dirt when possible.  

**Next step after cleaning**: Look for nearby land cells (e.g., (7,6), (6,5), etc.) to see if apples have appeared. If not, continue cleaning or moving strategically.  

✅ Action: **
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (6,2), (7,2).
  Thinking: At (8,1), you are not on any dirt, so you can't clean it yet. Dirt is at (6,2) and (7,2), which are not adjacent to you. To clean dirt, you must move to a cell with dirt and then use "clean". 

Currently, there are no apples visible, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned). Since you're not on dirt, you can't clean it yet. 

Best action: **move left** to (7,1), then possibly to (7,2) to clean the dirt at (7,2).  

**Reasoning**: Cleaning dirt enables apple spawning, which gives points. Since eating apples gives +1.0 each and cleaning dirt gives no points, but is necessary to enable apple spawning, we must prioritize cleaning dirt.  

**Next step**: Move to (7,2) to clean it.  

→ Action: **left** (to (7,1)), then **down** (to (7,2)) → then **clean**.

--- Step 23 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Dirt at (8,2).
  Thinking: You are at (7,2). There is dirt at (8,2), which is to your right.  

Action: **right**  
→ Move to (8,2) to clean the dirt.  

Reasoning: You can only clean dirt or eat apples *at your current position*. Since there's dirt at (8,2) and you're at (7,2), you must move there to clean it. Cleaning dirt doesn't give points, but it's necessary to improve the river's cleanliness, which in turn enables apples to spawn on land. Without cleaning, no apples will appear.  

Next step: After cleaning, you can assess whether apples have now spawned (though not visible here), and then decide whether to eat them.  

**Action: right** (to move to (8,2) and clean dirt).
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,5), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apple spawning, you must first clean dirt. However, without knowing what’s around you (like dirt or apples), you can’t act directly.

**Reasoning**: You need to explore to find dirt to clean, which in turn enables apples to spawn. Since nothing is visible, the best next step is to **move** in a direction to explore the environment and locate dirt.

**Action**: left
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean yet. To progress, you must first check your surroundings to find dirt (to clean) or apples (to eat).  

**Action: stay**  
Reasoning: Staying allows you to remain in a position where you can later detect or interact with terrain. Without movement, you can't explore and may miss opportunities. However, since nothing is visible, moving might reveal dirt or apples.  

But — since nothing is visible and you have no information about surroundings, **staying is safest** to avoid moving into a potentially unproductive area.  

👉 **Final action: stay**

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,2). Dirt at (8,2).
  Thinking: You are at (8,2), and there is dirt at your position.  

Action: **clean**  
Reasoning: You can only clean dirt when you're on it. Cleaning dirt is necessary to make apples spawn, but eating dirt gives no points. Since apples only spawn on clean land, cleaning the dirt at (8,2) will enable potential apple spawning in that cell. After cleaning, you can consider eating an apple if one appears.  

→ Do **clean**.
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,5). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,5), nothing is visible. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first check if there's dirt to clean. Without any visible items, I cannot eat an apple.  

Action: **clean** (if dirt is present), or **stay** to assess the situation.  

But since nothing is visible and no dirt is reported, I assume no dirt is present. Therefore, no apple can spawn.  

Conclusion: **stay** — wait for more information or potential dirt to appear.  

Final action: **stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first determine if there's dirt to clean.

However, with nothing in view, it's likely that either:
- You are on clean land (no dirt to clean), or
- Dirt is present but not visible (possibly off-grid or hidden).

But since apples only spawn *when the river is clean*, and cleaning dirt is required, you need to check your current cell.

**Action: clean**  
→ If there's dirt, cleaning it will make the area clean and potentially allow apples to spawn later.  
→ If there's no dirt, cleaning gives no benefit but doesn't harm.

Since you have no information about dirt or apples, and you can't eat anything yet, the safest and most strategic step is to **clean** your current cell to enable future apple spawning.

**Reasoning:** Without cleaning, apples won’t spawn. Cleaning is necessary groundwork. Eating now is not possible. Therefore, **clean**.

--- Step 25 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,2), nothing is visible, so I don't know if there's dirt or an apple. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first check if there's dirt to clean.  

However, with no view and no known items, I cannot confirm if dirt is present. Without information about surroundings, the safest action is to **stay** and assess the situation further.  

**Action: stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,5). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,5), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first check if there's dirt to clean. Without any visible items, it's likely the cell is clean or empty.

However, since apples require a clean river (i.e., dirt cleaned), and you can only clean dirt *on your cell*, you must first determine whether there is dirt at (6,5).

Given that nothing is visible, it's safest to **assume there is no dirt** (otherwise you would see it). Therefore, no apples can spawn here, and you cannot gain points from eating.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: No visible dirt or apples. Cleaning or eating is not possible. Staying allows you to assess the environment further if new information becomes available.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately.  

First, check if there's dirt to clean — but since nothing is visible, it's likely there's no dirt here. Without dirt, apples won't spawn.  

To enable apple spawning, you need to clean dirt. But you can only clean dirt *on your current cell*.  

Since nothing is visible, assume there's no dirt here. Therefore, you cannot clean or eat.  

Best action: **stay** — to keep monitoring your position. If dirt appears or you get a view of something, you can act.  

→ **Action: stay**.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,2), with nothing in view, I cannot see any apples or dirt. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when there's dirt to clean), and I can only clean or eat what's directly at my position, I must first determine if there's dirt to clean.

But since nothing is visible, and I have no information about the state of the cell (dirt or apple), I cannot assume either.

Action: **stay**  
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (7,2), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (8,1), you are not on any dirt, so you can't clean. There's no apple visible at your position.  

Dirt is at (7,2) and (6,0) — both are not adjacent to you. So you can't clean them directly.  

Apples only spawn when the river is clean — but since you can't clean dirt unless you're on it, you can't clean those cells.  

Therefore, **you cannot eat any apples right now**, and **you cannot clean dirt from your current position**.  

**Best action: stay** — to keep monitoring the situation. If dirt is cleaned later (e.g., by moving to it), you can then clean and eventually enable apple spawning.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (10,6). Dirt at (8,7). Apple at (10,7).
  Thinking: At (10,6):  
- There's an apple at (10,7), which is directly to the right.  
- There's dirt at (8,7), which is not adjacent to you.  

You can only **clean dirt** or **eat apples** if you are on the same cell.  

Currently, you are at (10,6), not on (10,7) or (8,7).  

✅ You can **move right** to (10,7) to eat the apple.  
❌ You cannot clean dirt at (8,7) from (10,6) — it's not adjacent.  

**Action: right**  
→ Move to (10,7), then eat the apple.  

**Reasoning**: Eating the apple gives +1.0 point. Cleaning dirt gives no points but is needed for future apple spawning. Since an apple is available immediately and reachable, eating it is optimal now.  

**Final action: right, then eat**.
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,4). Dirt at (7,4).
  Thinking: You are at (7,4), and there is dirt at your position.  

Action: **clean**  
Reason: You can only eat apples when there is clean land, and apples only spawn on clean land. Since there is dirt here, you must clean it first to enable apple spawning. Cleaning dirt gives no points directly, but it's necessary to allow apples to appear. After cleaning, you can potentially eat an apple if one spawns.  

→ Do **clean**.
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (7,2), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (8,1), you are not on any dirt, so you can't clean. There's no apple visible at your position. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — currently, dirt is at (7,2) and (6,0), so the river is not clean yet.

To enable apple spawning, you must clean dirt. But you can only clean dirt when you are on the same cell as it. So:

- You need to move to (7,2) or (6,0) to clean dirt.
- Cleaning dirt gives no points, but makes the river cleaner and enables apples to spawn on land.

Best action: **move left to (7,1)** — closer to (7,2), then eventually clean (7,2). From there, you can continue to clean (6,0) if needed.

**Action: left**  
(Reason: To reach dirt at (7,2) to clean it and eventually enable apple spawning.)

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (11,6). Apple at (10,7).
  Thinking: At (11,6), there's an apple at (10,7). To eat it, I need to move to (10,7).  

Step-by-step:  
- Current position: (11,6)  
- Apple is at (10,7) → one step left and one step down from current position.  
- So, move **left** to (11,7), then **down** to (12,7)? Wait — (10,7) is left and up from (11,6).  

Correct path:  
- From (11,6), move **left** to (10,6), then **up** to (10,7).  

But: I can only eat apples when I’m on the same cell. So I must move to (10,7).  

Path:  
1. Move **left** to (10,6)  
2. Move **up** to (10,7) → now on apple  

Now I can **eat** the apple (+1.0 point).  

No dirt to clean here. Apple is on land, so river is clean (assumed).  

✅ Action: Move left →
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,4). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,4), nothing is visible. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first check if there's dirt to clean. Without visibility, I cannot determine if there's dirt or an apple.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: I need to assess the current state of my cell. If there's dirt, I can clean it to enable apples to spawn. If there's an apple, I can eat it. Since nothing is visible, staying allows me to evaluate the situation without moving.  

→ **Stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Dirt at (7,2), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (7,1), you are not on any dirt, so you can't clean. There's dirt at (7,2) and (6,0), but you can only clean dirt if you're on the same cell.  

Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. Since you're at (7,1), you can't clean (7,2) or (6,0) directly.  

**Best action: move to (7,2)** to clean the dirt there.  

→ **Action: right** (to move to (7,2))  
Then, once there, **clean** the dirt.  

This will help clean the river, enabling apples to spawn in the future.  

**Reasoning**: Cleaning dirt is necessary to allow apples to spawn, even though it gives no points. Without cleaning, no apples can appear. You must first move to a dirt cell to clean it.  

✅ Next step: clean (7,2).  

**Action: right** (to (7,2)) → then **clean**.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (10,6). Dirt at (8,7). Apple at (10,7).
  Thinking: At (10,6), you see an apple at (10,7) — directly above you. However, there's dirt at (8,7), which is not at your current position. Since you can only clean dirt *at your position*, and you're not on (8,7), you cannot clean that dirt directly.

But apples only spawn when the river is clean — implying that dirt removal in the river area (or relevant zones) enables apple spawning. Since the dirt is at (8,7), and you're at (10,6), you need to reach (8,7) to clean it — but you can't clean dirt unless you're on that cell.

So, current options:

- **Move to (8,7)**: You can go left or down to get there. From (10,6), move left to (10,5), then left again to (10,4), etc., or go up/down to reach (8,7). But (8,7) is not adjacent — you need to move to it.

Wait: (10,6) to (8,7) is diagonal? No — only orthogonal moves.

From (10,6), to reach
  Decision: 'eat' -> Env Action: 'eat'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,4). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,4), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apples to spawn, the river must be clean—so dirt must be cleaned. However, cleaning only gives no points, but is necessary.

Since you can’t see anything, you must explore to find dirt to clean or apples to eat. 

**Action: left**  
→ Move to (6,4) to explore and check for dirt or apples.

Reasoning: Without visibility, you can't act productively. Exploration is necessary to find dirt (to clean and enable apple spawning) or apples (to eat). Starting left is a safe, logical first step to investigate the surroundings.
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (7,2), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (8,1), you are not on any dirt, so you cannot clean. There is no apple visible at your position.  

Dirt is at (7,2) and (6,0) — both are not adjacent to you. You can only clean dirt if you are on the same cell.  

Since there are no apples at (8,1), you cannot eat.  

Best action: **move** toward a dirt cell to clean it.  

Best move: **left** to (7,1), then possibly to (7,2) to clean.  

But you can only clean if on the cell. So first, **move left to (7,1)** — not on dirt yet.  

Then from (7,1), you can move to (7,2) to clean.  

So: **left** → then **up** or **right** to reach (7,2).  

But currently, from (8,1), **left** is best first move.  

**Action: left**.  

**Reasoning**: You need to locate dirt to clean and eventually apples to eat. Without movement, you can't progress. Exploration is essential.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Dirt at (6,3).
  Thinking: At (7,2), you are not on dirt, so you cannot clean it directly. Dirt is at (6,3), which is not adjacent to your current position. To clean dirt, you must move to a cell with dirt to clean it. Since you can only clean dirt if you're on the same cell, you need to move to (6,3) first.

Action: **move left** to (6,2), then **move down** to (6,3) to reach the dirt.

After cleaning, the river will be cleaner, enabling more apples to spawn on land — which may allow future apple eating. But currently, no apples are available.

Best next step: **move to (6,3)** and **clean**.

✅ Action: **left** → **down** → **clean**.
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,6). Dirt at (7,7), (6,6).
  Thinking: At (7,6), I see dirt at (7,7) and (6,6). I cannot eat an apple yet because there are no apples visible, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned).  

I can only clean dirt **if I am on the same cell** as the dirt. Since I'm at (7,6), I can clean dirt at (7,7) only if I move there. But I can't clean (6,6) from (7,6) — it's not adjacent.  

So, to clean dirt:  
- Move to (7,7) → clean it.  
- Then, maybe move to (6,6) → clean it.  

After cleaning all dirt, the river will be clean, and apples may spawn. But currently, no apples are present.  

**Best action: move to (7,7) and clean it.**  
→ This reduces dirt, brings the river closer to clean, enabling future apple spawning.  

**Action: right** (to move to (7,7))  
Then: clean  

**Final action: right** → clean

Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apples to spawn, the river must be clean—so dirt must be cleaned. However, cleaning dirt gives no points, only enables apple spawning.

But since you see nothing, it's possible that there's no dirt here, or it's out of view. Without direct visibility, you can't confirm.

**Best action: stay**  
Reason: You cannot safely clean or eat without knowing what's in your current cell. Staying allows you to assess the situation. If you move, you might lose sight of your current position or enter a cell with no resources. If there's dirt, you’ll need to clean it; if there’s an apple, you’ll need to eat it. Since nothing is visible, staying is the safest and most informed choice.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,2). Dirt at (6,3).
  Thinking: At (6,2), there is no apple visible. Dirt is at (6,3), which is directly below you. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), I must clean the dirt at (6,3) to potentially enable apple spawning.

However, I can only clean dirt if I am on the same cell as the dirt. So I need to move to (6,3) first.

**Action: down** to (6,3)  
Then **clean** the dirt.

After cleaning, if the river becomes clean, apples might spawn on land (but not immediately — they spawn based on overall river cleanliness). Since I'm now on (6,3), I can then consider moving to a land cell to eat apples.

But currently, no apple is present, and I have no reason to eat yet.

**Final action: down** (to (6,3)) → **clean**.

Reasoning: Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning. I must move to the dirt cell to clean it. This action advances the state toward enabling apple growth, even though it gives no points directly.
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,6). Dirt at (7,7), (6,6).
  Thinking: At (8,6), I see dirt at (7,7) and (6,6). I am not on any dirt, so I cannot clean it yet. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning I need to clean dirt to enable apple spawning.

Since I can only clean dirt if I'm on the same cell, I must move to a dirt cell to clean it.

Dirt is at (7,7) and (6,6). I can move to (7,7) or (6,6).

Let’s evaluate:

- Moving to (7,7): from (8,6) → (7,7) is up-left (diagonal? but only cardinal moves allowed). Only up, down, left, right.

So valid moves: up (7,6), down (9,6), left (8,5), right (8,7).

None of these are on dirt cells (dirt at (7,7) and (6,6)).

Therefore, I cannot reach dirt with a valid move.

Thus, I **cannot clean any dirt** currently.

Since no dirt is reachable, **no apples can spawn**, and I **cannot eat any apple**.

Best action:
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately.  

**Reasoning:**  
- To eat apples, there must be apples on the grid, which only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned).  
- Since you see nothing, there’s no dirt to clean or apple to eat.  
- Without any visible items, the best action is to **move** to explore and find dirt or apples.  

**Action: left**  
(Exploring to the left might reveal dirt or lead to areas where apples can spawn. Moving is necessary to progress.)

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,1). Agent 3 at (7,0).
  Thinking: At (6,1), I am not on a cell with an apple (no apple indicated), and there's no dirt mentioned to clean. Agent 3 is at (7,0), which is off my current position and not relevant unless there's interaction — but no rules suggest agent interaction.  

Since I can only eat or clean what's on my current cell, and there's no apple at (6,1), I cannot eat. There's no indication of dirt at (6,1), so I can't clean either.  

Best action: **stay** — to monitor the situation, as apples may spawn later when the river is clean (which depends on dirt being cleaned elsewhere).  

**Reasoning:** No apple or dirt available to act on. Staying allows observation for future opportunities.  

✅ Action: **stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,6). Dirt at (7,7), (6,6).
  Thinking: At (8,6), I see dirt at (7,7) and (6,6). I am not on any dirt, so I cannot clean it yet. Apples only spawn when the river is clean — but since I’m not on dirt cells, I can't clean them directly.

To enable apple spawning, I must move to a dirt cell and clean it. However, cleaning dirt gives no points, only enables apple spawning.

Available dirt cells:
- (7,7): adjacent to (8,6) — one step left and up.
- (6,6): two steps left, same row.

Best first step: move to (7,7) to clean it.

Action: **left** → move to (7,7)  
Then: **clean** → removes dirt, contributes to cleaner river.

After cleaning (7,7), I can then assess if apples spawn — but spawning depends on overall river cleanliness, which isn't fully defined. Still, cleaning is necessary.

**Next step**: clean (7,7) → enables potential apple spawning.  
Then, if possible, move to (6,6) to clean it.

But currently, I must act.

**Action: left** (to (7,7
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Agent 1 at (6,1).
  Thinking: At (7,0), I am on land. There's no apple visible, and the river is not clean (no dirt cleaning mentioned). Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and I can only clean dirt at my current position, I need to assess:

- Is there dirt at (7,0)? Not stated.  
- Is there an apple at (7,0)? Not mentioned.  
- Agent 1 is at (6,1), possibly far away and not relevant unless interacting (but no interaction rules given).

**Action:**  
I should **clean** if dirt is present — but since no dirt is mentioned, and apples aren't spawning, it's likely the river is currently dirty. To enable apple spawning, I must clean dirt. However, without knowing if dirt exists at (7,0), I can't confirm.

But: **Only clean if on dirt.** If there's no dirt, cleaning does nothing.

**Best move:**  
→ **Stay** at (7,0) and **check** if dirt is present. If not, no action. If yes, clean.

→ **Action: stay**

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Agent 3 at (7,0).
  Thinking: At (7,1), you are on land. Agent 3 is at (7,0), directly below you.  

To maximize points:  
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned).  
- Cleaning dirt gives no points, but is necessary to enable apple spawning.  
- You can only eat or clean from your current position.  

Currently, there’s no mention of dirt at (7,1), so we assume it’s clean. If there’s no dirt, apples might already be spawning — but we don’t know if there are apples present.  

Since apples require a clean river, and we’re at (7,1), if there's dirt nearby (e.g., at (7,0) or adjacent), we must clean it to allow apple spawning. But we can only clean what's at our current position.  

→ If (7,1) has dirt, clean it.  
→ If (7,1) is clean, check if there's an apple — if so, eat it.  

But no information about dirt or apples at (7,1).  

Best action: **Stay** — observe the situation. If there’s dirt at (7,1), clean
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,3). Dirt at (8,3).
  Thinking: You are at (8,3), and there is dirt at your position.  

Action: **clean**  
Reason: You can only gain apples when there is clean land, and apples only spawn on clean land. Since you're on dirt, you must clean it first to enable apple spawning. Cleaning dirt gives no points directly, but it's necessary to make apples possible later.  

After cleaning, you will be on clean land at (8,3), and apples may spawn. Then you can consider eating if an apple appears.  

→ Action: **clean**
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Agent 1 at (7,1).
  Thinking: At (7,0), I am on land. There's no apple visible, and I see Agent 1 at (7,1), which is directly above me. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when there's no dirt), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I need to assess if there's dirt here or nearby.

Currently, I am at (7,0). If there's dirt on my cell, I can clean it (but it gives no points). If there's an apple, I can eat it (+1.0). However, no apple is mentioned, and I’m not told there’s dirt.

Since I have no apple and no dirt mentioned, and I'm not told to move, I should **stay** to assess further. Moving might be necessary if I suspect dirt or apples in adjacent cells, but with no information, best action is:

**Stay** — to avoid unnecessary movement and wait for more information.  

Final action: **stay**.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Agent 3 at (7,0).
  Thinking: At (7,1), you are on land. Agent 3 is at (7,0), directly below you.  

Check surroundings:  
- There's no mention of dirt or apples at (7,1) currently.  
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is removed).  
- Cleaning dirt gives no points, but is necessary for apples to spawn.  
- You can only clean or eat what is directly at your position.  

Since there's no indication of dirt at (7,1), and no apples are mentioned, **you cannot eat**.  

If dirt is present, you must clean it — but since it's not stated, assume no dirt.  

**Best action: stay** — to monitor the situation. If dirt appears or if you learn the river status, you can act.  

→ **Reasoning**: Without dirt to clean or apples to eat, staying is safest. If apples spawn later (when river is clean), you can act then.  

**Action: stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,3). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,3), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apples to spawn, you must first clean dirt. However, since there's nothing in view, you don't know if there's dirt nearby.

**Action: stay**  
Reasoning: Staying allows you to assess the situation. If dirt is present, you may be able to clean it later. Without any visible items, moving blindly could lead you away from necessary actions. Waiting to observe or explore further is safer.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Agent 1 at (7,1).
  Thinking: At (7,0), you are on land. Agent 1 is at (7,1), directly above you. There's no mention of dirt or apples currently.  

To maximize points:  
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is removed).  
- Cleaning dirt gives 0 points but is necessary for apples to appear.  
- You can only clean or eat what is directly at your position.  

Since there's no info about dirt at (7,0), we assume it might be dirty (as dirt is common in such setups).  

**Action: clean**  
→ Cleaning dirt at (7,0) is necessary to enable apple spawning. After cleaning, if apples appear, you can eat them.  

**Reasoning**: Without cleaning, no apples can spawn. Therefore, cleaning is essential first.  

**Next step**: After cleaning, check if apples spawn (if any), then eat them.  

**Final action: clean** ✅

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Agent 3 at (7,0).
  Thinking: At (7,1), I am on land. Agent 3 is at (7,0), directly below me. There's no mention of dirt or apples currently, so I need to assess:

- If there's dirt at (7,1), I can clean it to enable apple spawning.
- If there's an apple, I can eat it for +1.0 point.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — implying dirt removal is necessary.

Since no specific state (dirt or apple) is given, and I'm at (7,1), the safest first step is to **check the current cell**.

But since I can only act on my current position, and no apple or dirt is mentioned, I must assume the environment is neutral.

**Best action: stay** — to monitor the situation. If dirt is present, I can clean it; if an apple appears, I can eat it. Without more info, acting prematurely (like cleaning or eating) might be inefficient.

👉 **Action: stay**  
Reason: No confirmation of dirt or apple. Staying allows observation and safe preparation for future actions.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,3). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,3), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apples to spawn, you must first clean dirt — but only if dirt is present. Without sight of any terrain, it's impossible to know if dirt exists at your position.

Action: **stay**  
Reason: You cannot clean or eat without knowing if dirt or apples are present. Staying allows you to assess the environment next turn when you may gain visibility or detect terrain.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Agent 1 at (7,1).
  Thinking: At (7,0), you are on land. Agent 1 is at (7,1), directly above you.  

Right now, there's no information about dirt or apples in your current cell. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt), and cleaning dirt gives no points, we must first assess whether there's dirt here or nearby.  

However, you are at (7,0), and there's no indication of dirt or apples in this cell. Since you can only eat or clean what's directly at your position, and no apple is mentioned, you cannot eat.  

**Action: stay**  
Reasoning: Without knowing if there's dirt or an apple at (7,0), and since eating requires an apple (which isn't present), cleaning is only beneficial if dirt is present. But there's no indication of dirt. Staying is safe and allows for assessment.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Dirt at (7,4). Agent 2 at (7,4).
  Thinking: You are at (7,5). There is dirt at (7,4), and Agent 2 is also at (7,4).  

You cannot clean dirt if you're not on the same cell. Since you are at (7,5) and the dirt is at (7,4), you must move to (7,4) to clean it — but Agent 2 is already there.  

Assuming only one agent can occupy a cell at a time, and no information suggests Agent 2 can be displaced or cleaned, **you cannot clean the dirt** without moving into an occupied cell.  

Thus, **you cannot clean dirt** and therefore **cannot enable apple spawning** at (7,4).  

Also, there's no apple mentioned at (7,5) or (7,4), so no apple can be eaten.  

**Best action: Move to (7,4) to clean dirt (if possible).**  
But since Agent 2 is there, you **cannot move there**.  

➡️ **Conclusion: Stay at (7,5)** — no action can be taken that increases points.  

**Points: 0** (no apples eaten, dirt not cleaned).  

**Reasoning:** Cannot clean
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,4). Dirt at (7,4). Agent 1 at (7,5).
  Thinking: At (7,4), there is dirt, and you can clean it. Cleaning dirt does not give points, but it's necessary to enable apples to spawn later. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), cleaning the dirt at (7,4) is essential to potentially gain apples in the future.

Agent 1 is at (7,5), but that doesn’t affect your immediate action.

**Action: clean**  
→ This removes the dirt at (7,4), making the cell usable for apples in the future.  
→ No points now, but necessary step for long-term apple spawning.

**Reasoning:** Cleaning is required to enable apple spawning. Without cleaning, no apples can appear. Staying or moving would not help. Cleaning is the only beneficial action here.
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Dirt at (6,2), (7,2).
  Thinking: At (7,1), you can see dirt at (6,2) and (7,2). You are not on any dirt, so you cannot clean it directly. To spawn apples, the river must be clean — but apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Since you're not on dirt cells, you can't clean them now.

Available actions:
- Move to a position where you can clean dirt (e.g., (7,2) or (6,2)) to make the river clean.
- Eat apples — but no apples are currently spawning because the river is not clean.

Best action: **Move to (7,2)** to clean the dirt there.  
After cleaning (7,2), the river becomes cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn on land. Then you can potentially eat apples.

→ **Action: right** (to move to (7,2))

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Agent 2 at (7,4).
  Thinking: At (7,5), I am not on a dirt cell, and there's no apple visible. Agent 2 is at (7,4), directly above me. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points, I must first assess whether there's dirt to clean nearby.

No indication of dirt at (7,5) — so I cannot clean. If there's no apple here, I cannot eat. Therefore, the best action is to **stay** and observe. If dirt is present elsewhere (e.g., at (7,4)), Agent 2 might be cleaning it. But since I can't act on cells beyond my position, and no apple is visible, I have no immediate gain.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: No apple or dirt to act on; staying allows monitoring of surroundings for changes.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,4). Agent 1 at (7,5).
  Thinking: At (7,4), there's no mention of dirt or an apple in the current state. Agent 1 is at (7,5), which is adjacent but not directly relevant unless there's dirt or apple info.

Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points, we must first assess whether there's dirt at (7,4). There's no indication of dirt here.

Action: **stay**  
Reason: No apple is present, and no dirt is mentioned. Without dirt to clean or apple to eat, moving or cleaning is unnecessary. Staying is safe and optimal until more information is available.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (6,2), (7,2).
  Thinking: At (8,1), you are not on any dirt, so you can't clean it yet. Dirt is at (6,2) and (7,2), which are not adjacent to your current position. To clean dirt, you must move to a cell with dirt and then use "clean".  

Currently, there are no apples visible, and apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. Since you're not on any dirt cells, you can't clean anything yet.  

**Action: Move left to (7,1)** — to get closer to (7,2), which has dirt.  
Then, from (7,1), you can move to (7,2) and clean it.  

After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn. Then, you can move to eat apples.  

**Next step: Move to (7,2) and clean.**  

→ **Action: left** (to (7,1))  
→ Then **down** to (7,2) and **clean**.  

This is the logical path to enable apple spawning.  

**Final reasoning:** You must first clean dirt to enable apple spawning. You are not adjacent to any dirt

--- Step 35 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Agent 2 at (7,4).
  Thinking: At (7,5), I am not on a dirt cell, and there's no visible apple. Agent 2 is at (7,4), directly above me. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first determine if there's dirt to clean nearby.

Currently, I am at (7,5). If this cell is land, and clean, then apples might spawn—but only if the river is clean. Since no dirt is mentioned, and no action is available, I assume the immediate area may not have dirt.

But since I can only clean dirt *on my cell*, and I have no information about dirt at (7,5), I should **stay** to assess.

**Reasoning**: No apple is visible, and I don't know if there's dirt to clean at (7,5). Moving might risk missing a cleanable cell. Best action: **stay** to evaluate the current cell state.  

**Action: stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,4). Agent 1 at (7,5).
  Thinking: At (7,4), I am not on an apple (no apple indicated), and there's no mention of dirt to clean. Agent 1 is at (7,5), which is directly above me.  

Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points, I must first determine if there's dirt at my current position. There's no information about dirt at (7,4), so I cannot assume it exists.

**Action: stay**  
Reasoning: Without knowing if there's dirt or an apple at (7,4), I cannot safely clean or eat. Staying allows me to assess the situation. If dirt is present, I can clean it later. If an apple appears, it will only spawn when the river is clean — so I need to ensure the environment is clean first.  

→ **Stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Dirt at (6,2), (7,2), (8,1).
  Thinking: At (7,1), I see dirt at (6,2), (7,2), and (8,1). I am not on any dirt, so I cannot clean yet. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned to enable apples.  

Currently, I am at (7,1), which is land (no dirt). To clean dirt, I must move to a cell with dirt. The closest dirt cells are:

- (7,2): directly above me → can move up
- (8,1): directly to the right → can move right
- (6,2): diagonally up-left → farther, less efficient

Best first step: **move up to (7,2)** to clean the dirt there.

**Action: up**  
→ Now at (7,2), which has dirt.  
→ I can now **clean** that dirt.

After cleaning (7,2), that cell becomes clean. The river is now slightly cleaner, increasing chances for apples to spawn nearby.  

Reason: Without any visible items or information about the surroundings, I cannot safely perform *clean* or *eat*. Staying allows me to assess the situation further. If I move, I might miss the opportunity to clean dirt or eat an apple. Thus, staying is the safest and most informed choice.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,5). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,5), nothing is visible. Since there are no apples or dirt visible, I cannot eat or clean immediately.  

**Reasoning**: To eat apples, the river must be clean (i.e., dirt must be cleaned), and apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Since I currently see nothing, I must first explore to find dirt to clean or apples to eat.  

**Next step**: Move in a direction to explore the surroundings (e.g., up, down, left, right) to locate dirt or apples.  

Action: **up** (to explore)
  Decision: 'up' -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Dirt at (7,0).
  Thinking: You are at (6,0). Dirt is at (7,0), which is to your right.  

Action: **right**  
Reason: You need to move to (7,0) to clean the dirt. Cleaning dirt doesn't give points, but it's necessary to make the river clean and enable apples to spawn. Once the river is clean, apples may appear, and you can then eat them for points.  

After cleaning, you can assess if apples have spawned and decide whether to eat or move.  

**Next step: right → clean**

  Thinking: At (8,2), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apple spawning, you must first clean dirt — but you need to know if there's dirt to clean.

However, since nothing is visible and you're at (8,2), it's possible you're on clean land or there's no dirt present. Without dirt, apples won't spawn.

**Action: stay**  
Reasoning: You cannot clean or eat without knowing if there's dirt or an apple. Staying allows you to assess the situation further. If you later see dirt or an apple, you can act accordingly. Without any visible items, moving would be unproductive.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,6). Dirt at (6,5).
  Thinking: At (6,6), there is dirt at (6,5), which is directly below you. Since you can only clean dirt when you are on the same cell, you cannot clean the dirt at (6,5) from (6,6).  

There are no apples mentioned, and apples only spawn when the river is clean — which depends on dirt being cleaned. Since we can't clean (6,5) from (6,6), no apples are currently spawning.  

Action: **move down to (6,5)** to clean the dirt.  
After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn later.  

→ **Action: down**
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Dirt at (7,0).
  Thinking: You are at (7,0), and there is dirt at your position.  

Action: **clean**  
Reason: Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apples to spawn. Since apples only appear on land when the river is clean, and you're currently on dirt, you must clean it first. Cleaning gives no points directly, but it's essential for future apple spawning. After cleaning, you can check if apples appear and consider eating them.  

Next step: After cleaning, assess if apples have spawned. If yes, you can eat them (+1.0 each). If not, continue cleaning or exploring.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,2), with nothing in view, I cannot see any apples or dirt. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when there's dirt to clean), and I can only clean or eat what's directly at my position, I must first check if there's dirt to clean.

But since nothing is visible, I assume there's no dirt or apple currently at (8,2). Without any visible item, I cannot eat or clean.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: No visible item to clean or eat. Staying is safe and allows me to reassess if anything appears in my view later.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,5). Dirt at (6,5).
  Thinking: You are at (6,5), and there is dirt at your position.  

Action: **clean**  
Reason: You can only eat apples when the river is clean, which requires removing dirt. Since you're on dirt, you must clean it first to enable apple spawning. Cleaning gives no points directly, but it's necessary to unlock the ability to eat apples later.  

→ Do **clean**.
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first determine if there's dirt to clean.

However, since nothing is visible, it's likely that your current cell is either clean or empty. Without dirt, you cannot clean it, and without dirt being cleaned, apples won't spawn.

**Action: stay**  
Reasoning: You need to assess your surroundings first. Since nothing is visible and no dirt is apparent, moving might not help. Staying allows you to check if dirt appears or if apples spawn later when the environment changes. If you move, you risk missing a cleanable cell or apple. Stay to maintain position and monitor for changes.  

→ **Stay**

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,2), nothing is visible. Since there are no apples or dirt visible, I cannot eat or clean immediately.  

First, I need to explore the area to find dirt (to clean) or apples (to eat).  

Action: **left**  
→ Move to (7,2) to check surroundings.  

Reasoning: Exploration is necessary. Without seeing anything, I can't act. Moving left is a safe, logical first step to gather information.
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,5). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,5), nothing is visible. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first determine if there's dirt to clean. Without any visible items, I cannot confirm if there's dirt at my current position.

Action: **stay**  
Reasoning: I need to assess the environment first. Since I can't see anything and no items are visible, I cannot safely clean or eat. Staying allows me to gather more information—perhaps a future observation will reveal dirt or apples. Moving without knowing the surroundings risks missing an opportunity or wasting action.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first check if there's dirt to clean. Without sight of anything, you cannot confirm if dirt is present.

However, since you're at (7,0) and nothing is visible, it's likely that you're on a land cell with no immediate dirt or apples. To enable apple spawning, you need to clean dirt — but you can only clean dirt if it's on your current cell.

**Action: clean**  
Reason: Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning. Even though cleaning gives no points, it's a prerequisite for apples to appear. Without cleaning, no apples can spawn. Proceeding to clean ensures future apple access.  

→ **Action: clean**

--- Step 29 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,1). Dirt at (8,2). Agent 3 at (7,0).
  Thinking: At (6,1), there is no apple currently. The dirt is at (8,2), which is not adjacent to you. To eat an apple, the river must be clean (i.e., dirt must be cleaned), and apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Since you are not on dirt, you cannot clean it directly.  

You need to move to (8,2) to clean the dirt, but that requires moving right to (7,1), then down to (8,1), then right to (8,2).  

However, cleaning dirt gives no points, but it's necessary to enable apple spawning. Once the dirt is cleaned, apples may spawn on land (which is not explicitly defined, but likely means adjacent land cells).  

But currently, there are no apples visible.  

Best action: **move right to (7,1)** to get closer to the dirt.  

→ **Action: right**  

(Reason: To eventually clean the dirt and enable apple spawning, which would allow eating apples later. Cleaning dirt first is essential, even though it gives no points.)
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,6). Dirt at (7,7), (6,6).
  Thinking: At (7,6), you see dirt at (7,7) and (6,6). You cannot clean dirt or eat apples unless you're on a cell with dirt or an apple.

- You are currently at (7,6), which has no dirt listed — so no cleaning possible.
- Dirt is at (7,7) and (6,6), both of which are not currently occupied.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — but we don't have apple locations. So no apples to eat.

**Action: move to (7,7)**  
→ You can clean dirt at (7,7) from there. Cleaning dirt helps make the river cleaner, which may enable apple spawning later.

**Reasoning:** Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning, even though it gives no points. Since apples are the only way to gain points, cleaning dirt is a prerequisite. Moving to (7,7) allows you to clean it and progress toward enabling apple growth.

✅ Action: **down** → to (8,6)? Wait — (7,7) is right of (7,6). So:

→ **right** to (7,7)

✅ Final action: **right** (to move to (
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Agent 1 at (6,1).
  Thinking: At (7,0), I am on land. There's no dirt visible here, and I don't see an apple. Agent 1 is at (6,1), which is adjacent — but agents don't directly affect my actions.

Since I can only eat apples or clean dirt *at my current position*, and there's no dirt or apple visible at (7,0), I should:

- **Stay** — to assess the surroundings.

Wait: The rule says apples only spawn when the river is clean. But I'm at (7,0), which is land. If there's no dirt here, no need to clean. If there's no apple, I can't eat.

So unless there's an apple (not visible), I cannot eat.

Therefore, best action: **stay** — to monitor for apple spawn (which depends on river cleanliness, not directly visible here).

Final action: **stay**.

--- Step 30 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Dirt at (8,2). Agent 3 at (7,0).
  Thinking: At (7,1), there is no apple currently. The only dirt is at (8,2), which is not adjacent to you. You cannot eat an apple unless one is on your cell, and there's no indication of an apple at (7,1).  

To enable apples to spawn, the river must be clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. Since dirt is at (8,2), you need to move there to clean it.  

Best action: **move right to (8,1)**, then **move down to (8,2)** to clean the dirt.  

After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner, which increases the chance of apples spawning (though not guaranteed). Once clean, if apples appear, you can eat them.  

Current best step: **right** → **down** → clean.  

**Action: right**.
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,6). Dirt at (7,7), (6,6).
  Thinking: At (8,6), you are not on any dirt, so you can't clean. There's dirt at (7,7) and (6,6), but you can only clean if you're on a cell with dirt.  

Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. Since you're not on any dirt cells, you can't clean them directly.  

Thus, your best action is to **move** to a dirt cell to clean it.  

Best move: **left** to (7,6) — not a dirt cell.  
Better: **up** to (8,7) — not dirt.  
Better: **down** to (9,6) — unknown.  

Wait — dirt is at (7,7) and (6,6).  

To reach (7,7): move **up** to (7,7) → then clean.  
To reach (6,6): move **left** to (7,6), then **up** to (6,6).  

Shortest path to (7,7): (8,6) → (7,6) → (7,7) → clean.  
Or directly: (8,
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Agent 1 at (7,1).
  Thinking: At (7,0), I am on land. There's no dirt visible, and Agent 1 is at (7,1), directly above me. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and I currently have no dirt to clean, I cannot spawn apples yet.

Action: **stay**  
Reasoning: I need to assess whether there's dirt nearby to clean. Since I'm at (7,0) and Agent 1 is at (7,1), I don't currently have dirt to clean. Without dirt, no apples can spawn. I should stay to monitor the situation or move if dirt is detected. But as no dirt is mentioned, and I can't eat an apple without one, I remain at (7,0) to wait or plan next steps.  

Best action: **stay**.

--- Step 31 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (6,2), (8,2). Agent 3 at (7,0).
  Thinking: At (8,1), I see dirt at (6,2) and (8,2). I am not on any dirt, so I cannot clean yet. Apples only spawn when the river is clean — but since I'm not on dirt cells, I can't clean them directly.  

Agent 3 is at (7,0), far away, and doesn’t affect me.  

I need to move to a dirt cell to clean it. The closest dirt is at (8,2) — directly above me.  

**Action: move right → (8,2)**  
Now I’m on dirt at (8,2).  

**Action: clean**  
Cleaning this dirt helps make the river cleaner, which may enable apples to spawn.  

After cleaning, I can stay or move to check for apples. But since apples only spawn when the river is clean (and dirt is reduced), and I just cleaned one cell, the next step is to see if apples appear.  

But I don’t have a way to detect apple spawn directly — only if I’m on a land cell with apples.  

Currently, I'm on (8,2), which was dirt. After cleaning, it may become land. If apples spawn, they’d
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,6). Dirt at (7,7), (6,6).
  Thinking: At (7,6), you can see dirt at (7,7) and (6,6).  

- You cannot eat an apple yet because there are no apples mentioned — apples only spawn when the river is clean, which depends on dirt being cleaned.  
- You can **clean** dirt only if you are on the same cell as the dirt.  
  - You are at (7,6), so you can **clean (7,7)** if you move there, but not directly from (7,6) to (7,7) via clean unless you move first.  
  - You are *not* on (6,6), so you can't clean that dirt directly.  

**Action plan:**  
1. Move to (7,7) to clean the dirt there.  
2. After cleaning (7,7), the river becomes cleaner, possibly enabling apple spawning.  
3. Then, if apples appear, you can eat them.  

**Best immediate action:** `right` to move to (7,7), then `clean`.  

→ **Action: right**
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Agent 1 at (8,1).
  Thinking: At (7,0), I am not on land with an apple (no apple visible), and there's no indication of dirt to clean. Agent 1 is at (8,1), which is off my position.  

Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and I can only clean or eat what's directly at my position, I must first check if there's dirt at (7,0). There's no mention of dirt here, so likely no dirt to clean.  

No apple is present at (7,0), so I cannot eat.  

**Action: stay**  
Reason: No dirt to clean, no apple to eat. Staying is safe and avoids unnecessary movement. I need to assess the environment further before acting.

--- Step 16 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (10,6). Dirt at (8,7). Apple at (10,7).
  Thinking: You are at (10,6).  
There is dirt at (8,7) and an apple at (10,7).

- You cannot eat the apple at (10,7) directly because you're at (10,6) and not on that cell.  
- You cannot clean the dirt at (8,7) because you're not on that cell.  
- To eat the apple at (10,7), you first need to move there.  
- To clean dirt, you must be on the cell with dirt.  

**Best action:** Move right to (10,7) to eat the apple.  

**Reasoning:**  
The apple is adjacent and reachable. Since eating apples gives +1.0 points and cleaning dirt gives no points, it's better to eat the apple than clean dirt (which doesn't yield points). You can only eat apples when you're on their cell.  

✅ Action: **right** (to move to (10,7))  
Then: **eat** (to gain +1.0 point)  

Final action: **right**
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,4). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,4), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately.  

**Reasoning**: To eat apples, the river must be clean (i.e., dirt must be cleaned), and apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Since you currently see nothing, you must first explore to find dirt to clean or apples to eat.  

**Action**: Move in a direction to explore (e.g., up, down, left, right) to locate dirt or apples.  

→ **Action: up** (to explore the area above)
  Decision: 'up' -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Dirt at (7,2), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (7,1), you can see dirt at (7,2) and (6,0). You cannot eat an apple yet because there are no apples visible, and apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned.

**Action: clean (7,2)**  
- You are at (7,1), so (7,2) is directly to the right.  
- You can move to (7,2) to clean it, but only if you move first.  

But: **You can only clean dirt if you are on the same cell as the dirt.**  
So, to clean (7,2), you must move to (7,2).  

**Step-by-step reasoning:**  
1. You are at (7,1).  
2. Dirt is at (7,2) — you can move to (7,2) to clean it.  
3. Dirt at (6,0) is farther away — you’d need to go to (6,0) to clean it, but it's not adjacent.  
4. Cleaning dirt enables apple spawning on land — so cleaning (7,2) is the immediate action.  
5. After cleaning (7,2), if

--- Step 17 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (11,6). Apple at (10,7).
  Thinking: At (11,6), there's an apple at (10,7). To eat it, I need to move to that position.

Step-by-step:
- Current position: (11,6)
- Apple is at (10,7) → one step left and one step up from current position.

So, I should:
1. Move left to (11,7)
2. Move up to (10,7)

Once at (10,7), I can eat the apple (+1.0 point).

No dirt to clean here, and no need to clean first — apple is already present.

✅ Action: left → up → eat

**Final action: up** (after moving left first — but since we must act one step at a time, next move is up)

But the user only asked for reasoning, not full sequence.

**Short reasoning:**  
The apple is at (10,7), one step up and left from current position. I must move there first to eat it. Eating gives +1.0 point. No dirt to clean. So, move left then up, then eat.
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,5). Dirt at (8,6).
  Thinking: At (6,5), you are not on dirt, so you cannot clean it directly. Dirt is at (8,6), which is not adjacent to your current position. To clean dirt, you must move to that cell first.

**Action: right → (7,5)**  
Then: **right → (8,5)**  
Then: **up → (8,6)**  

Now you are on the dirt at (8,6) and can **clean** it.

Cleaning dirt gives no points, but it improves the river's cleanliness, which increases apple spawning on land. Once clean, apples may spawn on land cells (if any), and you can then eat them for +1.0 each.

**Next step:** After cleaning, check if any apples have spawned on adjacent land cells. If yes, move to eat them.

But currently, no apples are visible.

**Final reasoning:** Move to (8,6) to clean the dirt. This is necessary to enable apple spawning. Then monitor for apples.  

**Immediate action: right → (7,5)** (to get closer to (8,6))
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (7,2), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (8,1), you are not on any dirt, so you cannot clean. There's no apple visible at your position.  

Dirt is at (7,2) and (6,0) — both are not adjacent to you. You can only clean dirt if you're on the same cell. Since you're at (8,1), you can't reach those dirt cells directly without moving.  

**Action:** Move to a position adjacent to dirt to clean it.  

Best move: **left** to (7,1) — now adjacent to (7,2), which has dirt. From there, you can clean (7,2).  

After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner → more apples may spawn on land. Then you can move to eat apples.  

**Next step:** Move left to (7,1), then clean (7,2).  

**Reasoning:** Cleaning dirt enables apple spawning. Without cleaning, no apples can appear. So prioritize cleaning dirt, even though it gives no points.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (10,6). Dirt at (8,7), (8,6). Apple at (10,7).
  Thinking: At (10,6):  
- There's an apple at (10,7) — directly to the right.  
- Dirt is at (8,7) and (8,6) — not adjacent to you.  
- You can only eat apples or clean dirt if you're on the same cell.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**  
- You are at (10,6). The apple is at (10,7), which is one cell away. You can't eat it unless you move there.  
- The dirt at (8,7) and (8,6) is not adjacent to you — so you cannot clean it from here.  
- Cleaning dirt gives no points, but is necessary for apples to spawn. However, apples are already present at (10,7), so the river is clean enough for apples to exist.  

**Conclusion:**  
You can move to (10,7) to eat the apple (+1.0 point).  
You cannot clean dirt from here, and it's not needed since apples are already present.

**Action: right** → move to (10,7), then **eat**.  

**Final action: right, then eat.** ✅
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Dirt at (8,6).
  Thinking: You are at (7,5). Dirt is at (8,6).  

To clean the dirt, you must move to (8,6) first.  
- Moving right to (8,5), then up to (8,6) will get you there.  

But you can only clean dirt if you are on the same cell. So:  
→ Move right to (8,5)  
→ Move up to (8,6) and clean the dirt.  

Cleaning dirt gives no points, but it enables apples to spawn on land (which is necessary to eat apples).  

After cleaning, if apples spawn (which depends on overall river cleanliness), you may be able to eat them.  

Currently, there's no apple mentioned, so no eating possible yet.  

**Action: right → up → clean**  

(Reasoning: Clean the dirt to enable apple spawning, as apples only appear when the river is clean.)
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Dirt at (7,2), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (7,1), you are not on any dirt, so you cannot clean. There's no apple visible at your position.  

Dirt is at (7,2) and (6,0) — both are not adjacent to you. To clean dirt, you must move to a cell with dirt.  

**Action: move down to (8,1)** — not helpful.  
**Action: move up to (6,1)** — still not adjacent to (7,2) or (6,0).  
**Action: move right to (7,2)** — now you're on dirt at (7,2).  

✅ **Best move: right to (7,2)**  
Now you can **clean** the dirt at (7,2). Cleaning dirt doesn't give points, but it helps the river become cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn later.  

After cleaning (7,2), the river is slightly cleaner. Apples may spawn on land when the river is clean.  

**Next step**: After cleaning, check if apples appear — but currently, no apple is mentioned. So, stay or move to check (6,0) or nearby.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Agent 3 at (7,0).
  Thinking: At (7,1), I am not on a dirt cell, and there's no visible apple. Agent 3 is at (7,0), which might be a dirt cell, but I can't interact with their position.  

Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points, I must first determine if there's dirt at my current position.  

No information suggests dirt is present at (7,1). If there's no dirt, no apples can spawn.  

Therefore, **I should stay** at (7,1) to assess the situation. If I later see dirt or apples, I can act accordingly.  

**Action: stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,3). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,3), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apples to spawn, you must first clean dirt. However, since nothing is visible, there's no dirt to clean, and no apples to eat.

**Reasoning:** Without any visible dirt or apples, you cannot gain points. To progress, you must explore and move to a location where dirt exists (to clean it) so that apples can spawn later. 

**Action: stay**  
(No immediate benefit to move; staying allows you to assess the environment if new info appears. If visibility improves or other actions become available, you can adjust.)
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Agent 1 at (7,1).
  Thinking: At (7,0), you are on land. Agent 1 is at (7,1), directly above you. There's no mention of dirt or apples currently.  

Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, we must first assess whether dirt is present.  

Currently, no dirt is mentioned, and no action has been taken. Since you're at (7,0), if there's dirt here, you can clean it. But without explicit dirt information, assume the state is neutral.  

If there's no dirt, no apples are present. If there is dirt, cleaning it would enable apple spawning — but cleaning gives no points.  

**Best action:**  
→ **clean** (if dirt is present), to enable apple spawning.  
→ If no dirt, then **stay** or **move** to check adjacent cells.  

But since we don’t have dirt info, and apples require clean river (dirt cleaned), and we can only act at our position, the safest move is to **clean** — to set the stage for future apple spawning.  

**Action: clean**.  

(Reasoning: Cleaning dirt enables apple spawning. Without cleaning

--- Step 46 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Agent 3 at (7,0).
  Thinking: At (7,1), I am not on a dirt cell, and there's no visible apple. Agent 3 is at (7,0), which might be on dirt. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I should first check if I can clean dirt to enable apple spawning.

However, I am currently at (7,1). If (7,0) is dirt (and Agent 3 is there), I can't clean it directly unless I move to it. So, I should first **move down** to (7,0) to clean the dirt if it exists.

But — I don’t know if (7,0) is dirt. Since Agent 3 is there, and agents can be on cells, it might be a dirt cell. If it is, cleaning it will help the river become cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn later.

**Best action: move down to (7,0)** to potentially clean dirt and enable apple spawning.

→ **Action: down**
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,3). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,3), with nothing in view, I cannot see any apples or dirt. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and I can only clean dirt or eat apples at my current position, I must first determine whether there's dirt to clean.

But since nothing is visible and no items are reported, it's likely that (8,3) is either clean or empty. Without confirmation of dirt, I cannot clean. Also, without an apple, I cannot eat.

**Best action: stay**  
Reasoning: I have no information about dirt or apples at (8,3). Moving would risk missing a potential resource. Staying allows me to assess the situation—perhaps dirt or an apple will appear when I can detect it. Cleaning or eating is only possible if there's a visible item, which there isn't.  

**Action: stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Agent 1 at (7,1).
  Thinking: At (7,0), you are on land. Agent 1 is at (7,1), directly above you. There's no mention of dirt or apples currently, so we must assess:

- If there's dirt at (7,0), you can clean it (clean action), but cleaning gives no points.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be removed from river areas. Since we don’t know the river's location or current dirt status, we can't assume apples are available.
- You can only eat apples if they are present on your cell.

Currently, no apples are mentioned, so **you cannot eat**.

**Best action: stay**  
Reason: You're at (7,0). Without knowing if there's dirt or apples, moving might lead you away from potential opportunities. Staying allows you to monitor the situation — if dirt is present, you can clean it (to enable apples later). If apples appear, you can eat them.  

→ **Stay**

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Agent 3 at (7,0).
  Thinking: At (7,1), I am on land. Agent 3 is at (7,0), directly below me.  

To maximize points:  
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when there's less dirt).  
- Cleaning dirt gives no points, but is necessary to enable apple spawning.  
- I can only clean or eat what is directly at my position.  

Right now, I don’t know if there’s dirt at (7,1), or if apples are present. Since there's no mention of dirt or apples, I assume the current state is neutral.  

**Action:**  
→ **Stay** at (7,1) to assess the situation.  

If there’s dirt here, I can clean it (no points, but enables future apple spawning). If there’s an apple, I can eat it (+1 point).  

Since I don’t have information about the current cell content, **staying** is the safest and most strategic first step.  

**Final action: stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,3). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,3), nothing is visible, so I don't know if there's dirt or an apple. Since I can only clean dirt or eat apples when I'm on a cell, and there's no indication of either, I should **stay** to avoid moving into an unknown area.  

**Action: stay**  
Reason: No information about surroundings — moving could lead to wasted actions or missing opportunities. Staying safe is optimal until more info is available.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Agent 1 at (7,1).
  Thinking: At (7,0), you are on land. Agent 1 is at (7,1), directly above you.  

Currently, there's no mention of dirt or apples. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when there's less dirt), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, we must first assess whether dirt exists at (7,0).  

If there's dirt at (7,0), you can **clean** it (but gain 0 points). If there's no dirt, you can **eat** an apple only if one is present — but apples only spawn when the river is clean.  

Since no dirt or apples are mentioned, and the river's cleanliness is not known, we **cannot assume apples are present**.  

Best action: **stay** — to monitor the situation. If dirt is present, we can clean it. If apples appear later (after cleaning), we can eat them.  

Next, I should check if any apples are now available — but apples only spawn *after* dirt is cleaned, and only on land. Since (7,2) is now clean,

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Agent 2 at (7,4).
  Thinking: At (7,5), I am not on a dirt cell, and there's no visible apple. Agent 2 is at (7,4), which is directly above me. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points, I must first determine if there's dirt to clean nearby.

Currently, I am at (7,5). If there's dirt at (7,5), I can clean it to enable apple spawning. However, I don’t have information about the terrain or dirt status at my current position. 

Since I can only eat or clean what I’m on, and there’s no apple visible, I should first check if I can clean dirt to enable apples. Without knowing if (7,5) has dirt, I can't proceed.

But given the lack of dirt info and no apple, the safest and most strategic move is to **stay** — to assess the situation further. 

**Action: stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,4). Agent 1 at (7,5).
  Thinking: At (7,4), I am not on an apple. Agent 1 is at (7,5), which is directly above me. There's no indication of dirt or apples at my current position.  

To maximize points:  
- I need to clean dirt to enable apple spawning, but cleaning gives no points.  
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — so cleaning is necessary but not directly rewarding.  
- I can only eat apples if I'm on a cell with one.  

Currently, I have no apple and no dirt to clean. I should investigate whether there's dirt nearby to clean. Since I'm at (7,4), I can check adjacent cells.  

Best action: **up** to (7,5) to see if Agent 1 is there for a reason — maybe they’re cleaning or there’s dirt. Alternatively, if (7,5) has dirt, I can clean it.  

But since I don’t know the state of the environment, safest and most strategic move: **up** to (7,5) to check.  

**Action: up**.
  Decision: 'up' -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Dirt at (6,2), (7,2), (8,1).
  Thinking: At (7,1), I see dirt at (6,2), (7,2), and (8,1). I am not on any of the dirt cells, so I cannot clean them directly.  

To eat apples, the river must be clean — meaning dirt must be removed. But I can only clean dirt **if I am on the same cell** as the dirt.  

Currently, I am at (7,1), which has no dirt. The dirt is at (6,2), (7,2), and (8,1). I need to move to one of those cells to clean them.  

Let’s evaluate:  
- To clean (7,2): move right to (7,2) → possible.  
- To clean (8,1): move down to (8,1) → possible.  
- To clean (6,2): move up-left to (6,2) → possible but farther.  

Best immediate move: **move right to (7,2)** — this is adjacent and allows me to clean dirt.  

After cleaning (7,2), dirt is gone, and the river becomes slightly cleaner. Then, if apples spawn, I can eat them.  

But I currently don

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Agent 2 at (7,4).
  Thinking: At (7,5), I am on land. Agent 2 is at (7,4), directly above me.  

There’s no mention of dirt or apples currently. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when there's less dirt), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first assess whether there's dirt here or nearby.  

I am at (7,5) — if there’s dirt on this cell, I can clean it. But without explicit info on dirt status, I can’t assume.  

However, since apples spawn only when the river is clean, and I can't eat apples unless they’re present, I should first check if I can clean dirt to enable apple spawning.  

But: I have no info about dirt at (7,5).  

Best action: **clean** — if dirt is present, cleaning it helps enable apple spawning. Even though cleaning gives no points, it's necessary to allow apples to spawn later.  

**Action: clean**.
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,4). Agent 1 at (7,5).
  Thinking: At (7,4), I am not on an apple (no apple mentioned), and there's no indication of dirt to clean. Agent 1 is at (7,5), which is directly above me. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points, I must first assess whether there's dirt to clean at my current position.

There is no information about dirt at (7,4), so I cannot clean anything. I cannot eat an apple either, as none is present.

**Best action: stay**  
Reason: No dirt to clean, no apple to eat. Moving would not help. Staying is safe and avoids wasted action.  

→ **Action: stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (6,2), (7,2), (7,1), (8,1).
  Thinking: At (8,1), you are on a cell with dirt.  
Dirt is also at (6,2), (7,2), (7,1).  

You can only **clean dirt** if you are on the same cell as the dirt.  
You can only **eat apples** if there is an apple on your cell — but apples only spawn when the river is clean, which depends on overall dirt levels.  

Currently, there's dirt at (7,1) and (8,1) — you are on (8,1), so you can clean that dirt.  

**Action: clean**  
→ Cleaning (8,1) removes dirt from that cell.  

Now, dirt is only at (6,2) and (7,2).  

But note: **cleaning dirt gives no points**, only enables apple spawning.  
Apples spawn on land when the river is clean — likely meaning when dirt is reduced.  

Since you are at (8,1), and there's still dirt at (6,2) and (7,2), the river isn’t fully clean.  

But you cannot reach (6,2) or (7,2) directly without moving.  

So:

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Dirt at (6,6). Agent 2 at (7,4).
  Thinking: At (7,5), there is dirt at (6,6), which is not adjacent to you. You cannot clean dirt at (6,6) unless you move there. Agent 2 is at (7,4), directly below you — but there's no indication they are blocking or affecting your actions.

Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning, cleaning dirt is necessary, but it doesn’t give points. Since you are not on dirt, you cannot clean it now. There's no apple visible at your position.

**Action: Move to (6,6) to clean the dirt.**  
Why? Because only by cleaning dirt can the river become clean, enabling apple spawning. Without cleaning, no apples appear.

→ **Action: right** (to go to (7,6))? No — (6,6) is not adjacent.  
Adjacent cells from (7,5): (6,5), (8,5), (7,4), (7,6)

(6,6) is diagonal — not reachable directly.

So from (7,5), you can go:
- Up to (6,5)
- Down to (8,5)
- Left to (7,4) —
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,4). Agent 1 at (7,5).
  Thinking: At (7,4), there's no mention of dirt or an apple in the current state. Agent 1 is at (7,5), which is directly above you. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, we must first assess whether we can clean dirt to enable apple spawning.

However, we don’t have information about dirt at (7,4) or nearby. Since we’re at (7,4), if there's dirt here, we can clean it — but we don’t know that yet.

**Best action: clean**  
→ If dirt is present, cleaning it will make the land clean, allowing apples to spawn (potentially later).  
→ If no dirt, cleaning does nothing, but staying is not beneficial without knowing future apple spawns.

We cannot eat an apple yet without knowing if one is present. Since apples spawn only when the river is clean, and we don’t know the current state of dirt, we must first clean to enable apple spawning.


--- Step 30 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,2), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and you can only eat apples or clean dirt when on a cell, you must first determine whether there's dirt to clean or an apple to eat.

However, since nothing is visible, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), it's likely that there's no dirt or apple currently at (7,2). Without any visible item, you cannot eat or clean.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: No visible items to act on. Staying allows you to monitor the environment or wait for new information (e.g., dirt or apples appearing) that might spawn when the river is cleaned. Cleaning or eating requires being on a cell with the respective item. Without evidence of dirt or apples, acting is not beneficial.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,5). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,5), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first check if there's dirt to clean. Without visibility, you cannot confirm whether dirt exists at your current position.

**Action: stay**  
Reasoning: Staying allows you to assess your surroundings. If dirt is present, you can clean it to enable apple spawning. Without knowing what’s around you, moving blindly risks missing opportunities or wasting actions. Staying is safe and enables you to evaluate the situation before acting.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first determine if there's dirt to clean.

However, with no visible items, it's likely that either:
- There's no dirt at (7,0), or
- The surrounding area is empty and you need to explore to find dirt or apples.

Since you can only clean dirt or eat apples **on your current cell**, and there's nothing visible, the safest action is to **stay** and assess the situation. Without knowing if dirt exists or if apples are nearby, moving blindly risks missing opportunities.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: No visible items, so no immediate action (clean or eat) is possible. Staying allows you to remain in a position where you can detect or react to changes.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Dirt at (6,1).
  Thinking: At (7,2), you are not on any dirt. The dirt is at (6,1), which is not adjacent to your current position. To clean dirt, you must move to the cell with dirt and then use the "clean" action.

Currently, you cannot eat an apple because there's no apple spawn (apples only spawn when the river is clean, which requires cleaning dirt). Since dirt is at (6,1), you need to:

- Move to (6,1) (e.g., left and down from (7,2)).
- Clean the dirt there.

Cleaning dirt gives no points, but it enables future apple spawning.

**Best action: left, then down to (6,1), then clean.**

After cleaning, if the river becomes clean, apples may spawn — and you can eat them for +1.0 each.

👉 **Action: left** (to move toward (6,1))
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,5). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,5), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apples to spawn, you must first clean dirt. However, since nothing is visible, there's no dirt to clean here.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: Without visible dirt or apples, you cannot perform a useful action. Staying allows you to monitor your position and potentially detect changes (e.g., dirt or apples appearing later). Moving without information could lead to wasted steps.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Dirt at (6,1).
  Thinking: At (7,0), you are not on any dirt. The dirt is at (6,1), which is adjacent but not currently accessible.  

To clean dirt, you must be on the same cell as the dirt. Since you are at (7,0), you cannot clean (6,1) directly.  

Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. Since there's dirt at (6,1), and you're not on it, you can't clean it yet.  

Thus, your best action is to **move** to (6,1) to clean the dirt.  

**Action: left** (to move from (7,0) to (6,0)), then possibly continue to (6,1) — but currently, from (7,0), left takes you to (6,0), not (6,1).  

Wait: (6,0) is adjacent to (6,1). So to reach (6,1), you need to go:  
(7,0) → (6,0) → (6,1)  

But you can only act one step at a time.  

So best next move: **left** to (6

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,2). Dirt at (6,1).
  Thinking: At (6,2), there is no apple visible, but there is dirt at (6,1), directly above you.  

Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when there is no dirt), and dirt at (6,1) is not cleaned yet, the land above you is still dirty.  

**Action:** clean (to remove dirt at (6,1))  
→ This will make the area clean, potentially enabling apple spawning in the future.  

**Reasoning:** Cleaning dirt is necessary to allow apples to spawn, even though cleaning gives no points. Since we are at (6,2) and the dirt is directly above, we must clean it first to progress.  

**Next step:** After cleaning, check if apples appear (though they may not spawn immediately). Then consider moving or eating if apples are present.  

→ **Action: clean** ✅
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,5). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,5), nothing is visible. Since there are no apples or dirt visible, I cannot eat or clean immediately.  

First, I need to explore the area to find dirt (to clean) or apples (to eat).  

Action: **right**  
Reason: Moving right may reveal dirt or apples. Without any information, exploration is necessary to find actionable items.  

(Next step: After moving, check surroundings for dirt or apples.)
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Dirt at (6,1).
  Thinking: At (6,0), there is no apple currently. Dirt is at (6,1), which is directly above you. Since you can only clean dirt if you are on the same cell, you cannot clean the dirt at (6,1) from (6,0).  

To clean dirt, you must move to the cell with dirt. So, you should **move up** to (6,1), then clean it.  

After cleaning, the river will become cleaner, which may enable apples to spawn (though spawning isn't directly visible here). However, since apples only spawn *on land* when the river is clean, and you're not currently on a cell with an apple, eating is not possible yet.  

**Action: up** (to reach (6,1) and clean dirt)  
→ Then, after cleaning, you can evaluate if apples appear or if further movement is needed.  

**Reasoning:** Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning. You must first be on the dirt cell to clean it. Moving up is the only viable action.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,2). Dirt at (7,2), (6,1). Agent 3 at (6,1).
  Thinking: At (6,2), I see dirt at (7,2) and (6,1). Agent 3 is at (6,1), which has dirt. Since I can only clean dirt if I'm on the same cell, I must move to a cell with dirt to clean it.

Option:  
- Move to (7,2): I can clean dirt there.  
- Move to (6,1): But Agent 3 is there — can I move there? The problem doesn’t say agents block movement, but typically in such games, agents occupy cells and prevent entry unless stated otherwise. Since Agent 3 is at (6,1), I likely cannot move there.

Thus, only viable action is **move to (7,2)** and **clean** the dirt there.

After cleaning (7,2), the river becomes cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn — but apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. However, I don't currently see any apple at (6,2) or nearby.

Currently, I am at (7,2) after cleaning. No apple is visible. So I cannot eat.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (11,6). Apple at (10,7).
  Thinking: At (11,6), there's an apple at (10,7). To eat it, I need to move to (10,7).  

Step-by-step:  
- Move left from (11,6) to (10,6).  
- Then move up to (10,7) to eat the apple.  

Action sequence: **left, up**  
→ Then **eat**.  

No dirt to clean here. Apple is accessible.  

✅ Reasoning: I can reach the apple directly by moving left then up. Eating it gives +1.0 point.  

**Action: left, up, eat** ✅
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,5). Dirt at (8,6).
  Thinking: You are at (8,5). There is dirt at (8,6), which is directly above you.  

Action: **clean**  
Reasoning: You can only clean dirt if you are on the same cell as it. Since the dirt is at (8,6), and you are at (8,5), you cannot clean it directly. To clean it, you must move to (8,6) first.  

So, first move: **up** to (8,6).  
Then: **clean** the dirt.  

After cleaning, the river will be cleaner, potentially allowing apples to spawn (though apples only spawn on land when the river is clean). However, cleaning itself gives no points.  

Next, you can then move around to find apples (if they spawn) or continue cleaning.  

But currently, the only actionable step is to move to (8,6) to clean.  

✅ Action: **up** (to reach (8,6))  
Then: **clean** (to make the river cleaner, enabling future apple spawning).  

(Note: No apples are currently visible, and eating requires being on a cell with an apple — which depends on cleaning and spawn conditions.)  

**Next step: up**
  Decision: 'up' -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (7,2), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (8,1), you are not on any dirt, so you cannot clean. There's no apple visible at your position. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — currently, dirt is at (7,2) and (6,0), so the river is not clean yet.

To enable apple spawning, you must clean dirt. However, you can only clean dirt if you are on the same cell as the dirt. You are at (8,1), and dirt is at (7,2) and (6,0). You need to move to one of those cells to clean.

Best next step: **Move to (7,2)** to clean dirt.  
After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn on land. Then, if apples appear, you can eat them for points.

Action: **left** (to move from (8,1) to (7,1)), then **down** to (7,2) — but wait: from (7,1) to (7,2) is down.  
So: **left → down** to reach (7,2).

But let's verify:  
- (8,1) → left → (7,1

--- Step 20 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (10,6). Dirt at (8,7), (8,6). Apple at (10,7). Agent 2 at (8,6).
  Thinking: At (10,6):  
- There's an apple at (10,7) — I can eat it if I move there.  
- Dirt is at (8,7) and (8,6). Agent 2 is at (8,6), which has dirt.  
- I can only clean dirt or eat apples **on my current cell**.  

Right now, I am at (10,6).  
- I cannot eat the apple at (10,7) because I’m not on that cell.  
- I cannot clean dirt at (8,7) or (8,6) because I’m not on those cells.  

So, to act:  
→ I must **move to (10,7)** to eat the apple.  

**Action: right** (to move to (10,7))  
→ Then **eat** (to gain +1.0 point).  

This is optimal: eating an apple gives +1.0 point, and no cleaning is needed since the apple is already spawnable (river is clean — implied by apple presence).  

✅ Final action: **right, then eat**.
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,6). Dirt at (8,7), (8,6). Apple at (10,7). Agent 1 at (10,6).
  Thinking: At (8,6), you see dirt at (8,6) and (8,7), and an apple at (10,7). Agent 1 is at (10,6), which is near the apple but not directly on it.

- You **cannot eat the apple at (10,7)** because you're at (8,6) — you must move there first.
- You **can clean dirt** only at your current position. So you can clean (8,6) — which will help make the land cleaner and potentially allow apples to spawn.
- Cleaning dirt does **not give points**, but it's necessary to enable apple spawning.

**Action plan:**
1. Move right to (8,7) — there's dirt there too. Clean it if possible.
2. Then move right to (8,8) or down/up to reach (9,6), etc., to get closer to (10,7).

But currently, only (8,6) and (8,7) have dirt — both are adjacent. You can clean both only if you move to them.

**Immediate best action:**
→ **Clean (8,6)** (you're already on it).  
→ Then move
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Dirt at (7,2), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (7,1), you can see dirt at (7,2) and (6,0).  

- You cannot eat an apple right now because there's no apple on your cell.  
- You can **clean** dirt only if you are on the same cell as the dirt.  
- Dirt at (7,2) is directly above you — you can move up to (7,2) to clean it.  
- Dirt at (6,0) is far away (left and down), so you'd need to move there, but that doesn’t help directly.  

**Best action: move up to (7,2) to clean the dirt.**  
Cleaning dirt helps make the river cleaner, which increases the chance of apples spawning on land — eventually allowing you to eat apples and gain points.  

→ **Action: up**

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (11,6). Apple at (10,7).
  Thinking: At (11,6), there's an apple at (10,7). To eat it, I need to move to (10,7).  

Steps:  
- Move left to (10,6) — now adjacent to the apple.  
- Then move up to (10,7) to eat the apple.  

But wait: I can only eat apples if the river is clean (i.e., there's no dirt blocking apple spawning). The current state doesn't specify dirt or river conditions. However, since an apple is already present at (10,7), it implies the river is clean enough for apples to spawn.  

Therefore, I can proceed.  

Action: **left** → (10,6)  
Then: **up** → (10,7) → **eat**  

Final action sequence:  
**left, up, eat**  

→ Gain +1.0 point.  

✅ Reasoning: Apple exists at (10,7), so river is clean. I move to that cell and eat. No dirt cleaning needed.
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,6). Dirt at (6,7), (8,7). Apple at (10,7).
  Thinking: At (8,6):  
- Dirt is at (6,7) and (8,7).  
- Apple is at (10,7).  

You can only clean dirt or eat apples **if you are on the same cell** as them.  

Currently:  
- You are at (8,6).  
- (8,7) has dirt — you can clean it if you move there.  
- (10,7) has an apple — you are not on it, so you can't eat it yet.  
- (6,7) is far away — not reachable directly.  

**Action plan:**  
1. Move to (8,7) to clean the dirt there.  
   - After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner (dirt reduced), which increases chances for apples to spawn.  
   - Cleaning gives no points, but enables future apple spawning.  
2. After cleaning (8,7), you can move toward (10,7) to eat the apple.  

**Best action now: right → (8,7)** to clean dirt.  

**Reasoning:** Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and we are currently far

Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Dirt at (7,2).
  Thinking: You are at (7,2), and there is dirt at your position.  

Action: **clean**  
Reasoning: You can only eat apples when there is clean land, and apples only spawn on clean land. Since you're currently on dirt, you must clean it first to enable apple spawning. Cleaning dirt gives no points directly, but it's necessary to unlock the ability to eat apples later.  

→ **Final action: stay**

--- Step 32 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (6,2), (8,2). Agent 3 at (7,0).
  Thinking: At (8,1), I see dirt at (6,2) and (8,2). I am not on any dirt, so I cannot clean yet. Apples only spawn when the river is clean — but since I'm not on dirt cells, I can't clean them directly. 

Agent 3 is at (7,0), which is off-grid in terms of relevance to current dirt. I must first move to a dirt cell to clean it. 

Best move: **move left to (7,1)** — not on dirt, but closer to (8,2). Then eventually move to (8,2) to clean it. 

But currently, I'm at (8,1). The only dirt nearby is (8,2) — directly to the right. 

So:  
→ **right to (8,2)** → now on dirt → **clean** → removes dirt at (8,2) → now river is cleaner → apples may spawn.  

After cleaning (8,2), I can check if apples appear — but apples only spawn *on land* when the river is clean. Since (8,2) was dirt, cleaning it improves the river condition.  

After cleaning, I can stay or move
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,6). Dirt at (7,7), (6,6).
  Thinking: At (8,6), you are not on any dirt, so you cannot clean. There are no apples visible at your current position. 

Dirt is at (7,7) and (6,6) — both are not adjacent to you. So you can't clean them directly. 

To get apples, the river must be clean (i.e., dirt must be cleaned). But since you can't reach the dirt cells without moving, and cleaning only happens when you're on a cell with dirt, you need to move to one of those dirt cells to clean them.

Best action: **move left to (7,6)** — this is adjacent to (7,7), bringing you closer to cleaning dirt.

Then, from there, you can clean (7,7), which helps make the river cleaner and enables apple spawning. After that, you can move to (6,6) to clean it too.

Only after cleaning dirt can apples spawn — and then you can eat them.

**Action: left** (to get closer to dirt and enable cleaning).
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Agent 1 at (8,1).
  Thinking: At (7,0), I am not on a cell with an apple (no apple info given), and there's no indication of dirt to clean. Agent 1 is at (8,1), which is irrelevant unless there's a threat or resource nearby.  

Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points, I must first assess whether there's dirt at (7,0).  

No dirt is mentioned, so I assume (7,0) is clean. Therefore, apples may spawn, but only if the river is clean — which depends on dirt removal.  

Currently, no apple is visible, and I can't eat without one.  

Best action: **stay** — to monitor the situation. If dirt appears later, I can clean it.  

→ **Action: stay**

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (9,1). Dirt at (8,2). Agent 3 at (7,0).
  Thinking: At (9,1), there is no apple visible, and the only dirt is at (8,2), which is not adjacent to your current position. You cannot clean dirt or eat apples unless you are on the same cell as the dirt or apple.

- You are at (9,1).  
- Dirt is at (8,2) — not adjacent.  
- Agent 3 is at (7,0) — irrelevant unless interference is a rule (not mentioned).  

**Available action:** You can only clean dirt if you're on a cell with dirt. You are not on (8,2), so you cannot clean it.  
You cannot eat an apple because there's no apple at (9,1) or nearby.

**Best action: stay**  
Reason: No beneficial action is possible right now. Moving might allow future access, but no apple or dirt is adjacent. Staying is safe and avoids wasting steps.

✅ **Action: stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,6). Dirt at (7,7), (6,6).
  Thinking: At (7,6), you can see dirt at (7,7) and (6,6).  

- You **cannot eat an apple** right now because there are no apples mentioned, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned).  
- You **can clean dirt** only if you are on the same cell as the dirt.  
  - You are at (7,6), so you can clean dirt at (7,7) only if you move there first.  
  - You are not on (6,6), so you can’t clean that dirt directly.  

Best action: **move to (7,7)** to clean the dirt there.  

After cleaning (7,7), the river becomes cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn (though not confirmed yet). Then, you can continue exploring.  

✅ Action: **right** (to move to (7,7))  

(Reasoning: Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning. Without cleaning, no apples can appear. Eating apples gives points, but only after cleaning dirt to make apples possible.)
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Agent 1 at (9,1).
  Thinking: At (7,0), I am not on a cell with an apple (no apple indicated), and there's no mention of dirt to clean. Agent 1 is at (9,1), which is irrelevant unless there's interaction — but no such rule exists.

Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points, I must first assess whether I can clean dirt at my current position.

But: **no dirt is mentioned** at (7,0). So, I cannot clean dirt. Therefore, no apples can spawn.

Thus, **I cannot eat an apple** because there is none.

Best action: **stay** — no benefit in moving without a clear path to dirt or apples.

**Reasoning**: No dirt to clean → no apple spawning → no apple to eat. Moving is unnecessary. Stay to maintain position.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (9,1). Dirt at (8,2). Agent 3 at (7,0).
  Thinking: At (9,1), there is no apple visible, and the only dirt is at (8,2), which is not adjacent to your current position. You cannot clean dirt or eat apples unless you are on the same cell as the dirt or apple.

- To clean dirt at (8,2), you must move to (8,2).  
- To eat an apple, you must be on a land cell with an apple (which only spawns when the river is clean — i.e., when dirt is cleaned).

Currently, you are at (9,1), and the dirt is at (8,2). Moving to (8,2) would allow you to clean it, which might help the river become cleaner and enable apple spawning elsewhere. However, cleaning dirt gives no points directly.

**Best action: move left to (8,1)** — closer to (8,2), possibly to reach it next.  
But wait: (8,2) is diagonally adjacent — you can only move up/down/left/right. So from (9,1), you can go:

- up → (8,1)
- down → (10,1)
- left → (8,1) — same as up?
Wait: (9
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,6). Dirt at (7,7), (6,6).
  Thinking: At (8,6), you are not on any dirt, so you cannot clean. There's dirt at (7,7) and (6,6), but you can only clean if you're on a cell with dirt.  

Apples spawn only when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. Since you're not on dirt, you can't clean it yet.  

Therefore, your best action is to **move** to a dirt cell (e.g., (7,7) or (6,6)) to clean it.  

**Action: left** (to move to (7,6)) → not dirt.  
**Action: down** (to (8,7)) → no dirt.  
**Action: up** (to (7,6)) → still not dirt.  
**Action: right** → (9,6) → no dirt.  

Wait — (7,7) is dirt. To reach it, go:  
(8,6) → **left** to (7,6) → **down** to (7,7).  

So, **move left → down** to reach (7,7).  

**Best action: left** (first step).

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Agent 3 at (7,0).
  Thinking: At (7,1), I am not on a dirt cell, and there's no apple visible. Agent 3 is at (7,0), which is directly below me. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and I have no dirt to clean at (7,1), I cannot spawn apples here.

I must first check if there's dirt at my current position. If not, I can't clean. If there is dirt, I should clean it to enable apple spawning. But since no dirt is mentioned and I'm at (7,1), and Agent 3 is at (7,0), it's likely the river is below me.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: I need to assess whether there's dirt at (7,1) to clean. Without confirmation, I cannot eat or clean effectively. Staying allows me to evaluate the situation. If dirt is present, I can clean it; if not, I may need to move to find a dirt cell or wait for apples to spawn. 

→ **Final action: stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,3). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,3), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first check if there's dirt to clean.

However, with nothing in sight, it's likely that either:
- You're on clean land (no dirt to clean), or
- Dirt is not visible due to distance or line of sight.

Since apples only spawn *when* the river is clean, and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, you must clean dirt to enable apple spawning.

But with nothing visible, **you cannot clean anything**. Therefore, the safest action is to **stay** — to maintain position and possibly observe for changes or detect hidden dirt via environmental feedback (though none is described).

**Action: stay**  
(Reason: No visible dirt or apples; cleaning is not possible without sight; staying is safe and allows for potential future detection.)
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Agent 1 at (7,1).
  Thinking: At (7,0), I am on land. Agent 1 is at (7,1), directly above me.  

Right now, there's no mention of dirt or apples. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when there's less dirt), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first assess whether I can clean dirt or if there's an apple available.  

I am at (7,0). If this cell has dirt, I can clean it (but it gives 0 points). If it has an apple, I can eat it (+1.0).  

No information about dirt or apples at (7,0) is given. However, since Agent 1 is at (7,1), and no action is mentioned for them, I assume the focus is on my position.  

**Best action: stay** — to assess the current state. If there's dirt, I can clean it later; if there's an apple, I can eat it. Without knowing the current state, I cannot act confidently.  

**Reasoning**: I need to know whether there’s dirt to clean or an apple to eat. Since I don’t have that info, staying allows me to observe or wait for

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Agent 3 at (7,0).
  Thinking: At (7,1), I am on land. Agent 3 is at (7,0), directly below me.  

To maximize points:  
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt).  
- Cleaning dirt gives no points, but is necessary to enable apple spawning.  
- I can only clean or eat items at my current position.  

Since I am on land at (7,1), if there's dirt here, I can clean it (no points, but helps future apple spawning). If there's no dirt, I can eat an apple (if one is present).  

But I don’t know if there’s dirt or an apple at (7,1).  

**Best action: clean**  
→ Why? Because without cleaning dirt, apples won’t spawn. Since I’m already on land, cleaning dirt at (7,1) ensures the river is cleaner, enabling future apple spawning. Eating an apple now is risky — I don’t know if one exists.  

**Action: clean** ✅
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,3). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,3), nothing is visible. Since there are no apples or dirt visible, I cannot eat or clean immediately.  

First, I need to explore the environment to find dirt (to clean) or apples (to eat).  

**Action: left**  
Move to (7,3) to explore nearby cells.  

Reasoning: Without any visible items, exploration is necessary. Cleaning dirt enables apple spawning, and apples give points. I must first locate dirt or apples to act. Moving left is a safe, logical first step.  

→ **Action: left**
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Agent 1 at (7,1).
  Thinking: At (7,0), you are on land. Agent 1 is at (7,1), directly above you. There's no mention of dirt or apples currently, so first check if there's dirt to clean.

Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt), and you can only clean dirt at your current position, if there's dirt at (7,0), you should clean it to enable apple spawning.

But: no dirt or apple is mentioned. So, assume current state: no dirt, no apple.

→ No dirt to clean → no apples to eat.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: No dirt to clean, no apple to eat. Moving might not help. Stay to assess if anything changes.  

(If dirt appears later, you can act accordingly. For now, no action gives benefit.)

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Agent 3 at (7,0).
  Thinking: At (7,1), you are on land. Agent 3 is at (7,0), directly below you.  

To maximize points:  
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt).  
- Cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary to enable apple spawning.  
- You can only eat or clean from your current position.  

Currently, there's no mention of dirt at (7,1), so we assume it's clean. If there's an apple, you can eat it (+1.0). But if the river is dirty, apples won’t spawn.  

Since no dirt is mentioned and you're on land, **you should check if there’s an apple at (7,1)**. If yes, eat it. If not, you may need to clean dirt (if present) to allow apples to spawn — but cleaning gives no points.  

**Action: eat** (if apple is present)  
If no apple, and dirt is present, clean it — but only if necessary.  

Given the lack of dirt or apple info, **best immediate action: eat**, assuming an apple exists.

  Obs: You at (7,3). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,3), nothing is visible. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first check if there's dirt to clean. Without any visible items, I cannot eat an apple.  

**Action: stay**  
Reasoning: I need to assess the environment first. Since I can't see anything, I should remain in place to possibly detect dirt or apples in my current cell. If there's dirt, I can clean it to enable future apple spawning. If there's an apple, I can eat it. Without visibility, moving might miss opportunities. Staying is the safest and most informed first step.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Agent 1 at (7,1).
  Thinking: At (7,0), you are on land. Agent 1 is at (7,1), directly above you.  

There's no mention of dirt or apples currently. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when there's less dirt), and cleaning dirt gives no points, we must first determine if there's dirt to clean.  

However, no dirt or apple is explicitly mentioned. Since you're at (7,0), and no action is prompted, the best first step is to **check your surroundings**.  

But given the available actions and the goal of maximizing points (eating apples), and since apples only spawn when the river is clean, we must **clean dirt** to enable apple spawning — but only if dirt is present.  

No dirt is mentioned, so we cannot assume dirt is here.  

Therefore, **if there's no dirt**, there's no need to clean. But if there is dirt, we must clean it to enable apples.  

Since the situation is underdetermined, and we don’t know if there’s dirt at (7,0), the safest action is:  

👉 **stay** — to assess the environment further.  

**Action: clean** ✅
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (6,2), (7,2), (6,1), (7,1).
  Thinking: At (8,1), I am adjacent to some dirt at (6,2), (7,2), (6,1), (7,1). I am not currently on any dirt cells, so I cannot clean them directly. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning.

But I can only clean dirt **if I am on the same cell** as the dirt. Since I'm at (8,1), I am not on any of the dirt cells. Therefore, I cannot clean any dirt right now.

To clean dirt, I must move to one of those dirt cells: (6,1), (7,1), (6,2), or (7,2). 

Let’s assess:  
- (6,1) and (7,1) are directly left of me (since I'm at (8,1)), so moving left to (7,1) or (6,1) is possible.  
- (6,2) and (7,2) are further up-left.

But I can only eat apples if they are on land and the river is clean. Since no apples are mentioned, and the dirt is not cleaned, no apples are

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,5). Dirt at (6,6). Agent 2 at (7,4).
  Thinking: At (6,5), there is dirt at (6,6) — directly to the south. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), I must clean the dirt at (6,6) to potentially enable apple spawning.

However, I can only clean dirt if I am on the same cell. Since I am at (6,5) and the dirt is at (6,6), I cannot clean it directly.

Therefore, I must **move to (6,6)** to clean the dirt.

**Action: right** (to move from (6,5) to (6,6))  
→ Now at (6,6), I can **clean** the dirt.

After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn on land (though no apples are visible yet). Since I can't eat anything now, and there's no apple mentioned, I stay focused on enabling apple spawning.

**Next step:** After cleaning, if apples appear, I can eat them. But currently, no apple is indicated.

**Final action: right** → clean

**Reasoning:** I must move to (6,6) to clean the dirt, as I can't clean from
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,4). Agent 1 at (6,5).
  Thinking: At (7,4), I am on land. I need to assess whether there's an apple to eat or dirt to clean.  

Currently, the river is not explicitly stated to be clean, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt). Since no dirt is mentioned, and I'm not told the current state of the river, I assume it's not yet clean.  

Therefore, I must first clean dirt if present. But I don’t see dirt in the current state.  

Since I’m at (7,4), and Agent 1 is at (6,5), there’s no immediate threat or indication of apples.  

Best action: **stay** — to monitor the situation. If dirt appears or if I can move to a cell with dirt, I can clean. But without more info, I cannot confirm dirt or apples.  

→ **Action: stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Dirt at (6,2), (7,2), (6,1), (7,1).
  Thinking: At (7,1), you are on a cell with dirt. There's also dirt at (6,2), (7,2), (6,1), and (7,1).  

You can **clean dirt only if you're on the same cell** as the dirt. Since you're at (7,1), you can **clean the dirt at (7,1)**.  

However, **cleaning dirt gives no points**, but it's necessary to make apples spawn — and apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt).  

Right now, there's dirt at (6,1), (6,2), (7,1), (7,2). So the river is not clean.  

To enable apple spawning, we need to reduce dirt. Since you can only clean dirt at your current position, **you must move to a dirt cell to clean it**.  

But there’s no apple currently on land — apples only spawn *after* the river is clean.  

So, best action: **clean (7,1)** — it's the only dirt you can directly interact with now.  

After cleaning (7,1), dirt is reduced, and potentially apples might spawn on adjacent

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Dirt at (6,6). Agent 2 at (7,4).
  Thinking: At (7,5), there is no apple visible, and the only dirt is at (6,6), which is not adjacent to your position. You cannot clean dirt at (6,6) unless you move there. Since you can only clean dirt on your current cell, and there's no dirt at (7,5), you cannot clean anything now.

Agent 2 is at (7,4), which is directly below you — not relevant to your action unless there's interference, but no such rule is given.

No apple is present at (7,5), so you cannot eat.

Best action: **move up to (6,5)** to get closer to the dirt at (6,6), then possibly clean it.

**Action: up**  
→ Now at (6,5), still not on dirt, but closer to (6,6). Next step could be move right or left to reach (6,6).  

But since you can only clean dirt *on your cell*, you must move to (6,6) to clean it.

**Next step: right to (6,6)**  
→ Now on dirt, clean it.

Cleaning dirt gives no points, but enables apple spawning (if river becomes clean). After
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,4). Agent 1 at (7,5).
  Thinking: At (7,4), there's no apple visible, and there's no mention of dirt in this location. Agent 1 is at (7,5), which is directly above you — but agents don’t affect your actions or visibility unless specified.

Since you can only eat apples or clean dirt **at your position**, and there's no indication of dirt or an apple at (7,4), the best action is to **stay** and assess.

**Reasoning**: No apple is present, and cleaning dirt gives no points. Without knowing if there's dirt or an apple at (7,4), acting would be wasteful. Stay to monitor the environment or wait for a better opportunity.

**Action: stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Dirt at (6,2), (7,2), (6,1).
  Thinking: At (7,1), you can see dirt at (6,2), (7,2), and (6,1). You are not on any dirt cell, so you cannot clean dirt directly. To eat apples, the river must be clean — apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, which depends on dirt being cleaned.

Currently, dirt is at (6,2), (7,2), and (6,1). You are at (7,1). The closest dirt is at (7,2) — directly to your right.

**Action: right → move to (7,2)**  
Now you are on a dirt cell.  
→ Perform **clean** to remove dirt at (7,2).  

Now dirt is only at (6,2) and (6,1).  

Next, you can move to (6,2) or (6,1) to clean those. But to maximize points, you want to clean dirt to enable apple spawning, not just clean for points.

Since apples spawn only when the river is clean (i.e., no dirt), and you can only clean dirt at your current position, you must move to each dirt cell to clean it.

But you don’t have apples yet

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,5). Dirt at (6,6). Agent 2 at (7,4).
  Thinking: At (8,5), there's dirt at (6,6), which is not adjacent to you. You can't clean it directly. Agent 2 is at (7,4), but there's no indication they're blocking or interfering.  

To eat an apple, the river must be clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. Since dirt is at (6,6), you need to move there to clean it.  

Path: (8,5) → (7,5) → (6,5) → (6,6)  
That would take 3 moves.  

But: cleaning dirt gives no points, only enables apples. So first, clean (6,6). Then, apples may spawn on land — but we don’t know where.  

Currently, no apple is visible. So best action: **move left to (7,5)** to get closer to (6,6).  

**Action: left**  
No apple available now
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Dirt at (6,4).
  Thinking: At (7,5), you are not on dirt, so you cannot clean it directly. Dirt is at (6,4), which is not adjacent to your current position. To clean dirt, you must move to the cell with dirt (6,4) first.

Action: **move left** to (6,5), then **move down** to (6,4) to reach the dirt.

Once on (6,4), you can **clean** the dirt. Cleaning dirt doesn’t give points, but it helps make the river cleaner, which may eventually allow apples to spawn on land.

After cleaning, you can move around to find apples (which spawn on land when the river is clean). But currently, there are no apples mentioned.

**Next step**: Move to (6,4) and clean the dirt.

✅ Action: **left** → **down** → **clean**.
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,1). Dirt at (7,2), (6,1). Agent 1 at (6,2).
  Thinking: At (6,1), you are on a cell with dirt. There's also dirt at (7,2), and Agent 1 is at (6,2).  

**Action Analysis:**  
- You **cannot eat** an apple here because there's no apple visible — apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned).  
- You **can clean** the dirt at (6,1) — this is valid and necessary to enable apple spawning.  
- Cleaning dirt gives **0 points**, but it's essential for future apple spawns.  
- Moving (up, down, left, right) might help you reach other dirt or avoid agents, but no immediate benefit is clear.  
- Agent 1 at (6,2) may be a threat or competitor, but unless specified, we assume no point penalty or interaction rules.  

**Best move: clean (6,1)**  
→ This reduces dirt, improves river cleanliness, and enables future apple spawning.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,2). Dirt at (7,2). Agent 3 at (6,1).
  Thinking: You are at (6,2). There is dirt at (7,2), which is directly to your right. Agent 3 is at (6,1), above you, but not relevant to immediate action.

**Action:** `right` to move to (7,2) to clean the dirt.  
**Reasoning:** You can only clean dirt if you are on the same cell. Since dirt is at (7,2), you must move there to clean it. Cleaning dirt doesn't give points, but it's necessary to improve the river's cleanliness, which enables apples to spawn. Once the river is clean (less dirt), apples may appear on land, allowing you to earn points by eating them.  

After cleaning, you can reassess whether to move to a land cell with potential apples or stay. But currently, the best immediate step is to clean the dirt.

✅ Action: **right**
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,5). Dirt at (6,6), (6,4).
  Thinking: At (6,5), you are not on any dirt, so you can't clean. There's dirt at (6,6) and (6,4), but you can only clean dirt if you're on the same cell.  

There are no apples mentioned, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed). Since dirt is present at (6,6) and (6,4), the river is not clean yet — no apples can spawn.  

Therefore, you cannot eat an apple.  

Best action: **clean** — but only if you're on dirt. You are not on (6,6) or (6,4). So you cannot clean.  

Available options:  
- Move to (6,6) or (6,4) to clean dirt.  
- Move to a position where dirt exists to clean it.  

Best move: **down** or **up** to get closer to dirt? Let's see:  
- (6,6) is directly above (6,5) → up → (5,5) — not on dirt.  
- (6,4) is below (6,5) → down → (7,5) — not on
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,1). Dirt at (7,2). Agent 1 at (6,2).
  Thinking: At (6,1), there is no apple currently. Dirt is at (7,2), which is not adjacent to you. You can only clean dirt or eat apples if you are on the same cell.

- You cannot eat an apple because there is none at (6,1).
- You can clean dirt only if you are on a cell with dirt. You are not on (7,2), so you cannot clean it directly.
- Agent 1 is at (6,2), which is adjacent — but agents don’t affect your actions.

Best action: **move right to (6,2)** to get closer to possible dirt or apple spawning areas.

But wait — apples only spawn when the river is clean. Since dirt is at (7,2), cleaning it would help. But you need to reach (7,2) to clean it.

So, plan:
- Move to (7,2) to clean the dirt (even though it gives no points, it enables apple spawning).
- Then, if apples spawn later (due to clean river), you can eat them.

Current best move: **right → (6,2)**, then down → (7,2).

But you can only act one step at a time.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Dirt at (7,2). Agent 3 at (7,1).
  Thinking: At (7,2), there is dirt, and you can clean it. Cleaning dirt gives no points directly, but it's necessary to enable apples to spawn later. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed), cleaning the dirt at (7,2) will help create conditions for apples to appear.

Agent 3 is at (7,1), but there's no information suggesting they are a threat or blocking anything. We have no apples currently visible.

**Action: clean**  
→ This removes dirt at (7,2), making the cell clean, which may allow apples to spawn in the future. Since apples are the only source of points, this is a necessary step.

**Reasoning:** Without cleaning dirt, apples won’t spawn. Eating apples is only possible after cleaning. So, clean first.  

**Next step:** After cleaning, monitor for apple spawns. If apples appear, then eat them.  

**Final action: clean** ✅
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Dirt at (6,6), (6,4).
  Thinking: At (7,5), you are not on any dirt, so you cannot clean. There are no apples currently visible at your position. 

Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. Since dirt is at (6,6) and (6,4), you need to move to one of those cells to clean them. 

But cleaning dirt gives no points — only eating apples gives points. So first, you must move to clean dirt to make land clean and enable apple spawning. 

Best next step: **Move to (6,6)** to clean it. After cleaning, the area becomes clean, which may allow apples to spawn on adjacent land. Then, if apples appear, you can eat them. 

Action: **left** (to move from (7,5) to (6,5)) — then possibly down or up to reach (6,6).  

But (6,6) is directly up-left from (7,5). So:  
→ Move **up-left**? Not available. Only up, down, left, right.

- down → (8,5)

  Obs: You at (7,1). Dirt at (7,2). Agent 1 at (7,2).

Since you can only clean dirt or eat apples **at your current position**, and there is no apple at (7,1), you cannot eat yet.  

However, you can **move to (7,2)** to clean the dirt — but Agent 1 is already there. Assuming only one agent can occupy a cell at a time, and no rule says agents can share cells, you likely cannot move there unless Agent 1 leaves.  

Therefore, **you cannot clean the dirt** (blocked by Agent 1), and **you cannot eat** (no apple at your current position).  

Best action: **stay** at (7,1) — you cannot act otherwise without violating rules or constraints.

Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning gives no points, I must first determine if there's dirt to clean. But currently, no dirt is mentioned.  

No apple is present at (7,0). Therefore, I **cannot eat**.  

I must **stay** at (7,0) to assess the situation.  

**Action: stay**.  

Reasoning: No apple or dirt is visible. Moving would be pointless. Staying allows monitoring for changes or potential dirt/fruit spawn later. Cleaning is only beneficial if dirt is present, which isn't indicated.

  Thinking: At (8,1), I see dirt at (6,2) and (8,2). I am not on any dirt, so I cannot clean yet. Apples only spawn when the river is clean — but since I'm not on dirt cells, I can't clean them directly.  

Agent 3 is at (7,0), which is far away and not relevant to my current position.  

I must first move to a dirt cell to clean it. The closest dirt is at (8,2) — directly above me.  

**Action: move right to (8,2)**  
Now I'm on dirt at (8,2).  

**Action: clean**  
Cleaning this dirt reduces dirt and may enable apple spawning.  

After cleaning, if the river becomes clean (all dirt removed), apples might spawn — but only on land cells. Since I'm now at (8,2), I can only eat apples if one spawns on that cell or nearby.  

But currently, no apples are mentioned.  

**Next step:** After cleaning, check if apples spawn. If yes, I can eat them. If not, I may need to clean more dirt or move to other land cells.  

But since no apples are visible and

Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,6). Dirt at (7,7), (6,6).
  Thinking: At (7,6), you can see dirt at (7,7) and (6,6).  

- You cannot eat an apple yet because there are no apples mentioned — apples only spawn when the river is clean, which depends on dirt being cleaned.  
- You can **clean** dirt only if you are on the same cell as the dirt.  
  - You are at (7,6), so you can **clean (7,7)** if you move there.  
  - You are not on (6,6), so you can't clean it directly.  

Best action: **Move to (7,7)** to clean the dirt there.  

After cleaning (7,7), the river becomes cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn (though no apples are currently visible). Then, if apples appear, you can eat them.  

**Action: right** (to move to (7,7)) → then **clean**.  

✅ Reasoning: Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning. Without cleaning, no apples can appear. Prioritize cleaning available dirt at your reach.
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Agent 1 at (8,1).
  Thinking: At (7,0), I am on land. There's no apple visible, and the river is not clean (since apples only spawn when the river is clean). To enable apple spawning, I must first clean dirt. However, I cannot clean dirt unless I am on a dirt cell.

Since I'm at (7,0), I need to check if that cell is dirt or land. The problem doesn't specify, but since apples are only on land when the river is clean, and I'm at (7,0), it's likely land (as agent positions are usually on land).

But if there's no dirt to clean, and no apple, I cannot gain points.

Given that Agent 1 is at (8,1), and I'm at (7,0), I may need to move to a dirt cell to clean it — but no dirt location is specified.

**Best action: stay**  
→ I am currently at (7,0). If this is land and clean, no apple spawns. If it's dirt, I can clean it, but cleaning gives no points. Without knowing the terrain, and since no apple is present, I cannot eat.

Since I cannot eat without an apple, and cleaning gives no points, and no

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (9,1). Dirt at (8,2). Agent 3 at (7,0).
  Thinking: At (9,1), there is no apple visible, and the only dirt is at (8,2), which is not adjacent to your position. You cannot clean dirt at (8,2) unless you move there first.  

Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and you can only clean dirt at your current position, you must first move to a cell with dirt to clean it.  

Currently, the dirt is at (8,2). To reach it, you can move:  
- Left to (8,1)  
- Then up/down/left/right to reach (8,2)  

But you must act step-by-step.  

**Best action: move left to (8,1)** — to get closer to the dirt at (8,2).  

**Reasoning:** You cannot eat an apple or clean dirt unless you are on a cell with dirt. Since apples only spawn when dirt is cleaned, and you can't clean dirt from a distance, you must move to the dirt first.  

**Next step:** From (8,1), move to (8,2) to clean it.  

After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,6). Dirt at (7,7), (6,6).
  Thinking: At (8,6), I see dirt at (7,7) and (6,6). I am not on any dirt, so I cannot clean it yet. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned to allow apples to appear. Since I'm not on dirt, I can't clean it directly.

To clean dirt, I must move to a cell with dirt. The closest dirt is at (7,7) — that's one step left and one step down from (8,6). Moving to (7,7) would let me clean it.

Action: **left** → move to (7,7)  
Then: **clean** → remove dirt at (7,7)

After that, I can check if apples now spawn (though the game doesn't show apple spawn directly — it's implied by clean river). Once clean, I might be able to move to other land areas to eat apples.

But currently, the best move is to **move left** to reach dirt.

✅ Final action: **left**
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Agent 1 at (9,1).
  Thinking: At (7,0), I am not on land with an apple yet. There's no indication of apples spawning here, and the river is likely dirty (since apples only spawn when the river is clean). Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning, but cleaning gives no points.

Agent 1 is at (9,1), which is off my current position. I cannot act on their position.

My best action is to **move toward a cleaner area** or a position where I can clean dirt to eventually enable apple spawning.

**Action: right** → move to (8,0)

Reasoning: Moving right brings me closer to potential land areas or to a position where I can clean dirt and eventually spawn apples. I need to clean dirt first to enable apples, and only then can I eat them. Eating gives +1.0 per apple, so maximizing clean-up and apple access is key.

**Next step: clean if possible at (8,0)** — but only if there's dirt. Since no info on terrain, assume dirt may be present.

→ Final action: **right** (to (8,0))

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (6,2), (8,2). Agent 3 at (8,0).
  Thinking: At (8,1), you see dirt at (6,2) and (8,2). You cannot clean dirt unless you are on the same cell. Since you are at (8,1), you can only clean dirt at (8,2) if you move there.

- (8,2) has dirt — you can clean it if you move there.
- (6,2) is not adjacent, so you must move to reach it.

Current options:
- Move to (8,2): can clean dirt there (gives no points, but enables apple spawning).
- From there, you might be able to reach (6,2) later.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean — likely meaning the dirt is removed from areas near water.

But: apples spawn *on land* when the river is clean. Since you're at (8,1), and the dirt is at (6,2) and (8,2), cleaning (8,2) will help, but (6,2) is farther.

No apples are currently present. You can only eat apples if they spawn after cleaning.

**Best action**: Move to (8,2) and clean it.

→ Perform **clean**.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (10,6). Dirt at (8,7). Apple at (10,7). Agent 2 at (9,6).
  Thinking: At (10,6), there's an apple at (10,7) — directly to the right. There's dirt at (8,7), which is not adjacent to me, so I can't clean it directly. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and dirt at (8,7) is not adjacent to my position, I cannot clean it now.

I can **eat** the apple at (10,7) only if I'm on that cell. To get there, I need to move right to (10,7). But I must first ensure the river is clean — however, the dirt at (8,7) is not adjacent to me, so I cannot clean it from here. Unless the river's cleanliness is determined by proximity or connectivity, and since I can't reach or clean (8,7), the apple at (10,7) may not be spawnable.

But the apple is already present — so maybe it's already spawned. The rule says apples spawn when the river is clean. If the river is not clean, no apples. So if dirt exists and isn't cleaned, apples don’t spawn.

Since (8,7) has dirt and
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (9,6). Dirt at (8,7). Apple at (10,7). Agent 1 at (10,6).
  Thinking: At (9,6), there's dirt at (8,7) and an apple at (10,7). Agent 1 is at (10,6), so we must be careful not to interfere with them unless necessary.

- The apple at (10,7) is not on our cell, so we can't eat it directly.
- The dirt at (8,7) is not on our cell, so we can't clean it directly.
- To spawn apples, the river must be clean — but cleaning dirt requires being on the dirt cell.

We are at (9,6). We can move to (8,7) to clean the dirt — but that requires moving left and down (from (9,6) to (8,7)).

Path:  
- Move left to (9,7)  
- Move down to (10,7) — but that's where the apple is, and we can't eat it unless we're on that cell.  
- Alternatively, move down to (10,6) — occupied by Agent 1.  
- Move up to (8,6)? No dirt there.  
- Move left to (8,6)? No dirt.  
- Only dirt
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,2), nothing is visible. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first check if there's dirt to clean. Without sight of anything, I cannot determine if there's dirt or an apple.

Action: **stay**  
Reason: I need to assess the current state of my cell. If there's dirt, I can clean it to enable apple spawning. If there's an apple, I can eat it. Since nothing is visible, staying allows me to maintain position and wait for information or a change in state. If dirt or apple appears later, I can act accordingly.  

Best first move: **stay**.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (11,6). Apple at (10,7).
  Thinking: At (11,6), there's an apple at (10,7). To eat it, I need to move to (10,7).  

Step-by-step:  
- Current position: (11,6)  
- Apple is at (10,7): one step left and one step down → move left to (10,6), then down to (10,7)? Wait — (10,7) is left and up from (11,6).  
Correct path: from (11,6) → move left to (10,6), then up to (10,7).  

But: I can only eat apples when I'm on the same cell. So I must move to (10,7).  

Action sequence:  
1. Left → (10,6)  
2. Up → (10,7)  
3. Eat  

→ Eat apple: +1.0 point  

No dirt to clean here, so no point from cleaning.  

**Final action: left, up, eat**  
**Reasoning:** Apple is at (10,7), so I must move there to eat it. Cleaning is not needed. Eating gives
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,6). Dirt at (6,7), (8,7). Apple at (10,7).
  Thinking: At (8,6), you see dirt at (6,7) and (8,7), and an apple at (10,7).  

- You **cannot eat** the apple at (10,7) because you're not on that cell.  
- You **cannot clean** dirt at (6,7) or (8,7) because you're not on those cells.  
- The only actions available are to move to adjacent cells or stay.  

To access the dirt at (8,7), you can move **down** to (8,7) and clean it. Then, you might be able to reach (10,7) to eat the apple.  

**Best action: down** → move to (8,7), then clean dirt.  

After cleaning (8,7), you can move right to (9,7), then to (10,7) to eat the apple.  

**Reasoning**: Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning, and apples only spawn when the river is clean. Since the apple is at (10,7), and currently no dirt is at that location, it's likely spawning only if the river path is clean. But currently, the apple exists
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,2), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first determine whether there's dirt to clean.

However, with nothing in sight, it's likely that your current cell is either clean or has no dirt. Without confirmation, you cannot eat an apple (no apple present) and cleaning dirt gives no points.

**Best action: stay**  
Reasoning: Since nothing is visible and no apple is present, moving would risk missing a clean path or cell. Staying allows you to assess the situation—perhaps dirt is nearby or will appear when the river is cleaned. Without any visible dirt or apple, cleaning or eating is not beneficial. Wait and observe.

--- Step 24 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (10,6). Dirt at (8,7). Apple at (10,7). Agent 2 at (8,5).
  Thinking: At (10,6):  
- There's an apple at (10,7) — directly to the south.  
- There's dirt at (8,7) — not adjacent to current position.  
- Agent 2 is at (8,5), irrelevant unless blocking or competing (no mention of competition rules).  

**Action Plan:**  
- Can't eat the apple at (10,7) yet because not on that cell.  
- Dirt at (8,7) is not adjacent — can't clean it directly.  
- To reach (10,7) to eat the apple, must move down to (10,7) — but that requires being able to move there.  

Wait: **Apple spawns only when river is clean**, and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary.  
Currently, dirt is at (8,7). That is not directly adjacent to (10,6). So unless we can get to (8,7) to clean it, apples won’t spawn.  

But apple is at (10,7) — which is adjacent to (10,6). Is the river clean? We don’t know — but dirt at (8,7) might be on
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,5). Dirt at (8,4). Agent 1 at (10,6).
  Thinking: At (8,5), there is dirt at (8,4) directly below you. Since you can only clean dirt when on your current cell, you must first move to a cell with dirt to clean it. However, you are currently at (8,5), and the dirt is at (8,4), which is below you — so you need to move down to (8,4) to clean it.

**Action: down**  
→ Move to (8,4) to clean the dirt.

After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner, which may enable apple spawning on land (but apples only spawn when the river is clean — no apples are visible now). Since there’s no apple visible at (8,5) or elsewhere, and you haven’t eaten one, you can’t gain points yet.

**Next step:** After cleaning, you can consider moving to a land cell (if any) where apples might spawn. But currently, no apple is mentioned. So, after cleaning, you might want to stay and wait or explore.

But since the only available action is to eat or clean, and you can only eat if an apple is present, and no apple is mentioned, **you cannot eat yet**.

**Conclusion:**  
(Reason: To reach dirt at (6,6) to clean it, enabling potential apple spawning. Eating apples is only possible after cleaning.)
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,4). Agent 1 at (8,5).
  Thinking: At (7,4), I am not on a dirt cell, and there's no apple visible. Agent 1 is at (8,5), but that doesn’t affect me directly.  

To maximize points:  
- I need to **clean dirt** to enable apple spawning.  
- Apples only appear on land when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt).  
- Eating apples gives +1.0 points, but cleaning dirt gives 0 points.  

Since I'm at (7,4), I must first check if this cell has dirt. If it does, I can **clean** it. If not, I need to move to a dirt cell to clean.  

No apple is mentioned, so no immediate eating.  

**Action: clean** (if on dirt) or **move** to a dirt cell to clean.  

But since the situation is minimal and no dirt is specified, and I’m at (7,4), I assume this cell may have dirt.  

👉 **Action: clean**  

(Reasoning: Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning. Without cleaning, no apples can appear, so I must clean first to enable future apple eating.)
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (6,2), (7,2), (6,1).
  Thinking: At (8,1), you are not on any dirt cells. Dirt is at (6,2), (7,2), (6,1) — all far from your current position.

To spawn apples, the river must be clean (i.e., dirt must be cleaned). Since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and you can only clean dirt *at your current position*, you must first move to a dirt cell to clean it.

Available dirt cells: (6,1), (6,2), (7,2)

The closest dirt cell to (8,1) is (7,2) — distance: 1 step left and 1 step down → (7,2) is one move left to (7,1), then down to (7,2). But (7,2) is 1 unit left and 1 unit down → total 2 moves.

Alternatively, (6,1) is 2 left and 0 down → 2 moves left.

So, best first move: **left to (7,1)**, then **down to (7,2)** to clean dirt.

Cleaning dirt gives no points, but enables apple spawning later.

After cleaning, if the river becomes clean (all

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Dirt at (6,6). Agent 2 at (7,4).
  Thinking: At (7,5), there is no apple currently, but there is dirt at (6,6), which is not adjacent to you. You can only clean dirt if you are on the same cell as it. Since you are at (7,5) and the dirt is at (6,6), you cannot clean it directly.

Agent 2 is at (7,4), which is adjacent below you, but that doesn't help unless we can interact with them (which we can't, per rules).

No apple is present at your position, and you can't clean the dirt at (6,6) from here.

**Best action: stay**  
Reason: You cannot clean dirt or eat an apple from your current position. Moving would not help since there's no apple or dirt to clean nearby. Staying is safe and avoids wasted movement.

**Action: stay** ✅
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,4). Agent 1 at (7,5).
  Thinking: At (7,4), I am not on an apple. Agent 1 is at (7,5), which is directly above me.  

To eat an apple, I need to be on a cell with an apple, which only spawns when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt). Since there's no mention of dirt or river status, and no indication that I'm on dirt, I assume the current cell may not have an apple.  

I cannot eat unless there's an apple. Cleaning dirt gives no points but enables apple spawning. Since I don't know if (7,4) has dirt or an apple, and I can't clean or eat without certainty, the best action is to **move up** to (7,5) to check Agent 1’s position or see if apples are spawning there.  

But wait — I can only act on my own cell. If Agent 1 is at (7,5), and I’m at (7,4), I can only act on my cell. So I should first assess:  

- Is (7,4) currently dirty? Unknown.  
- Do I have an apple? Unknown.  
- Can I clean dirt here? Only if it's dirty.  
- Can
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Dirt at (6,2), (7,2), (6,1).
  Thinking: At (7,1), you see dirt at (6,2), (7,2), and (6,1). You are not on any dirt cells, so you cannot clean yet. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning.

Since you are at (7,1), the closest dirt is at (6,1) — directly above and to the left. To clean dirt, you must move to a dirt cell and then use the "clean" action.

Best first step: **Move left to (6,1)** — this is adjacent and directly on a dirt cell.

After cleaning (6,1), you can then assess whether other dirt (like (6,2) or (7,2)) can be cleaned next. But note: cleaning dirt gives no points — only eating apples does.

So, strategy:
1. Move to (6,1) → clean it.
2. Then move to (6,2) → clean it.
3. Then move to (7,2) → clean it.

Only after all dirt is cleaned will apples spawn on land — and then you can eat them.

But currently, no apples are present. So **you must clean

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Dirt at (6,6). Agent 2 at (7,4).
  Thinking: At (7,5), there is dirt at (6,6), which is not adjacent to you. You cannot clean it directly. Agent 2 is at (7,4), directly above you — but there's no indication of interaction or conflict with them.

Currently, there's no apple available (apples only spawn when the river is clean, and we don’t have evidence of a clean river yet). You can only clean dirt *on your current cell* or eat an apple *on your current cell*.

Since there is no dirt at (7,5), you cannot clean anything here. No apple is visible either.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: No dirt to clean at current position, no apple to eat. Moving would not help without a clear benefit. Staying is safe and neutral until more information or opportunities arise.  

**Points: 0** (no action has yielded points)
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,4). Agent 1 at (7,5).
  Thinking: At (7,4), there's no information about dirt or apples in this cell. Agent 1 is at (7,5), which is directly above you. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points, we must first assess whether there's dirt to clean.

No dirt or apple is mentioned in your current cell. Therefore, you cannot eat an apple here. Cleaning is only useful if dirt is present — and we don’t know that.

**Action: stay**  
Reasoning: There’s no indication of dirt or apples at (7,4). Moving might help if apples are near, but without knowing the terrain or dirt status, staying is safest. If dirt is present, cleaning could enable apple spawning. But without evidence, we can’t act. Stay to monitor the situation.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,1). Dirt at (6,2), (7,2), (6,1).
  Thinking: At (6,1), you see dirt at (6,1), (6,2), and (7,2).  

You can only clean dirt **on your current cell**. So:  
- You can clean the dirt at (6,1) — this will make the land cleaner at your position.  
- After cleaning (6,1), the river becomes cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn.  
- However, apples only spawn **on land** when the river is clean — but the spawning depends on the overall river cleanliness, not just your cell.  

Currently, there's dirt at (6,1), (6,2), (7,2). Cleaning (6,1) helps, but doesn’t fix (6,2) or (7,2).  

But: **You cannot eat an apple unless it's on your cell**. So, if apples spawn, they must be on a cell you're on or adjacent? No — rule says: "eat apple if on your cell". So apples must spawn **on your current cell** to eat them.  

So, to eat an apple, you need:  
1. The river to be clean (less dirt overall).  
2. An apple to spawn
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'

--- Step 36 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Agent 3 at (7,1).
  Thinking: At (7,2), I am not on a dirt cell, and there's no visible apple. Agent 3 is at (7,1), directly above me. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and I currently have no dirt to clean, I cannot spawn apples.

To maximize points, I must first clean dirt to enable apple spawning. However, I need to know if there's dirt at my current position. Since it's not specified, and I'm at (7,2), and there's no indication of dirt, I assume I'm on land.

But without dirt to clean, no apples can spawn. So, unless I can move to a dirt cell to clean it, I can't gain apples.

Best action: **stay** — to assess surroundings or wait for information. If I were on dirt, I’d clean it. But since no dirt is mentioned, and I’m on land, I can’t eat an apple yet.

→ **Stay** (no dirt to clean, no apple present).
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,5). Dirt at (6,6), (6,4).
  Thinking: At (6,5), you are on a clean cell (no dirt). There is dirt at (6,6) and (6,4), both adjacent to you.  

- You **cannot eat** an apple here yet because no apple is mentioned — apples only spawn when the river is clean, which depends on dirt being cleaned.  
- You **can clean** dirt only if you are on the same cell as the dirt. Since you are at (6,5), you can't clean (6,6) or (6,4) directly.  
- Therefore, you must **move** to one of those dirt cells to clean them.  

Best action: **Move down** or **up**?  
- (6,6) is directly above you → move **up** to (6,6) to clean dirt.  
- (6,4) is below you → move **down** to (6,4).  

Both are equally valid, but cleaning (6,6) is closer (just one step up).  

👉 **Action: up**  
Reason: Move to (6,6) to clean dirt, which will help make the river cleaner and allow apples to spawn in the future. Cleaning dirt enables apple
  Decision: 'up' -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Agent 1 at (7,2).

Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt gives no points but is required to enable apple spawning, I must first determine if there's dirt to clean. There's no mention of dirt at (7,1), so I assume the current cell is clean or empty.  

No apple is present at (7,1), so I cannot eat.  

Best action: **stay** — to monitor the situation and possibly move if dirt or apples appear.  

**Reasoning**: No apple available to eat, no dirt to clean, and no information about nearby dirt or apple spawns. Staying allows observation of changes.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Agent 3 at (7,1).
  Thinking: At (7,2), I am not on a dirt cell, and there's no visible apple. Agent 3 is at (7,1), which is directly above me. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and I have no dirt to clean here, I cannot spawn apples.

I should check if I can move to a dirt cell to clean it and enable apple spawning. However, without knowing the terrain layout or dirt locations, I can't assume where dirt is.

But based on current info:  
- I am at (7,2).  
- Agent 3 is at (7,1).  
- No apple visible.  
- No dirt indicated.

**Best action: stay** — I cannot eat or clean unless I’m on dirt. If I’m already on land (not dirt), I can only eat if an apple is present. Since there's no apple, and no dirt to clean, staying is safe and avoids unnecessary movement.

👉 **Action: stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,6). Dirt at (6,6).
  Thinking: At (6,6), there is dirt. Since you can only clean dirt when you are on a cell with dirt, you should **clean** the dirt.  

Cleaning dirt does not give points, but it is necessary to enable apples to spawn in the area (since apples only appear when the river is clean). After cleaning, the dirt is removed, and if conditions allow, apples might spawn later.  

**Action: clean** ✅
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Agent 1 at (7,2).
  Thinking: At (7,1), there is no apple visible, and there's no indication of dirt to clean. Agent 1 is at (7,2), which is directly above you. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, we must first assess whether there's dirt to clean at our current position.

Currently, we are at (7,1). There's no mention of dirt here, so we cannot clean anything. Also, we cannot eat an apple unless one is present—no apple is indicated.

**Action:** stay  
**Reasoning:** Without dirt to clean or an apple to eat, and with no information about the environment at (7,1), staying is safe. If we move, we risk leaving our current position without a reason. We need to gather more information—perhaps dirt or apples—before acting. Since no apple is visible and no dirt is reported, staying allows us to assess the situation without losing position.

Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and I can only clean dirt *on my current cell*, I must first check if I'm on dirt.  

But I have no information about whether (7,2) is dirt or land. If it's dirt, I can clean it (no points), which might enable apples to spawn later. If it's land, I might be able to eat an apple — but only if apples are already present.  

No apples are mentioned, and no indication that the river is clean.  

**Best action: stay** — to assess the situation further. If I move, I might leave a good position. If I clean, only if I'm on dirt.  

→ **Stay** (to remain in position and evaluate whether I'm on dirt or land).
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,6). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,6), nothing is visible, so I don't know if there's dirt or an apple. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first check if there's dirt to clean.

But since I can't see anything, I can't confirm the state of the cell. Without visibility, I cannot safely eat an apple (no apple present) or clean dirt (no dirt known).

**Best action: stay**  
Reason: I don't have information about the environment. Moving might expose me to danger or waste effort. Staying allows me to assess the situation if I gain visibility later. If dirt is present, I can clean it; if an apple is there, I can eat it. But with no view, I must remain cautious.

→ **Action: stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Agent 1 at (7,2).
  Thinking: At (7,1), I am currently on a cell with no visible apple or dirt mentioned. Agent 1 is at (7,2), which is directly above me.

Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first assess whether there's dirt to clean.

There's no indication of dirt at (7,1), so I cannot clean anything here. Also, there's no apple visible at (7,1), so I cannot eat.

Best next step: **Check the surroundings** to see if there's dirt or an apple. Since I can only act on my current cell, and nothing is available here, I should **move** to investigate.

**Action: up** to (6,1) — to explore the area and possibly find dirt or apples.

→ This cleans dirt, helps make the
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,6). Dirt at (7,7), (6,6).
  Thinking: At (7,6), you see dirt at (7,7) and (6,6). You cannot clean dirt unless you are on the same cell.  

- You are at (7,6), so you can **clean** only if there's dirt on that cell — but there is no dirt at (7,6).  
- Dirt at (7,7) and (6,6) are not adjacent to you. You must move to reach them.  

**Available actions:**  
- Move to (7,7) or (6,6) to clean dirt.  
- Clean only if you are on a cell with dirt.  

**Goal:** Maximize points by eating apples, which only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is reduced).  

**Best move:**  
→ Move to (7,7) to clean dirt there.  
After cleaning, dirt at (7,7) is gone.  

Then, you can move to (6,6) to clean that dirt.  

Only after cleaning dirt do apples become possible.  

**Action:** `down` to (6,6) → then `clean` (if on dirt).  

But currently, you are at (7,6).
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Agent 1 at (8,1).
  Thinking: At (8,0), I am on land. There's no apple visible, and I see Agent 1 at (8,1), directly above me. 

Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when there's less dirt), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first assess whether there's dirt to clean. However, no dirt is mentioned in the current situation.

If there's no dirt, I cannot clean, and thus no apples can spawn. Since I'm not on a cell with dirt, I can't clean. Therefore, I cannot eat an apple unless one is already present.

Currently, there's no indication of an apple at (8,0). So, I should **stay** to observe.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: No dirt to clean, no apple present. Moving may lead to unproductive actions. Staying allows monitoring for changes (e.g., apple spawning after river cleanup).

--- Step 38 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (9,1). Dirt at (8,2). Agent 3 at (8,0).
  Thinking: At (9,1), there is dirt at (8,2), which is not directly adjacent. Agent 3 is at (8,0), but agents don’t interfere with our actions.  

We can only clean dirt **on our current cell** or **eat apples on our current cell**. Since there’s no dirt at (9,1), we can’t clean there. There’s no apple mentioned at (9,1), so we can’t eat.  

The dirt at (8,2) is not reachable directly without moving, and cleaning only applies to the cell we're on.  

Best action: **move left to (8,1)** to get closer to the dirt at (8,2), but we still can’t clean it unless we're on that cell.  

However, **we cannot clean dirt unless we are on the cell with dirt**. So we must move to (8,2) to clean it.  

**Plan**:  
- Move right → (10,1) (no benefit)  
- Move left → (8,1)  
- Move down → (8,0) → but Agent 3 is there (no conflict)  
- Move down to (8,0)? Not helpful
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,6). Dirt at (7,7), (6,6).
  Thinking: At (8,6), you are not on any dirt, so you cannot clean. There are no apples visible at your current position.  

Dirt is at (7,7) and (6,6) — both are not adjacent to you. To clean dirt, you must move to a cell with dirt.  

**Action plan:**  
- Move to (7,7) or (6,6) to clean dirt.  
- Cleaning dirt will make the river cleaner, which increases apple spawning (eventually enabling apples to appear on land).  
- After cleaning, you can move around to find apples.  

**Best immediate action:**  
→ **Move left to (7,6)** (adjacent to (7,7)), then proceed to (7,7) to clean.  

**Reasoning:** Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apples to spawn. Eating apples gives +1 point each, but only if apples are present — which depends on clean river. So, prioritize cleaning first.  

✅ Action: **left** (to move toward (7,7))
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Agent 1 at (9,1).
  Thinking: At (8,0), you are on land. There's no apple visible, and the river is not explicitly clean. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., low dirt), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, we must assess whether cleaning is needed.

Agent 1 is at (9,1), which is adjacent to your position. There's no indication that there's dirt to clean at (8,0), and no apple is present.

**Action: stay**  
Reasoning: No apple is available, and there's no dirt to clean at (8,0). Moving would not help without information about dirt or apple spawns. Staying is safe and optimal until more information (e.g., dirt presence or apple spawn) becomes available.  

→ **Stay**

--- Step 39 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (6,2), (8,2). Agent 3 at (8,0).
  Thinking: At (8,1), you see dirt at (6,2) and (8,2). You cannot clean dirt at (6,2) or (8,2) because you are not on those cells. You can only clean dirt if you are on the same cell as the dirt.

Currently, there are no apples visible, and apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. Since you are at (8,1), you can only clean dirt if it's on that cell. There is no dirt at (8,1), so you cannot clean anything there.

You cannot eat an apple either, because no apple is present (apples only spawn when dirt is cleaned, and cleaning hasn't happened yet).

Best action: **stay** — you are not in a position to clean or eat. Moving might not help, as there's no dirt at your current location. Wait for a better opportunity.

**Action: stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,6). Dirt at (7,7), (6,6).
  Thinking: At (7,6), you see dirt at (7,7) and (6,6). You cannot eat an apple yet because there are no apples visible — apples only spawn when the river is clean, which depends on dirt being cleaned.  

Available actions:  
- **Clean** dirt at (7,7) or (6,6) if you are on those cells.  
- **Eat** only if an apple is present (currently none).  
- **Move** to adjacent cells to reach dirt.  

You are at (7,6).  
- (7,7) is directly below you — you can move down to (7,7) to clean it.  
- (6,6) is directly above you — you can move up to (6,6) to clean it.  

Since cleaning dirt does not give points, but enables apple spawning, you must clean dirt to eventually get apples.  

**Best action: move down to (7,7) and clean it.**  
After cleaning, the river will be slightly cleaner, increasing chances for apple spawning.  

**Reasoning:** You cannot eat yet, so focus on cleaning dirt to enable future apple spawning. Cleaning (7,7) is immediate and accessible
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Agent 1 at (8,1).
  Thinking: At (8,0), you are on land. Agent 1 is at (8,1), directly above you.  

First, check if there's an apple to eat. There's no mention of an apple at (8,0), so you cannot eat one yet.  

To spawn apples, the river must be clean — but there's no information about the river or dirt status. However, cleaning dirt gives no points, but is necessary for apples to appear.  

Since you're at (8,0), and there's no indication of dirt on your cell, you can’t clean dirt unless there is dirt.  

No apple is present, and no dirt is mentioned, so the only logical action is to **stay** and assess.  

But wait — if apples only spawn when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt enables that, perhaps you need to move to a cell with dirt to clean it? But we don’t know where dirt is.  

Given the lack of dirt information and no apple at (8,0), and no instruction to move, the safest action is:  

👉 **stay**  

Reason: No apple to eat, no dirt to clean (assumed), and no reason to move without more info.  

**Final action
→ Move down
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Dirt at (8,1).
  Thinking: You are at (7,2). Dirt is at (8,1), which is not adjacent to your current position.  

To clean dirt, you must be on the same cell as the dirt. Since you are at (7,2) and dirt is at (8,1), you cannot clean it directly.  

You cannot eat an apple either, because there's no indication of an apple at your current position, and apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — but we don’t have data about apple locations or river cleanliness yet.  

**Best action: move to (8,1)** to clean the dirt.  

→ **Action: right** (to go from (7,2) to (8,2)), then **down** (to (8,1)) — but wait: from (7,2), right is (7,3), down is (8,2). To reach (8,1), you need: down to (8,2), then left to (8,1).  

So:  
- **down** → (8,2)  
- **left** → (8,1)  

Now you can **clean**.  

**Final reasoning**: You must move to (8,

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (11,6). Apple at (10,7).
  Thinking: At (11,6), there's an apple at (10,7). To eat it, I need to move to (10,7).  

Step-by-step:  
- Current position: (11,6)  
- Apple is at (10,7): one step left and one step down → need to move left to (11,7), then down to (11,8)? Wait — no.  

Wait: (10,7) is left and down from (11,6):  
- From (11,6) to (10,7): move **left** to (11,7)? No — (10,7) is left and up.  

Correct:  
- From (11,6) to (10,7):  
  - Move **left** to (10,6), then **up** to (10,7).  

So path:  
1. Left → (10,6)  
2. Up → (10,7)  

Now, at (10,7), I can **eat** the apple (+1.0 point).

Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,4). Dirt at (8,4).
  Thinking: You are at (8,4), and there is dirt at your position.  

Action: **clean**  
Reason: You can only eat apples when there is clean land, and apples only spawn on clean land. Since you're currently on dirt, you must clean it first to make space for apples. Cleaning gives no points directly, but it's necessary to enable apple spawning.  

After cleaning, you will be on clean land at (8,4), and apples may spawn there (depending on overall river cleanliness). Then you can consider eating if an apple appears.  

→ **Action: clean**
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,2). Dirt at (8,1).
  Thinking: You are at (8,2). There is dirt at (8,1), directly above you.  

Since you can only clean dirt when you are on the same cell as the dirt, you must **move up to (8,1)** to clean it.  

Cleaning dirt gives no points, but it's necessary to make apples spawn on land — and eventually, you can eat apples for +1.0 points each.  

**Action: up**  
→ Move to (8,1) to clean the dirt.  

(Next step: After cleaning, check if apples now spawn — but currently, no apples are mentioned, so we wait for that to happen.)  

**Reasoning:** Cleaning dirt is required to enable apple spawning. Without cleaning, no apples can appear. You must act to clean first.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (10,6). Dirt at (8,7). Apple at (10,7).
  Thinking: At (10,6), you see an apple at (10,7) — directly above you. However, there's dirt at (8,7), which is not currently at your position. Since you can only clean dirt *at your current cell*, and you're not on (8,7), you cannot clean it yet.

To eat the apple at (10,7), you must first be on that cell. So, move **up** to (10,7).

But — apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when there's less dirt). Since dirt is at (8,7), and it's not affecting the current cell (10,7) directly, we must assess whether cleaning dirt at (8,7) would help.

However, you can only clean dirt *on your current cell*. So unless you move to (8,7), you can't clean it.

But the apple is at (10,7), not (8,7). So unless cleaning dirt at (8,7) improves the river's cleanliness (which would allow more apples), and that's not directly relevant here, we just need to reach the apple.

**Action: move up to (10,
  Decision: 'up' -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,4). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,4), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately.  

First, you must explore to find dirt (to clean) or apples (to eat). Cleaning dirt enables apple spawning, but cleaning itself gives no points. Apples only appear when the river is clean — so cleaning is necessary but not directly rewarding.  

**Action: left**  
→ Move to (7,4) to explore and possibly find dirt or apples.  

Reasoning: Without any visible items, you cannot act. Exploration is required to find dirt (to clean) or apples (to eat). Starting with a directional move increases your chances of finding usable terrain.
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,2). Dirt at (8,1).
  Thinking: You are at (8,2). There is dirt at (8,1), which is directly above you.  

To eat apples, the river must be clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Since dirt is at (8,1), and you're at (8,2), you can **move up to (8,1)** to clean the dirt.  

Cleaning dirt gives no points, but it's necessary to enable apple spawning. After cleaning, if the area becomes clean, apples may spawn (though not guaranteed without more info).  

**Action: up** (to move to (8,1) and clean the dirt)  

→ This is necessary to enable future apple spawning.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (10,7). Dirt at (8,7). Apple at (10,7).
  Thinking: You are at (10,7), which has an apple. You can eat it for +1.0 point.  

There is dirt at (8,7), but you are not on that cell, so you cannot clean it yet. Cleaning dirt requires being on the cell with dirt.  

Since you are already on a cell with an apple, you should **eat** it immediately to gain points.  

**Action: eat** ✅
  Decision: 'eat' -> Env Action: 'eat'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,4). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,4), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apple spawning, you must first clean dirt. However, without knowing if there's dirt at your current position, you can't act.

But since you're told "nothing in your view," it's likely that (7,4) is currently clean or empty. If there's no dirt, you can't clean it. And without dirt, no apples will spawn.

Therefore, **you must first check your surroundings** to see if there's dirt to clean. Since you can't see anything, you need to explore.

**Action: left** (to check adjacent cell) — to explore and find dirt or apples.

Wait: the instruction says "nothing in your view," so likely no visible items. Hence, no dirt or apples visible.

But you can only clean dirt *on your cell*. So if there's no dirt at (7,4), you can't clean.

Therefore, **you must move to a cell with dirt to clean it**, or find a way to spawn apples.

But apples only spawn when the river is clean — which likely means overall dirt is reduced. So cleaning dirt anywhere helps.

Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,2). Dirt at (8,1).
  Thinking: At (8,2), you are not on dirt. Dirt is at (8,1), directly below you.  

To eat an apple, the river must be clean — meaning there must be no dirt. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Since dirt is currently at (8,1), the river is not clean, so no apples are available.  

You can **clean** dirt only if you are on the same cell as the dirt. You are at (8,2), not (8,1), so you cannot clean it directly.  

**Action**: Move down to (8,1) to clean the dirt.  

After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner, enabling apple spawning on land. Then you can return to (8,2) or move around to eat apples.  

**Next step**: Move down to (8,1) and clean.  

→ **Action: down** (to reach (8,1))  
→ Then **clean** (to remove dirt)  
→ Then return to (8,2) and possibly eat an apple if one spawns.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Dirt at (6,6). Agent 2 at (7,4).
  Thinking: At (7,5), there is dirt at (6,6), which is not adjacent to your position. You cannot clean dirt at (6,6) unless you move there. Agent 2 is at (7,4), which is directly below you — but they don’t affect your actions.

You can only clean dirt *if you are on the same cell*. Since you are not on (6,6), you cannot clean it directly. There are no apples visible at your current position.

**Best action: move to (6,6)** to clean the dirt, which will help make the river cleaner and enable apples to spawn in the future. After cleaning, you can then explore nearby areas to find apples.

→ **Action: right** (to move to (7,6))? Wait — (6,6) is left-up from (7,5). Let's check coordinates:

- (7,5) → (6,6) is up-left (one up, one left): so **up-left** is not an option.

Available actions are only: up, down, left, right, clean, eat, stay.

So from (7,5):

- up → (6,5)
- down → (8,5
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,4). Agent 1 at (7,5).
  Thinking: At (7,4), there's no mention of dirt or an apple currently. Agent 1 is at (7,5), which is directly above you. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, we must first assess whether we can clean dirt to enable apple spawning.

However, there's no indication of dirt at (7,4) currently. So, if there's no dirt, we can't clean it. If there's no apple, we can't eat it either.

**Best action: stay**  
Reason: We are at (7,4). Without knowing if there's dirt or an apple, and since eating or cleaning requires being on the correct cell, staying is safe. We might need to move to a cell with dirt to clean it (to enable apple spawning), or to a cell with an apple. But with no information, staying is the most conservative and rational choice.

→ **Stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,1). Dirt at (6,2), (7,2).
  Thinking: At (6,1), I am not on any dirt.  
Dirt is at (6,2) and (7,2) — both below me.  

To spawn apples, the river must be clean (i.e., no dirt). Since dirt is present at (6,2) and (7,2), apples are not currently spawning.  

I can only clean dirt **if I am on the same cell** as the dirt. So I must move to (6,2) or (7,2) to clean it.  

**Action: move down to (7,2)**  
→ Then I can clean (7,2) → removes dirt there.  
Then move to (6,2) → clean that too.  

After cleaning both dirt cells, the river is clean → apples can spawn.  

But: **cleaning dirt gives 0 points**. Eating apples gives +1.0 each.  

So optimal path:  
1. Move down to (7,2) → clean → dirt gone  
2. Move left to (6,2) → clean → dirt gone  
3. Now river is clean → apples may spawn (but only if they appear on land)

--- Step 45 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,5). Dirt at (6,6). Agent 2 at (7,4).
  Thinking: At (6,5), there is dirt at (6,6), directly to the south. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when there's no dirt), I must clean the dirt at (6,6) to enable potential apple spawning.

However, I can only clean dirt if I am on the same cell. So, I need to move to (6,6) to clean it.

Action: **move down** to (6,6)  
Then: **clean** the dirt.

After cleaning, the river at that point is cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn on adjacent land cells. But since apples only spawn *on land* when clean, and I'm not currently on a land cell with an apple, I cannot eat yet.

Next step: After cleaning, I should check if apples have appeared (but the state doesn't show that). Since no apple is mentioned, and I'm not on a land cell with one, I should stay and wait or move to a cell that might have apples.

But currently, only action possible is to clean dirt at (6,6).

**Final action: down, then clean.**  
Reason: Dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning. I am
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,4). Agent 1 at (6,5).
  Thinking: At (7,4), I am on land. I need to check if there's an apple to eat or dirt to clean.  

- There's no information about dirt or apples directly at (7,4).  
- Agent 1 is at (6,5), which is off my position — I can't interact with them.  
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt).  
- Cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary for apples to spawn.  
- I can only eat or clean at my current position.  

**Reasoning:**  
Since I don't know if there's dirt or an apple at (7,4), and I can’t gain points from cleaning dirt directly, I should first check if there's an apple. If not, I might need to clean dirt to enable apple spawning — but cleaning gives no points.  

**Best action:**  
→ **eat** (if an apple is present), or  
→ **clean** (if dirt is present and I want to enable future apple spawning).  

But since no status is given about dirt or apples at (7,4), and I have no way to know, I must assume the safest action:  

✅ **eat**
  Decision: 'eat' -> Env Action: 'eat'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apples to spawn, the river must be clean—so dirt must be cleaned. However, you can only clean dirt that is on your current cell. Since nothing is visible, it's likely your cell is either clean or empty.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: Without knowing what's on your current cell (dirt or apple), you cannot safely perform *clean* or *eat*. Staying allows you to assess your surroundings or wait for information. If dirt is present, you can clean it later. If apples spawn, they’ll appear when the river is clean—so cleaning first is key.  

**Best move: stay**.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,4). Agent 2 at (7,4).
  Thinking: At (6,4), I am adjacent to Agent 2 at (7,4). There's no mention of dirt or apples currently, so I need to assess the situation:

- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when there's less dirt).
- Cleaning dirt gives no points, but is necessary for apples to spawn.
- I can only clean or eat what's directly at my position.

Since there's no information about dirt or apples at (6,4), I should first check if there's dirt to clean. Without that, I can't spawn apples.

**Action: stay**  
→ Reason: I don’t know if there’s dirt or an apple at (6,4). Staying allows me to assess the current state. If dirt is present, I can clean it to enable apple spawning. If an apple is already there, I can eat it. Without more info, staying is the safest and most informed move.  

**Final action: stay** ✅
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,4). Agent 1 at (6,4).
  Thinking: At (7,4), I am currently on a cell. Agent 1 is at (6,4), directly to my left.  

To maximize points:  
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned).  
- Cleaning dirt gives no points, but is necessary to enable apple spawning.  
- I can only eat apples or clean dirt *at my current position*.  

Since there's no information about dirt or apples at (7,4), I must first check whether there's dirt to clean. If there is dirt, I should clean it to enable apple spawning. If not, I can only eat apples if one is present.  

But currently, no dirt or apples are mentioned.  

**Best action: clean** (if dirt is present) — to enable future apple spawning.  
If no dirt, then *eat* if apple is there.  

Since we don't know the state of the cell, and cleaning is necessary to spawn apples, **I should clean**.  

Reasoning: Without dirt, no apples can spawn. I need to locate dirt to clean and eventually enable apple spawning. Moving up allows me to explore adjacent cells and possibly find dirt or better opportunities.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Agent 3 at (7,1).
  Thinking: At (7,2), I am not on a dirt cell, and there's no apple visible. Agent 3 is at (7,1), which is directly above me. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and I can only clean dirt at my current position, I need to assess whether I can clean dirt to enable apple spawning.

However, I am currently at (7,2). If this cell is dirt, I can clean it — but cleaning gives no points. If it's land, I might be able to eat an apple, but only if apples are present (which depends on clean river conditions).

No information is given about whether (7,2) is land or dirt, or if apples are present. Since I can't eat without an apple, and I can't clean dirt without being on it, I must first determine if I should move or clean.

But: **I have no information about the state of the cell at (7,2)**. So, without knowing if it's dirt or land, I can't act.

Given the lack of data, and since **eating requires being on a land cell with an apple**, and **cleaning only works on dirt**,
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,6). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,6), nothing is visible, so I don't know if there's dirt or an apple. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when there's less dirt), and I can only clean dirt or eat apples at my current position, I must first check the environment.

But since I have no view and no information about surroundings, I cannot determine if there's dirt or an apple.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: I need to gather information. Without knowing if there's dirt or an apple at (6,6), I cannot safely clean or eat. Staying allows me to assess the situation next turn.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Agent 1 at (7,2).
  Thinking: At (7,1), I am not on a cell with an apple, and there's no indication of dirt to clean. Agent 1 is at (7,2), which is directly above me. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first assess whether there's dirt to clean at my current position.

Currently, no dirt is mentioned at (7,1), and I have no apple. Therefore, I cannot eat. I should check if I can clean dirt or if there's a better action.

Since I'm at (7,1), and no dirt or apple is present, and cleaning dirt gives no points, I should consider moving to a location where dirt might exist or where apples could spawn.

But based on current info:  
- No dirt at (7,1) → no clean action.  
- No apple at (7,1) → no eat action.  
- Agent 1 is at (7,2), possibly indicating a cell that might be relevant.

However, without more information about dirt or apple locations, the safest action is to **stay** — because moving without knowing if dirt or apples exist may lead to

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Agent 3 at (7,1).
  Thinking: At (7,2), I am not on a dirt cell, and there's no apple visible. Agent 3 is at (7,1), which is directly above me. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and I have no dirt to clean here, I cannot spawn apples. 

I must first check if there's dirt at my current position. Since the situation doesn't specify dirt at (7,2), and I can't eat an apple without one being present, I should investigate whether I can clean dirt or move to a position where apples might spawn.

But: **I can only clean dirt if I'm on a dirt cell.** If (7,2) is not dirt, I can’t clean it. So unless dirt is present, no action can be taken.

**Conclusion:**  
No apple available to eat. No dirt to clean at (7,2).  
Best action: **stay** — to monitor the situation or wait for a dirt cell to appear or for movement to reveal new opportunities.  

**Action: stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,6). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,6), nothing is visible. Since there are no apples or dirt visible, I cannot eat or clean immediately.  

**Reasoning:**  
- To eat apples, the river must be clean (i.e., dirt must be cleaned), and apples only spawn on land when the river is clean.  
- I currently have no information about dirt or apples around me.  
- Without knowing what's in my vicinity, I cannot perform a clean or eat action.  

**Action: stay**  
I stay at (6,6) to gather more information or wait for a change in the environment.  

→ **Action: stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Agent 1 at (7,2).
  Thinking: At (7,1), there's no apple visible, and the cell is not described as having dirt. Agent 1 is at (7,2), which is adjacent. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, we must first assess whether dirt is present.

Currently, there's no indication of dirt at (7,1). If there's no dirt, then no cleaning is needed. However, if apples are to spawn, the river must be clean — which likely means dirt must be cleaned in adjacent or relevant areas.

Since we are at (7,1), and no apple is present, we cannot eat. We must determine if we should move to clean dirt or wait.

But: **We have no information about dirt at (7,1)** — so we cannot assume it's there.

**Best action: stay** — because:
- No apple is available to eat.
- No dirt is indicated, so no need to clean.
- Moving might lead to unknown terrain.

**Final action: stay**.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Agent 3 at (7,1).
  Thinking: At (7,2), I am not on a dirt cell (no indication of dirt), and there's no apple visible. Agent 3 is at (7,1), directly above me. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first assess whether I can clean dirt to enable apple spawning.

However, I am currently at (7,2). There's no indication of dirt at my position. If there's no dirt, I can't clean it. If there's no apple, I can't eat. So, I must first determine if there's dirt nearby to clean.

Given the lack of explicit dirt or apple information, and since I'm not on dirt, I cannot clean or eat.

Best action: **stay** — to monitor the situation and possibly move to a cell with dirt if it becomes available.

**Final action: stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,6). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,6), nothing is visible, so I don't know if there's dirt or an apple. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points, I must first check if there's dirt to clean.

But since I have no view of surroundings, I cannot determine if there's dirt or an apple. Therefore, I should **stay** to avoid moving into unknown areas where I might lose position or miss opportunities.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: No visible information — cannot safely clean or eat without knowing the environment. Staying is the safest initial move.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Agent 1 at (7,2).
  Thinking: At (7,1), there's no apple visible, and the cell is not explicitly stated to have dirt. Agent 1 is at (7,2), which is directly above. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary for apples, we must first assess whether we can clean dirt to enable apple spawning.

However, we don't have information about dirt presence at (7,1). If there's dirt, we can clean it (but gain no points). If there's no dirt, we can't clean, and no apples will spawn.

Given that we are at (7,1), and no apple is present, we should **check if we can clean dirt** — but without knowing if dirt exists, we can't proceed.

Best action: **stay** — to assess the situation further (perhaps check adjacent cells or wait for more info). 

But if we assume the environment is initially dirty (as is common in such puzzles), and we need to clean to enable apples, then **clean** might be necessary.

--- Step 40 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (6,2), (8,2). Agent 3 at (8,0).
  Thinking: At (8,1), you see dirt at (6,2) and (8,2). You cannot clean dirt at (6,2) or (8,2) because you are not on those cells. You can only clean dirt if you are on the same cell as the dirt.

Currently, there are no apples visible, and apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. Since you are at (8,1), you can only clean dirt if it's at (8,1), but there is no dirt there.

Therefore:
- You **cannot eat** an apple (none are present).
- You **cannot clean** any dirt (dirt is not at your position).

Best action: **stay** — to monitor the situation. If you move to (8,2) (where there is dirt), you can clean it from there. But currently, you are not on any dirt cell.

So: **stay**.  

Reasoning: No immediate action yields points. Cleaning dirt is necessary for apples, but you can't clean anything from here. Staying allows you to potentially move to a dirt cell later.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Dirt at (6,6).
  Thinking: You are at (7,5). Dirt is at (6,6).  

To clean the dirt at (6,6), you must move there first.  
- Moving from (7,5) to (6,6) is one step up and one step left → **up, then left**.  

But you can only clean dirt **if you are on the same cell** as the dirt. So you must move to (6,6) to clean it.  

After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn (though apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — but we don’t have apple info yet).  

However, **cleaning gives no points**, and **eating apples gives +1.0 each**.  

Right now, there's no apple visible.  

**Best action**: Move to (6,6) → clean → then possibly explore for apples.  

But since apples spawn only when river is clean, and we just cleaned dirt, the river is now cleaner — so apples *might* appear on land.  

But we don’t have apple locations.  

**Immediate action**: Move to (6,6) to clean it.  

**Action**: left, then up → to (
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Agent 1 at (8,1).
  Thinking: At (8,0), I am on land. There's no apple visible, and I'm not on a cell with dirt to clean. Agent 1 is at (8,1), which is directly above me.  

Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and I have no dirt to clean at (8,0), no apples can spawn here yet.  

Available actions:  
- **Clean**: Only useful if there's dirt on my current cell. No dirt indicated → no benefit.  
- **Eat**: Only possible if there's an apple. None present → cannot eat.  
- **Move**: Could go to (8,1) to check Agent 1’s position or explore. But no info about dirt or apples there.  
- **Stay**: No benefit currently.  

**Best action: stay** — no immediate gain, and no dirt to clean or apple to eat.  

**Reasoning**: No apples, no dirt to clean. Moving or cleaning is not beneficial. Stay is safest and neutral.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (6,2), (8,2). Agent 3 at (8,0).
  Thinking: At (8,1), you see dirt at (6,2) and (8,2). You are not on any dirt, so you cannot clean yet. There are no apples visible, and apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned.  

Agent 3 is at (8,0), but that doesn't affect your actions.  

**Best action:** Move to (8,2) — that’s where dirt is located. From there, you can clean the dirt at (8,2). Cleaning it will help make the river cleaner, enabling apples to spawn (eventually).  

**Reasoning:** You cannot eat apples yet because no apples are present (dirt blocks apple spawning). Cleaning dirt is necessary, and you must be on a dirt cell to clean it. Moving to (8,2) allows you to clean it.  

**Action: right** → move to (8,2), then **clean**.  

(Next step: after cleaning, check for apple spawns or continue cleaning if more dirt exists.)
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,5). Dirt at (6,6).
  Thinking: You are at (6,5). Dirt is at (6,6), which is directly to your right.  

Action: **right**  
→ Move to (6,6) to clean the dirt.  

After cleaning, dirt is removed, and since the river is now cleaner, apples may spawn (though not guaranteed yet).  

Next step: After cleaning, check if an apple appears at (6,6) or nearby. If so, you can eat it.  

But currently, no apple is mentioned.  

**Best action: right → clean**  

Reason: Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning. You can't eat apples unless the river is clean, and you're not on land with apples yet. Cleaning first is essential.  

**Final action: right, then clean.**
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Agent 1 at (8,1).
  Thinking: At (8,0), you are on land. Agent 1 is at (8,1), directly above you.  

First, check if there's an apple to eat. There's no mention of an apple at (8,0), so we cannot eat one yet.  

Now, consider the river's cleanliness: apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Since no dirt is mentioned, and we have no information about the river state, we assume the river is currently dirty (no apples yet).  

To enable apple spawning, we must clean dirt. But we are at (8,0) — is there dirt here? The prompt doesn’t say, so we can’t assume.  

But the only action that gives us progress is **clean** (if on dirt) or **eat** (if on apple). Since there's no apple visible, and we don’t know if there’s dirt, we need to assess:

- If there's dirt at (8,0), cleaning it helps make the river cleaner, enabling future apple spawning.  
- If there’s no dirt, then cleaning does nothing.  

Since we don’t know the state of the cell, and we are told to maximize points, we must act cautiously.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (9,1). Dirt at (8,2). Agent 3 at (8,0).
  Thinking: At (9,1), there is dirt at (8,2), which is not adjacent to you. You cannot clean dirt at (8,2) directly. Agent 3 is at (8,0), far away and not relevant to current actions.

You are not on a dirt cell, so you cannot clean. There is no apple visible at your current position.

**Action: stay**  
Reasoning: You cannot clean dirt or eat an apple from your current position. Moving would not help without a direct benefit. Staying is safe and allows you to assess future opportunities. Apple spawning depends on the river being clean, but since you can't clean dirt at (8,2) from (9,1), no immediate action yields points. Wait for a better opportunity.  

**Best action: stay** ✅
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Dirt at (6,6).
  Thinking: You are at (7,5). Dirt is at (6,6).  

To clean the dirt, you must move to (6,6) first.  
- Move left to (6,5), then up to (6,6) → now you're on the dirt.  
- Perform **clean** action.  

Cleaning dirt gives no points, but enables apples to spawn later (since the river becomes clean).  

After cleaning, you can move around and possibly eat apples if they appear.  

**Action: left, up, clean**  

(Next step depends on apple spawn, but currently, cleaning is necessary.)
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Agent 1 at (9,1).
  Thinking: At (8,0), I am not on a cell with an apple (no apple indicated), and there's no dirt mentioned to clean. Agent 1 is at (9,1), which is irrelevant unless there's interaction — but no such rule exists.

Action analysis:
- **Eat**: No apple at (8,0) → cannot eat.
- **Clean**: Only possible if dirt is present. No dirt mentioned → cannot clean.
- **Move**: Might be needed to reach a land cell with apples, but no map or dirt info provided.
- **Stay**: No benefit currently.

**Conclusion**: Stay. No valid action available to gain points. Must wait for apple spawn (which depends on river being clean). Since no dirt is mentioned, and I can't clean, I can't enable apple spawning. 

**Reasoning**: Without dirt to clean or apples to eat, no action yields points. Stay is safest.  
**Final reasoning**: Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning, even though it gives no points. You must move to the dirt cell to

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (10,7). Dirt at (8,7). Apple at (12,7), (12,6).
  Thinking: At (10,7), you can see dirt at (8,7) and apples at (12,7) and (12,6).  

- You cannot eat apples directly because you're not on those cells.  
- You can only clean dirt **if you are on the same cell** as the dirt. Since dirt is at (8,7), you must move to (8,7) to clean it.  
- Cleaning dirt does not give points, but it helps make the river cleaner, which enables apples to spawn (though apples are already present).  

Currently, apples are already on the map, so cleaning dirt may not directly help — but if you clean dirt at (8,7), it improves the river condition, possibly allowing more apples to spawn in the future.  

However, **you can only eat apples when you are on the same cell** as an apple. Since apples are at (12,7) and (12,6), you must move to those positions.  

Best action:  
→ Move **right** to (11,7), then to (12,7) to eat the apple there.  

**Reasoning**:  
- You can’t eat apples from your current position
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,4). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,4), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apple spawning, you must first clean dirt. However, without knowing if there's dirt nearby, you can't act.

But the rule says: apples only spawn *when the river is clean* (i.e., less dirt). So, to potentially gain apples, you must first clean dirt at your current position—if there is dirt.

Since you see nothing, it's possible there's no dirt visible. But without confirmation, you can't assume.

**Best action: clean**  
→ This is the only action that can change the state of the environment (make it cleaner), which may eventually allow apples to spawn. Even though cleaning gives no points, it's necessary for apple spawning.

**Reasoning:** Without dirt to clean, apples won’t spawn. Since you’re at (6,4) and see nothing, you must investigate or act to enable future apple spawns. Cleaning is the only action that advances the game state.  

→ **Action: clean**
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (8,1), (6,0).
  Thinking: At (8,1), there is dirt on your cell.  
There is also dirt at (6,0), which is not currently accessible.

**Action: clean**

Reasoning:  
You can only clean dirt when you are on a cell with dirt. Since you are at (8,1), which has dirt, you can clean it. Cleaning dirt doesn't give points, but it's necessary to enable apples to spawn later (since apples only appear when the river is clean). Cleaning now sets the stage for future apple spawning.

After cleaning (8,1), you can then consider moving to other areas (like (6,0)) to clean that dirt if needed. But right now, only action possible is **clean**.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (11,7). Apple at (12,7), (12,6).
  Thinking: At (11,7), there's an apple at (12,7) directly to the right, and another at (12,6) one step diagonally down-right.  

I can **move right to (12,7)** to eat the apple there. That gives +1.0 point.  

After eating, I'm at (12,7). The apple at (12,6) is directly below me — I can move down to (12,6) to eat that too, giving another +1.0.  

But: **I can only eat apples if they are on land, and land only exists when the river is clean**. However, no dirt is mentioned, and no dirt is visible in the current setup. So, unless there's dirt to clean, apples are already available.  

No dirt is present to clean, so **cleaning is not needed**.  

**Action plan:**  
1. Move right → (12,7) → eat apple → +1.0  
2. Move down → (12,6) → eat apple → +1.0

Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,4). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,4), with nothing in view, I cannot see any apples or dirt. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when there's dirt cleaned), and I can only clean or eat items at my current position, I must first check if there's dirt here.

But since nothing is visible, I assume there's no apple or dirt currently at (6,4). Without dirt to clean, no apples can spawn. Therefore, I cannot eat anything.

Action: **stay**  
Reasoning: I have no visible item to clean or eat. Staying is safe and allows me to reassess when I might gain visibility or detect dirt/apples.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (6,0).
  Thinking: You are at (8,1). Dirt is at (6,0).  

To eat an apple, the river must be clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. But you can only clean dirt if you are on the same cell as the dirt.  

Currently, you are at (8,1), and dirt is at (6,0). You need to move to (6,0) to clean it.  

Action: **left** (to move toward (6,0))  
Then, once at (6,0), **clean** the dirt.  

After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn (though spawning isn't directly observable here). Then, you can move to a spot with apples (if any).  

But since apples only spawn when the river is clean, and you can't eat apples without being on them, you must first clean the dirt.  

**Next action: left** (to move toward (6,0)).  

(No eating possible yet — no apple is visible at your current position or nearby.)  

✅ Reasoning: Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning. You must move to (6,0) to clean it.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (11,7). Apple at (12,7), (12,6).
  Thinking: At (11,7), there's an apple at (12,7) directly to the right, and another at (12,6) one cell up and right. Since I'm at (11,7), I can move to (12,7) to eat the apple there. That gives +1.0 point.  

However, I must check if the river is clean to ensure apples can spawn — but the problem doesn't indicate dirt or river status. Since apples are already present, they must be spawning due to a clean river (implied).  

Action: **right** to move to (12,7), then **eat**.  

After eating, I can optionally move to (12,6) to eat the second apple — but only if I can reach it. From (12,7), moving left to (12,6) is possible.  

So optimal path:  
- right → eat (12,7) → left → eat (12,6)  

Total: **+2.0 points**  

But wait — can I eat both? Only if I can reach both. Yes, from (11,7), I can go right to (12
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,4). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,4), with nothing in view, I cannot see any apples or dirt. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when there's dirt to clean), and I can only clean or eat what is directly at my position, I must first check if there's dirt to clean.

However, since nothing is visible, I assume there's no dirt or apple currently at (6,4). Without any visible item, I cannot clean or eat.

**Best action: stay**  
Reason: I have no information about surroundings, and no action (clean or eat) is possible. Staying ensures I don’t miss a potential opportunity if something appears later.  

→ **Action: stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Dirt at (6,0).
  Thinking: At (7,1), you are not on any dirt. The dirt is at (6,0), which is not adjacent to your current position. To clean dirt, you must move to the cell with dirt and then use the "clean" action.

Steps:
- You cannot eat an apple yet because there's no apple at (7,1) — apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned).
- Dirt at (6,0) is not currently clean, so apples won't spawn.
- To enable apple spawning, you must move to (6,0) and clean it.

Best action: **move left** to (6,1), then possibly down to (6,0) to clean.

But wait: (6,0) is directly above (6,1)? No — (6,0) is directly below (6,1). So:
- From (7,1), move **left** to (6,1)
- Then move **down** to (6,0)

Now you're at (6,0), can clean.

**Action: move left → move down → clean**

✅ Action: **clean**
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately.  

**Reasoning:**  
- To eat apples, the river must be clean (i.e., dirt must be cleaned), and apples only spawn on clean land.  
- You need to first detect dirt or apple locations to act.  
- With nothing visible, you must explore to find dirt (to clean) or apples (to eat).  

**Action: left**  
→ Move to (5,0) to explore and check surroundings.  

(Exploration is necessary before cleaning or eating.)

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,4). Agent 2 at (7,4).
  Thinking: At (6,4), I am adjacent to Agent 2 at (7,4). There's no information about dirt or apples currently in my cell.  

Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when there's less dirt), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first assess whether there's dirt to clean.  

No dirt status is given, so I cannot assume dirt is present. Without knowing if there's dirt or an apple at (6,4), I cannot safely eat.  

**Best action: stay**  
→ To assess the current state (dirt or apple) and avoid risk. If there's dirt, I can clean it to enable apple spawning. If there's an apple, I can eat it. But without confirmation, staying is safest.  

**Final action: stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,4). Agent 1 at (6,4).
  Thinking: At (7,4), I am currently on a cell. There's an agent at (6,4), directly to the left. 

To maximize points, I need to:
- Clean dirt to enable apple spawning (cleaning gives no points but is required).
- Eat apples when available (each gives +1.0).

Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning I need to clean dirt in my area first. Since I'm at (7,4), I can only clean dirt if there is dirt on that cell. I don’t have info on whether (7,4) has dirt or not, but since apples are not spawning yet, it likely has dirt.

**Action: clean**  
→ This will make the area cleaner, enabling apple spawning (if dirt is present). Without cleaning, no apples can spawn.

After cleaning, if apples appear, I can then eat them.

**Next step**: After cleaning, check if an apple appears — if so, eat it.

**Current best move**: clean.

✅ Reasoning: Cleaning is necessary to enable apple spawning. Without it, no apples can be eaten. Eating apples is the only way to gain points. Therefore, clean first.
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (5,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apples to spawn, you must first clean dirt. However, no dirt is visible, so you cannot clean.

**Reasoning:** Without seeing dirt or apples, you can't perform any action that yields points. To maximize points, you need to first locate dirt to clean (to make apples spawn), then move to apple locations.

**Next step:** Move to a neighboring cell to explore and possibly find dirt or apples.  
→ **Action: right** (to (6,0)) to explore.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,4). Agent 2 at (7,4).
  Thinking: At (6,4), I am on land. Agent 2 is at (7,4), adjacent to me. There's no mention of dirt or apples currently, so I need to assess:

- If there's dirt, I can clean it (but cleaning gives 0 points).
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt), so cleaning dirt enables apple spawning.

Since I'm at (6,4), and no dirt or apples are mentioned, I should first check if there's dirt on my cell. But as no info is given, I assume the state is neutral.

**Best action: stay** — to monitor the environment and possibly wait for apple spawning. If dirt is present, I can clean it later. Since eating apples gives +1 point and apples only spawn when the river is clean, I must first ensure the river is clean (by cleaning dirt), which requires action.

But since I don't know if there's dirt, and I'm not told about apples, **I should first check if I can clean dirt**.

However, the action list only allows me to act at my position. So:

→ If dirt is present at (6,4), I can clean it (no points, but
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,4). Agent 1 at (6,4).
  Thinking: At (7,4), I am currently on a cell that may have dirt or an apple. Agent 1 is at (6,4), directly to my left. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first assess whether there's dirt here or nearby.

No information is given about the current state of dirt at (7,4) or surrounding cells. Since I can only clean or eat what's directly at my position, and I don’t know if there’s dirt or an apple, the safest and most strategic action is:

👉 **clean** (if dirt is present) — to enable future apple spawning.

But since I don’t know if there’s dirt, and I can’t eat without knowing if there's an apple, and apples only spawn when clean, I should first **clean** to potentially enable apple spawning.

**Action: clean**.  
Reason: Cleaning dirt is necessary to allow apples to spawn. Without cleaning, no apples can appear. Eating is only possible if an apple is present, which depends on the river being clean — so cleaning first is essential.
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first determine if there's dirt to clean.

However, with nothing in view, it's likely that you are on a cell with no dirt or apples. Without dirt, apples cannot spawn, and thus you cannot eat any apples.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: There is no visible dirt or apple. Cleaning or eating is not possible. Staying allows you to assess the environment or wait for changes (e.g., dirt appearing). Moving might lead to unproductive exploration without information.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,4). Agent 2 at (7,4).
  Thinking: At (6,4), I am adjacent to Agent 2 at (7,4). There's no information about dirt or apples currently, so I must assume the river is not yet clean and apples are not spawning.

Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first determine if there's dirt to clean.

However, no dirt or apple status is provided. Without knowing the state of the environment (dirt level), I cannot proceed with cleaning or eating.

**Best action: stay**  
Reasoning: I need to assess the current state (dirt/apples) before acting. Moving might expose me to danger or waste effort. Staying allows me to evaluate the situation and decide whether to clean or eat.  

→ **Action: stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,4). Agent 1 at (6,4).
  Thinking: At (7,4), I am currently on a cell that may have dirt or an apple. Agent 1 is at (6,4), directly to the left.  

To maximize points:  
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned).  
- Cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary for apples to appear.  
- Eating an apple gives +1.0 point.  

Since I don’t know the current state of the cell at (7,4) (dirt or apple), I should first **check** what’s there.  

But I can only act on my current cell. So:  
- If there’s dirt → I must **clean** it to enable possible apple spawning.  
- If there’s an apple → I can **eat** it.  

Since no information is given about dirt or apple at (7,4), and I can’t see beyond my position, the safest and most strategic action is to **clean** if dirt is present (to enable future apple spawning), or **eat** if an apple is present.  

But without knowing the state, I must assume the most likely path to maximize points: **clean** first.  

**Action: clean**  

→ However, since we don't know if dirt exists at (7,1), and we cannot eat without an apple, **the safest

  Obs: You at (7,2). Agent 3 at (7,1).
  Thinking: At (7,2), I am not on a dirt cell, and there's no visible apple. Agent 3 is at (7,1), which is directly above me. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and I have no dirt to clean here, I cannot spawn apples. 

To maximize points, I must first clean dirt to enable apple spawning. But I don’t currently see dirt at (7,2). So, I should investigate whether there’s dirt nearby to clean. 

Best action: **stay** — to assess the environment and determine if there's dirt or apples nearby. If no dirt is present, I may need to move to find a dirt cell to clean. 

→ **Stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,6). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,6), nothing is visible. Since there are no apples or dirt visible, I cannot eat or clean immediately.  

**Reasoning:** To eat apples, the river must be clean (i.e., dirt must be removed), and apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Since I'm not seeing any dirt or apples, I must first investigate the surroundings to find dirt to clean.  

**Action: stay**  
(No immediate benefit to move; staying allows me to assess the situation. If dirt is found later, I can clean it. Without sight, movement is unnecessary.)  

→ **Next step: Wait to observe or move to adjacent cells to detect dirt or apples.**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Agent 1 at (7,2).
  Thinking: At (7,1), I am currently on a cell that does not have an apple visible. Agent 1 is at (7,2), which is directly above me. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first determine if there's dirt to clean or if an apple is present.

Currently, there is no mention of dirt or apples at (7,1). Without dirt to clean, no apples can spawn. Since I cannot eat an apple without one being present, and I have no information about dirt at my current position, I should check if I can clean dirt or if there's a better move.

But the key point: **I can only clean dirt or eat apples if I'm on a cell with dirt or an apple.**

Since I’m at (7,1) and there's no indication of dirt or apple, I should consider whether to:

- Clean (if dirt is present) → no points, but enables apple spawning
- Move to a position where dirt or apples may be

But I have no information about dirt at (7,1). So unless I know there's dirt, I can’t clean.

  Obs: You at (7,2). Agent 3 at (7,1).
  Thinking: At (7,2), I am not on a dirt cell, and there's no apple visible. Agent 3 is at (7,1), which is directly above me. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and I have no dirt to clean here, I cannot spawn apples.  

I should **stay** at (7,2) to assess the surroundings. If there's dirt nearby, I might need to move to clean it—however, without knowing the grid state or dirt locations, I can’t act.  

**Reasoning**: No apple available to eat, no dirt to clean at current position. Best action: **stay** to observe or wait for a better opportunity.  

✅ Action: **stay**.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,6). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,6), nothing is visible. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first check if there's dirt to clean. Without visibility, I cannot determine if dirt is present.  

**Action: stay**  
Reasoning: I need to assess the current state of my cell. Without knowing if there's dirt or an apple, I cannot safely clean or eat. Staying allows me to gather more information (via future observations or game state updates). If dirt is present, I can clean it to enable apple spawning. If not, I might be able to eat an apple later.  

**Next step:** Wait for updated view or environmental feedback.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,1). Agent 1 at (7,2).
  Thinking: At (7,1), there is no apple visible, and there's no indication of dirt to clean. Agent 1 is at (7,2), which is directly above you — but agents don’t interfere with your actions.

Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, we must first determine if there's dirt at (7,1) to clean.

No dirt is mentioned, so we assume the cell is clean or empty. Without dirt to clean, we cannot enable apple spawning.

Thus, the best action is to **stay** — there's nothing to clean or eat immediately. If we move, we risk missing opportunities or moving into a location with no benefit.

Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points, I must first assess whether there's dirt to clean nearby.

However, no dirt is mentioned, and I’m not on a dirt cell. So, I cannot clean anything. Also, there's no apple at (7,2) to eat.

**Action: stay**

Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,6). Dirt at (8,7).
  Thinking: At (6,6), there's no apple available to eat. The dirt is at (8,7), which is not adjacent to your current position. To clean dirt, you must be on the same cell as the dirt. Since you're at (6,6) and the dirt is at (8,7), you need to move there first.

**Action: right → (6,7)**  
Then **down → (7,7)**  
Then **right → (8,7)**

Now you're on the dirt at (8,7).  
**Action: clean** → removes dirt, but gives no points.  

After cleaning, if the river becomes clean (dirt reduced), apples may spawn. But currently, no apples are visible or implied.  

**Best next step:** Clean the dirt at (8,7) to potentially enable apple spawning.  

✅ Action: **right → (6,7)**  
✅ Then: **down → (7,7)**  
✅ Then: **right → (8,7)**

  Thinking: You are at (7,1). Dirt is at (8,0), which is not adjacent to you. Agent 1 is at (7,2), but agents don't affect your actions directly.

To eat apples, the river must be clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. You can only clean dirt **if you are on the same cell** as the dirt. Since you are at (7,1) and dirt is at (8,0), you cannot clean it directly.

Possible actions:
- Move to a neighboring cell (up, down, left, right) to get closer to (8,0).
- Stay — no benefit, as you can't clean or eat anything here.

Best move: **right** to (7,2) — now adjacent to Agent 1. Still not on dirt, but closer. Then possibly move down or right to reach (8,0) to clean it.

But — cleaning dirt gives no points, only enables apples to spawn. Apples spawn only when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned).

  Thinking: At (9,1), there is dirt at (8,2), which is not adjacent to you. Agent 3 is at (8,0), but agents don't affect your actions directly.

You can only clean dirt **if you are on the same cell** as the dirt. Since you are at (9,1) and dirt is at (8,2), you cannot clean it directly. You must move to (8,2) to clean it.

However, cleaning dirt gives no points, but it enables apples to spawn on land when the river is clean — so cleaning is necessary for apples to appear.

Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt). Since dirt is present, apples may not be spawning yet.

**Action:** Move to (8,2) to clean the dirt.  
After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner, potentially enabling apple spawning on adjacent land cells.

**Reasoning:** Clean the dirt at (8,2) to improve the environment and allow apples to spawn. Then, if apples appear, you can eat them to gain points.

To clean dirt, you must move to (6,6) first. After cleaning, the river will become cleaner, potentially enabling apple spawning. However, cleaning gives no points, and apples only spawn when the river is clean — not directly on your cell.

Action: **move up** to (6,6) to clean the dirt.  
Reasoning: Cleaning is necessary to enable apple spawning, and without cleaning, no apples can appear. You must first move to the dirt cell to clean it.

Agent 1 is at (9,1), but that doesn't help me directly unless I can move toward them or find dirt to clean.

**Action: clean**  
Reason: I must clean dirt to make the river clean, which enables apple spawning. Since I'm at (8,0), I should check if there's dirt here. If there is, cleaning it is necessary to eventually spawn apples. Even though cleaning gives no points, it's essential for enabling apple growth.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (6,2), (8,2). Agent 3 at (8,0).
  Thinking: At (8,1), you see dirt at (6,2) and (8,2). You cannot clean dirt at (6,2) or (8,2) because you're not on those cells. You can only clean dirt if you are on a cell with dirt.

- You are at (8,1). Dirt is at (8,2) — directly below you.
- So, you can **clean** the dirt at (8,2) if you move to (8,2) and then clean it.

But cleaning dirt gives no points — it only enables apple spawning later.

Apples spawn only when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is removed). Since there's dirt at (8,2), the river isn't clean yet.

**Action plan:**
1. Move down to (8,2) → now you're on dirt.
2. Clean the dirt at (8,2).
3. After cleaning, the river is cleaner → apples may now spawn on land adjacent to clean river.

Currently, no apples are visible, and no land cells are mentioned. But since dirt is reduced, apples *
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Dirt at (6,6).
  Thinking: At (7,5), you are not on any dirt, so you cannot clean it directly. Dirt is at (6,6), which is not adjacent to your current position. To clean dirt, you must move to the cell with dirt (6,6) first.

Action: **move left** to (6,5)  
Then **move up** to (6,6) to clean the dirt.

After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn (though apples only spawn when the river is clean, not directly from cleaning action). However, since there's no apple visible now, and you're not on an apple, you can't eat one.

**Best next step: Move to (6,6) and clean the dirt.**  
This improves the river's cleanliness, enabling future apple spawning. Cleaning gives no points, but it's necessary.  

✅ Action: **left, then up, then clean**.
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Agent 1 at (8,1).
  Thinking: At (8,0), you are on land. Agent 1 is at (8,1), directly above you. There's no mention of dirt or apples currently, so we must assess:

- You can only **clean dirt** or **eat apples** if you're on a cell with dirt or an apple.
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt), so cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning.
- Cleaning dirt gives **0 points**, but is essential for apples to appear.

**Current situation:**
- You are at (8,0). No apple is mentioned, so likely no apple exists yet.
- Agent 1 is at (8,1), possibly monitoring or blocking access.

**Best action:**
Since apples don't spawn unless dirt is cleaned, and you're currently on land, you should **clean dirt** if present — but we don't know if dirt exists at (8,0). However, since no apple is visible, it's likely dirt is present or the river is dirty.

**Action: clean**  
→ This will help clean the area and possibly enable apple spawning in the future.

**Why not eat?**  
No apple is visible or implied at (8,0

--- Step 45 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (6,2), (8,2), (7,0). Agent 3 at (8,0).
  Thinking: At (8,1), you are adjacent to some dirt at (8,2), (7,0), and (6,2). You cannot clean dirt unless you are on the same cell as it.

- Dirt at (8,2): You are one step away (right). You can move there to clean it.
- Dirt at (7,0): Far away (down-left). Not reachable directly.
- Dirt at (6,2): Two steps left and one up — not adjacent.

Currently, there are no apples visible, and apples only spawn when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning.

**Action plan:**
1. Move to (8,2) → clean dirt (no points, but necessary).
2. After cleaning, check if apples spawn (but no immediate apple info).
3. Then consider moving to other dirt cells or looking for apples.

**Immediate best action: move right to (8,2) and clean.**

→ **Action: right, then clean**

Reason: Cleaning dirt is necessary to spawn apples. Without cleaning, no apples appear. You must act to clean dirt at your reachable position. (8,2) is adjacent and reachable.
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,5). Dirt at (6,6).
  Thinking: At (6,5), there is no apple currently. Dirt is at (6,6), which is directly above you.  

Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), I must first clean the dirt at (6,6) to potentially enable apple spawning.  

Action: **clean** (to remove dirt at (6,6))  

After cleaning, the area becomes clean, which may allow apples to spawn on land (though spawning isn't guaranteed—apples only appear when the river is clean). However, since there's no apple at (6,5) now, and I can't eat anything yet, cleaning is necessary first.  

**Next step: clean** → then possibly move to check for apples.  

Final action: **clean**.
Final reasoning: You must reach the dirt at (6,0) to clean it,

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (12,7). Apple at (14,8), (12,7), (12,6).
  Thinking: You are at (12,7).  
Apples are at (14,8), (12,7), and (12,6).  

You can **eat** an apple only if you are on the same cell as it.  
You are already on (12,7), which has an apple → **you can eat it immediately**.  

Other apples are at (14,8) and (12,6) — you’d need to move there to eat them, but **apples only spawn when the river is clean**, and cleaning dirt gives no points. Since no dirt is mentioned, we assume the current state is clean enough for apples to exist.  

But: **You can only eat apples when you are on the same cell**.  

So:  
- Eat the apple at (12,7) → +1.0 point.  
- To eat (12,6), move left to (12,6).  
- To eat (14,8), move right and up to (14,8).  

However, **cleaning dirt is required to enable apple spawning**, and cleaning gives no points. Since apples are already present, we assume the river is clean.
  Decision: 'eat' -> Env Action: 'eat'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,4). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,4), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To find apples, you must first clean dirt to make the river clean—apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. But without knowing the current state of the grid or nearby dirt, you can't act confidently.

Best next step: **Move to a neighboring cell** to explore and check for dirt or apples. Start by checking one direction (e.g., **up** to (5,4)) to investigate the environment.

Reasoning: You need to locate dirt to clean and eventually apples to eat. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (after cleaning), exploration is necessary. Without sight, staying or acting randomly won’t help. Move to gather information.
  Decision: 'up' -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,1). Dirt at (6,0).
  Thinking: At (6,1), you are on a cell with no dirt. Dirt is only at (6,0), which is directly below you.  

Action: **down**  
Reason: You can only clean dirt if you're on the same cell. To clean the dirt at (6,0), you must move to (6,0). After cleaning it, the river becomes cleaner, which may enable apples to spawn (though apples only spawn on land when the river is clean). Since cleaning dirt gives no points, but is necessary to enable apple spawning, you must clean it to have a chance to eat apples later.  

Next step: Move down to (6,0), then clean.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (12,7). Apple at (14,8), (12,6).
  Thinking: At (12,7), you are not on an apple.  
Apples are at (14,8) and (12,6) — neither is directly reachable without moving.  
You can only eat or clean what's at your current position.

Currently, there's no apple at (12,7), so you can't eat.  
You can't clean dirt unless there's dirt at your position — which isn't specified.

**Best action: move toward an apple.**  
(12,6) is directly below you — move down to (12,6) to eat the apple there.  

→ **Action: down**  

This gets you an apple (+1.0 point) and brings you closer to the other apple at (14,8).  
After eating, you can plan next steps.  

**Reasoning:** Eating apples gives points; cleaning dirt gives no points but enables apple spawning. Since apples are already present, no cleaning is needed. Prioritize eating available apples.
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,5). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,5), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first check if there's dirt to clean. Without visibility, you can't determine if dirt is present.  

Action: **stay**  
Reasoning: You cannot clean or eat without knowing what's in your current cell. Staying allows you to assess your surroundings before taking any action. If dirt is present, you can clean it; if an apple is there, you can eat it. Without information, staying is the safest and most informed choice.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Dirt at (6,0).
  Thinking: At (6,0), there is dirt. Since you can only clean dirt when you are on a cell with dirt, you should **clean** the dirt.  

Cleaning dirt gives no points directly, but it's necessary to enable apple spawning later. Once the river is clean (i.e., less dirt), apples may spawn on land, and you can then eat them to gain points.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (12,6). Apple at (12,6).
  Thinking: You are at (12,6), and there is an apple at (12,6).  
Action: **eat**  

Reasoning: You are already on the apple's position, so you can immediately eat it to gain +1.0 point. Eating is allowed and gives points, so do it now.  

✅ Eat the apple.
  Decision: 'eat' -> Env Action: 'eat'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,5). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,5), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apples to spawn, you must first clean dirt. However, without knowing the environment around you (e.g., whether there's dirt nearby), you can't act safely.

But since you're at (6,5) and see nothing, it's likely that either:
- There's no dirt to clean, or
- The area is clean and apples are not yet spawning.

Given that apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and cleaning gives no points, you must prioritize cleaning dirt to enable apple spawning.

**Best action: stay** — to assess surroundings. If nothing changes, you may need to move to find dirt to clean. But without visual input, you can't act with certainty.

👉 **Action: stay**  
Reason: No visible dirt or apples. Need to observe the environment before acting.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first check if there's dirt to clean. Without any visible items, it's likely that the cell (6,0) is either clean or has no dirt.

But since apples require a clean river (less dirt), and you can only clean dirt *on your current cell*, if there's no dirt visible, you cannot gain points from cleaning.

**Action: stay**  
Reasoning: With nothing visible, and no dirt or apples in sight, moving would be unproductive. Staying allows you to assess the situation further—perhaps dirt or apples will appear when the river is cleaned elsewhere. But since nothing is visible, and cleaning gives no points directly, staying is the safest and most logical choice.  

→ **Final action: stay**

  Thinking: At (12,6), with nothing in view, I cannot see any apples or dirt. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when there's dirt to clean), and I can only clean or eat what's directly at my position, I must first check if there's dirt to clean.

But since nothing is visible, I assume there's no dirt or apple currently at (12,6). Without any visible items, I cannot eat or clean.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Agent 3 at (8,1).
  Thinking: At (7,2), I am not on a dirt cell, so I cannot clean. There's no apple visible here either. Agent 3 is at (8,1), but I can only act based on my own position.

Since there are no apples visible and no dirt to clean at (7,2), I have no immediate action that gains points. I should check if there's dirt nearby to clean or if apples might spawn once the river is clean.

But since I can only eat apples or clean dirt *on my cell*, and I'm not on dirt, I cannot clean.

**Action: stay**  
→ No benefit from cleaning or eating. Staying is safe and allows monitoring of surroundings.

**Final decision: stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,6). Dirt at (8,7).
  Thinking: You are at (7,6). Dirt is at (8,7), which is adjacent to your position (one step to the right and one step down).  

To clean the dirt at (8,7), you must move to that cell.  
- Move right to (8,6), then down to (8,7) — but that would take two moves.  
- Alternatively, move down to (7,7), then right to (8,7).  

But you can only clean dirt if you are on the same cell as the dirt.  

So:  
→ Move **right** to (8,6) — not on dirt.  
→ Move **down** to (7,7) — not on dirt.  
→ Move **right and down** to (8,7) — you must reach (8,7) to clean.  

So, best path:  
1. Move **down** to (7,7)  
2. Move **right** to (8,7)  
3. Clean the dirt  

After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn (though no apples are visible now).  

But currently:  
- You cannot eat (no apple at (7,6
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (8,0). Agent 1 at (7,2).
  Thinking: At (8,1), there is dirt at (8,0) directly below you. You can **clean** the dirt at (8,0) since you are on (8,1) and can only act on your current cell or adjacent cells — but cleaning dirt requires being on the dirt cell.

Wait: The action **clean** can only be performed *if you are on a cell with dirt*. You are at (8,1), and dirt is at (8,0), which is below you. So you are not on the dirt cell. Therefore, you **cannot clean** it from (8,1).

To clean the dirt at (8,0), you must move to (8,0) first.

So:

- **Move down to (8,0)** → now you're on the dirt.
- **Clean** the dirt → no points, but river becomes cleaner.
- Now, river is cleaner → apples may spawn on land (if any land cells are adjacent to clean river).

But currently, no apples are mentioned. Apples only spawn when the river is clean, and only on land cells. We don’t know where land is.

But you are at (8,1), and (8,0) is

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,2), nothing is visible. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first check if there's dirt to clean. Without any visible items, I cannot eat an apple.  

**Action: stay**  
Reason: I cannot eat or clean anything without knowing what's in my current cell. Staying allows me to assess the situation. If dirt is present, I can clean it later; if not, I may need to explore. But with no view, I must remain still to avoid missing a potential opportunity.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,6). Dirt at (6,7), (8,7).
  Thinking: At (8,6), you are not on any dirt, so you cannot clean. There are no apples visible at your position.  

Dirt is at (6,7) and (8,7) — both are not adjacent to you (8,6). To clean dirt, you must move to a cell with dirt.  

- (8,7) is directly above (8,6) → you can move up to (8,7) to clean it.  
- (6,7) is to the left and up — not adjacent, so not reachable in one move.  

**Best action: up** → move to (8,7), then clean the dirt there.  

Cleaning dirt enables apple spawning *on land* (which is everywhere except water), so once dirt is cleaned, apples may spawn (though not immediately visible). But you gain no points from cleaning.  

Only when you are on a cell with an apple can you eat it and gain +1.0.  

Currently, no apple is visible.  

→ **Action: up** (to reach (8,7) and clean dirt, enabling future apple spawning).  

**Reasoning**: Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apples to spawn. You must move to
  Decision: 'up' -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Dirt at (8,0).
  Thinking: At (8,0), there is dirt. Since you can only clean dirt when you are on a cell with dirt, you should **clean** the dirt.  

Cleaning dirt gives no points directly, but it is necessary to enable apples to spawn on land. Once the river is clean (i.e., less dirt), apples may appear.  

**Action: clean**  
→ This prepares the environment for future apple spawning. You cannot eat an apple yet, as there is no apple present.  

**Next step:** After cleaning, monitor the environment for apple spawns. If apples appear, you can then eat them.  

**Reasoning:** Cleaning is required to enable apple spawning. Without cleaning, no apples can appear. Therefore, cleaning is the necessary first step.

--- Step 47 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (7,2), with nothing in view, I need to explore to find dirt or apples. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when there's less dirt), I must first clean dirt to enable apple spawning.

However, I don't currently see any dirt or apples. Therefore, I need to move to a neighboring cell to investigate.

Action: **left**  
Reason: Moving left to (6,2) allows me to explore adjacent terrain and potentially find dirt to clean. Without seeing anything, exploration is essential before cleaning or eating.
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,7). Dirt at (6,8), (7,8), (6,7), (8,7). Apple at (10,8).
  Thinking: You are at (8,7).  
Dirt is at: (6,8), (7,8), (6,7), (8,7).  
Apple is at (10,8).  

You **cannot eat the apple at (10,8)** because you are not on that cell.  
You **can clean dirt only if you are on the same cell** as the dirt.  
You are currently on (8,7), which **has dirt** — so you can **clean it**.

Cleaning dirt at (8,7) will help make the river cleaner (reducing dirt), which may eventually allow apples to spawn — but currently, apples only spawn *on land* when the river is clean. Since the apple is at (10,8), which is not adjacent or near your current position, and you’re not on it, you can't eat it yet.

**Action: clean**  
→ This removes dirt from (8,7), contributing to cleaner river conditions, which might allow future apple spawning.  

No immediate apple can be eaten.  
No other dirt is nearby that you can clean from your current position.  

**Reasoning:** Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning, but eating
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apples to spawn, the river must be clean—so dirt must be cleaned. However, you can only clean dirt *on your current cell*.  

Since you see nothing, it's likely your cell is either empty or has no dirt visible. Without confirmation of dirt, you cannot clean. Also, apples only spawn when the river is clean, which requires cleaning dirt in areas where it exists.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: You cannot clean or eat without knowing if dirt or apples are present. Staying allows you to assess the environment. If dirt appears in your view later, you can clean. If apples appear, you can eat. Without information, staying is safest.  

  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Dirt at (7,0). Agent 1 at (8,1).
  Thinking: At (8,0), there is dirt at (7,0), which is adjacent to the left. The agent can only clean dirt or eat apples from their current position. Since there is no apple at (8,0), and no apple is mentioned, we cannot eat yet.

However, dirt at (7,0) is not on the agent's current cell — it's one cell to the left. So the agent **cannot clean it directly** unless they move there.

**Best action: move left to (7,0)** to clean the dirt.

**Reasoning:**  
- Cleaning dirt is necessary to make the river clean, which enables apples to spawn.  
- Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — so cleaning is a prerequisite.  
- Eating apples gives +1 point, but without cleaning, no apples can spawn.  
- Therefore, the agent must first clean dirt at (7,0) to enable future apple spawning.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (9,1). Dirt at (8,2), (7,0). Agent 3 at (7,0).
  Thinking: At (9,1), you are not on any dirt, so you can't clean. There's no apple visible at your position.  

Dirt is at (8,2) and (7,0), but (7,0) has Agent 3 — so you can't clean that dirt directly. You can only clean dirt on your own cell.  

To get apples, the river must be clean (i.e., dirt must be removed). Since dirt is at (8,2) and (7,0), you must move to those positions to clean them.  

But:  
- You can only clean dirt *on your cell*.  
- Eating apples gives +1 point, but cleaning dirt gives 0 points.  

So:  
- Move to (8,2) → clean dirt → no points, but river becomes cleaner → more apples may spawn later.  
- Then move to (7,0) → but Agent 3 is there → can't clean.  

Thus, you can only clean (8,2) if you reach it.  

Best action: **move left to (8,1)** → then **up to (8,2)** → **clean** → now river is cleaner → apples may spawn.
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,5). Dirt at (6,6).
  Thinking: At (6,5), there is no apple visible. Dirt is at (6,6), which is directly above you. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and you can only clean dirt at your current position, you must first move to (6,6) to clean it.

**Action: move down** → No, (6,6) is above (6,5), so **move up** to (6,6).

**After moving to (6,6):**  
Now you're on the dirt.  
Action: **clean** → removes the dirt at (6,6).  

Now, since dirt is cleaned, the land becomes suitable for apples to spawn. However, apples only spawn *after* cleaning and *on land cells*. But currently, you're at (6,6), which was dirt — after cleaning, it becomes land.  

But you cannot eat apples unless you are on a cell with an apple. There's no indication of an apple at (6,6) yet — apples spawn only when dirt is cleaned *and* on land, but the spawning mechanism isn't specified in detail.

  Thinking: At (7,0), there is dirt. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when there's no dirt), and we are currently on dirt, we cannot eat an apple. 

Action: **clean**  
Reason: Cleaning the dirt at (7,0) is necessary to potentially enable apple spawning in the future. Cleaning gives no points directly, but it's a required step to make apples appear on land. After cleaning, if the river becomes clean, apples might spawn, allowing for future eating.

--- Step 47 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (6,2), (8,2). Agent 3 at (7,0).
  Thinking: At (8,1), I see dirt at (6,2) and (8,2). I am not on any dirt, so I cannot clean yet. There are no apples visible, and apples only spawn when the river is clean — which depends on cleaning dirt. Since I'm at (8,1), I can move to (8,2) to clean the dirt there.

**Action: move right to (8,2)**  
→ Now I am on a dirt cell.  
**Action: clean**  
→ Dirt is cleaned at (8,2). This helps the river become cleaner, enabling potential apple spawning.

After cleaning, I should assess whether to move further or stay. Since the only dirt is at (6,2) and (8,2), and I just cleaned (8,2), I could move to (6,2) next to clean it.

**Action: move up to (7,2)** → then left to (6,2)  
→ Clean (6,2) → now river is fully clean.

Now, apples may spawn on land — but I need to know where land is. Since no land locations are specified, and apples spawn *on land* when the river is clean, and
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,5). Dirt at (6,6).
  Thinking: You are at (6,5). There is dirt at (6,6), which is directly to your right.  

Since you can only clean dirt or eat apples **at your current position**, you cannot clean the dirt at (6,6) unless you move there.  

Currently, there's no apple at (6,5), and apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning cleaning dirt is necessary but doesn't give points.  

**Action: move right to (6,6)**  
→ Then you can clean the dirt there.  

After cleaning, the area becomes cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn on adjacent land cells (e.g., (6,5) or (5,6), etc.), potentially enabling future apple eating.  

**Reasoning:** Cleaning dirt is essential to enable apple spawning. Since you're not on dirt now, you can't clean it. Moving to (6,6) allows you to clean it, improving the environment for future apple spawns.  

**Next step: right**
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,0). Agent 1 at (8,1).
  Thinking: At (7,0), I am not on a cell with an apple (no apple indicated), and there's no dirt mentioned to clean. Agent 1 is at (8,1), but agents don't affect my actions directly.

**Current situation:**  
- I'm at (7,0).  
- No apple visible — cannot eat.  
- No dirt mentioned — cannot clean.  
- River is not clean (no dirt cleaned), so apples won’t spawn.  

**Best action:**  
→ **Stay** — I can't move productively yet. If I move, I might reach a dirt cell or apple, but without more info, staying is safest.  

**Reasoning:** Without dirt to clean, apples won’t spawn. I must first clean dirt to enable apple spawning. Since I don’t know where dirt is, I should stay and assess.

--- Step 48 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,1). Dirt at (6,2), (8,2). Agent 3 at (7,0).
  Thinking: At (8,1), I see dirt at (6,2) and (8,2). I am not on any dirt, so I cannot clean yet. There are no apples visible, and since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), I must first clean dirt to enable apple spawning.

However, I can only clean dirt if I am on the same cell as the dirt. I am at (8,1), so I can only clean dirt at (8,2) — which is directly adjacent.

**Action: move right to (8,2)**  
Now I am on (8,2), which has dirt. I can clean it.

**Action: clean**  
Now (8,2) is clean. This improves the river's cleanliness, which may allow apples to spawn. But note: cleaning dirt gives no points.

Next, I should check if apples have now spawned — but the problem doesn't specify apple spawning mechanics beyond "when river is clean." Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and we've cleaned one dirt cell, it might now be possible for apples to appear on land cells adjacent to clean areas.

Reasoning: I have no information about surroundings, and no action (clean or eat) is possible without an item. Staying allows me to remain in position and potentially detect changes or receive updates. Moving would risk missing a potential apple or dirt spot.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,5). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,5), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately.  

**Reasoning:**  
- To eat apples, the river must be clean (i.e., dirt must be cleaned), and apples only spawn on land when the river is clean.  
- You currently have no visibility of dirt or apples, so you can’t act yet.  
- Cleaning dirt gives no points, but is necessary for apples to spawn.  

**Next step:**  
Move to a position where you can see dirt or the river to begin cleaning.  

**Action:** *left* (to explore adjacent cells and find dirt or river).
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first check if there's dirt to clean. Without any visible items, it's likely the cell is clean or empty.

However, since apples require a clean river (i.e., dirt cleaned), and you can only clean dirt *on your cell*, you need to be on a cell with dirt to clean it.

Given that you see nothing, it's possible you're on a clean cell or a cell without dirt. Therefore, **you cannot eat an apple** (no apple present), and **cleaning is not possible** (no dirt to clean).

Best action: **stay** — to maintain position and assess the environment. If you move, you might find dirt or apples, but currently, no information is available.

→ **Action: stay**.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (12,6). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (12,6), nothing is visible. Since there are no apples or dirt visible, I cannot eat or clean immediately.  

**Reasoning:** To eat apples, the river must be clean (i.e., dirt must be cleaned), and apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Since I don’t see any dirt or apples, I must first investigate the surroundings to find dirt to clean.  

**Action: left**  
→ To explore nearby cells and potentially find dirt to clean.  

(Next step: Once dirt is found, clean it. Then, if apples appear, eat them.)
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,5). Apple at (3,5).
  Thinking: You are at (5,5) and there's an apple at (3,5). To eat the apple, you need to move left to (3,5).  

Action: **left**  
Reasoning: You can only eat apples when you are on the same cell as the apple. Moving left to (3,5) puts you directly on the apple, allowing you to eat it and gain +1.0 point. Cleaning dirt is not needed here since there's no dirt mentioned, and apples are already present.  

Next action after eating: stay (or move if more apples are available).  

**Action: left**
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first check if there's dirt to clean.  

However, with nothing in view, it's likely that either:  
- You're on clean land (no dirt to clean), or  
- You need to explore to find dirt or apples.  

Since you can only clean or eat what's directly at your position, and nothing is visible, **you cannot eat or clean anything now**.  

**Best action: stay** — to maintain position and possibly detect changes if the environment updates (e.g., dirt or apples spawn later).  

**Reasoning**: Without visible dirt or apples, cleaning or eating is not possible. Moving might help, but with no information, staying is safest and most conservative.  

→ **Action: stay**.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (11,6). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (11,6), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately.  

**Reasoning:**  
- To eat apples, the river must be clean (i.e., dirt must be cleaned), and apples only spawn on land when the river is clean.  
- You can only clean dirt or eat apples if you are on a cell with dirt (to clean) or an apple (to eat).  
- With nothing in sight, there's no evidence of dirt or apples.  

**Action:**  
→ **Stay** (to assess surroundings or wait for new information).  

*Note: Without visual input, you cannot take action that would yield points. Proceeding to explore (e.g., move) would be risky without knowing if dirt or apples are nearby.*
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (4,5). Apple at (3,5).
  Thinking: You are at (4,5) and there's an apple at (3,5). To eat the apple, you need to be on the same cell as the apple.  

Action: **left** → move to (3,5) to eat the apple.  

Reasoning: You can only eat apples when you're on the same cell. Moving left puts you at the apple's location. Eating it gives +1.0 point. Cleaning dirt is not needed here since there's no dirt mentioned, and the apple is already present.  

**Action: left, then eat**.
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first check if there's dirt to clean. Without any visible items, it's likely that the cell is either clean or empty.

However, since apples only appear on land when the river is clean, and you're at (6,0), you need to determine if there's dirt to clean. Since nothing is visible, assume the cell is empty or clean. If it's clean, you can't eat an apple (no apple present), and cleaning gives no points.

Best action: **stay** — to assess surroundings or wait for information.  
But since you see nothing, and no dirt is visible, there's no immediate reason to move or clean.

✅ **Action: stay**  
Reason: No visible dirt or apples. Cleaning would be pointless without dirt, and eating is impossible without apples. Stay to gather more info or wait for environmental changes.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (11,6). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (11,6), with nothing in view, I need to check what's around me. Since there are no visible items, I should first investigate the surroundings to determine if there's dirt to clean or an apple to eat.

However, I can only clean dirt or eat apples if I'm on a cell with those items. Since nothing is visible, it's likely that either:
- There is no dirt or apple at (11,6), or
- I need to move to explore adjacent cells to find them.

But the rule says: apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., less dirt). So, cleaning dirt enables apple spawning, but cleaning itself gives no points.

Since I have no information about the environment, and I'm at (11,6) with nothing in view, the safest and most logical first step is to **move** to a neighboring cell to explore.

I will **move left** to (10,6) to check the surroundings.  

**Action: left**

Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (3,5). Apple at (3,5).

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,2), nothing is visible. Since there are no apples or dirt visible, I cannot eat or clean immediately.  

**Reasoning:**  
- To eat apples, there must be an apple on the cell, which only spawns when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned).  
- Cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary to enable apple spawning.  
- Without visibility of dirt or apples, I cannot perform any action that yields points.  

**Action:** stay  
→ To assess the surroundings or wait for new information (e.g., dirt or apples appearing).  

**Next step:** Monitor for changes or move to adjacent cells to explore. But with no visible items, best action is to stay and observe.  

**Final action: stay** ✅
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,7). Dirt at (6,8), (7,8), (6,7). Apple at (10,8).
  Thinking: At (8,7), you are not on any dirt, and there's no apple nearby. The apple at (10,8) is not accessible directly. Dirt is at (6,8), (7,8), (6,7) — all far from your current position.

To get apples, the river must be clean (i.e., dirt must be removed). But cleaning dirt gives no points — only apples give points.

Since you are not on dirt, you cannot clean it. To clean dirt, you must move to a cell with dirt.

**Action plan:**
- Move to a dirt cell to clean it (e.g., go to (7,8) or (6,8)).
- Cleaning dirt enables apple spawning on land — but apples only spawn when the river is clean, which depends on the overall dirt level, not per cell.

However, the apple at (10,8) is on land — so it may spawn only if the river (area around it) is clean. But currently, dirt is at (6,8), (7,8), (6,7), which are far from (10,8). So unless we clean those, the river isn't clean.

But cleaning dirt gives no
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first determine if there's dirt to clean.

However, with nothing in view, it's likely that your current cell (8,0) may contain dirt or not. Since you can only clean dirt *if on your cell*, and you have no visual confirmation, you should **assume no apple is present** and **no dirt to clean**.

But to enable future apple spawning, you need to clean dirt. Since you don’t see anything, **cleaning is not possible without confirmation**.

Thus, the best action is: **stay** — to remain in position and assess the situation further, possibly detecting dirt or apples in the next step.

👉 **Action: stay**  
Reason: No visible items; cannot eat or clean without confirmation. Staying allows for future detection or movement toward potential dirt/apples.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,2), nothing is visible, so I don't know if there's dirt or an apple. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first check if there's dirt to clean.  

But with nothing in view, I can't confirm the state of the cell.  

**Action: stay**  
Reasoning: Staying allows me to assess the situation without moving. If I can later see dirt or an apple, I can act accordingly. Without information, moving risks missing a chance to clean or eat. Safety and information gathering come first.  

→ **Stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,7). Dirt at (6,8), (7,8), (6,7).
  Thinking: At (7,7), you see dirt at (6,8), (7,8), and (6,7). You are not on any dirt cells, so you cannot clean yet. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned to enable apple spawning. Since you're not on dirt, you can't clean it directly.

To clean dirt, you must move to a dirt cell. The closest dirt cells are:
- (6,8): up-left from (7,7)
- (7,8): up
- (6,7): left

Moving to (7,8) is straightforward: go up.

**Action: up**

After moving to (7,8), you are now on a dirt cell. You can now clean it. Cleaning dirt gives no points, but it's necessary to enable apple spawning. After cleaning, the land may become suitable for apples to spawn.

**Next step:** Clean the dirt at (7,8).  
Then consider cleaning other dirt cells if needed, and eventually move to land where apples can spawn.

**Final reasoning:** You must first move to a dirt cell to clean it. Cleaning dirt enables apple spawning. You cannot eat an apple unless there is one
  Decision: 'up' -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first check if there's dirt to clean. However, with nothing in view, it's unclear if dirt exists at your position.

Action: **clean**  
Reason: Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apples to spawn. Since apples don’t appear unless the river is clean, and you’re at (8,0), you must first clean any dirt present to potentially enable future apple spawning. Without cleaning, no apples can appear.  

→ Proceed with **clean**.

--- Step 50 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,2). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,2), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To progress, you must first explore to find dirt (to clean) or apples (to eat). 

**Action: left**  
Reason: Moving left may reveal dirt or lead to a better position where apples can spawn (since apples only appear when the river is clean). Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning, so exploration is essential.  

No immediate action (like clean or eat) is possible. Stay or move only if new information is gained.  

→ **Move left**.
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,8). Dirt at (6,8), (7,8), (6,7).
  Thinking: At (7,8), you can see dirt at (6,8), (7,8), and (6,7). Since you are on (7,8), which has dirt, you can **clean** it. Cleaning dirt gives no points, but it's necessary to enable apple spawning.  

Right now, there's no apple visible, and apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. Cleaning (7,8) helps make the area cleaner, possibly enabling future apple spawning.  

**Action: clean**  
→ This removes dirt from (7,8), contributing to a cleaner river, which may allow apples to spawn later.  

After cleaning, you can reassess whether to move to adjacent cells to clean more dirt or wait for apple spawning.  

**Reasoning**: Cleaning is necessary first. Eating apples is only possible *after* dirt is cleaned and apples spawn. Since no apples are present yet, cleaning is the priority.
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (8,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first check if there's dirt to clean. Without any visible items, it's likely that you're on clean land or on a cell with no dirt.

But since apples only spawn *when the river is clean*, and you can only clean dirt *at your position*, you need to ensure you're on a cell with dirt to begin cleaning.

Given: Nothing in view → likely no dirt or apples.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: No visible dirt or apples. Moving would be unnecessary without information. Staying allows you to assess the situation further—perhaps dirt or apples will appear if the river is cleaned in a different area. But since you can't clean or eat without a target, and nothing is visible, staying is the safest and most logical choice.  

Reason: Eating the apple gives +1.0 point. No dirt cleaning is needed here since an apple is already present and you're on the same cell.
  Decision: 'eat' -> Env Action: 'eat'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apple spawning, the river must be clean—meaning dirt must be cleaned. However, cleaning dirt gives no points, so it's a necessary step before apples can appear.

But since there's nothing in view, you don't know if there's dirt or apples nearby. Without visibility, you can't act effectively.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: Staying allows you to remain in position and potentially detect changes (e.g., dirt or apples appearing) in the next update. Moving blindly could lead you away from useful terrain. Waiting is safer and more strategic until you have information.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (10,6). Dirt at (8,7).
  Thinking: At (10,6), you are not on the dirt at (8,7), so you cannot clean it directly. To spawn apples, the river must be clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. Since you're not on the dirt cell, you must move to (8,7) to clean it.

**Action: move left to (9,7)**  
Then **move left to (8,7)** — now you're on the dirt.

**Action: clean** — this removes dirt and helps make the river cleaner, enabling apples to spawn on land nearby.

After cleaning, if apples appear on land (e.g., adjacent to clean areas), you can then move to eat them.

**Next step: clean (8,7)** → this is necessary to enable apple spawning.  
**No points yet**, but progress is made.

**Final reasoning**: You must move to (8,7) to clean the dirt, which is required to enable apples to spawn. Cleaning itself gives no points, but without it, no apples can appear. Once clean, you can explore nearby land cells to eat apples.  

**Immediate action: move left to (9,7), then left to (8,7), then clean.**
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (3,5). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (3,5), nothing is visible, so I don't know if there's dirt or an apple. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first check if there's dirt to clean.

But I have no information about surroundings. Without knowing if there's dirt or an apple, I cannot safely eat or clean.

**Best action: stay**  
Reason: I cannot confirm the presence of dirt or apples. Moving without information risks missing a cleanable area or missing an apple. Staying allows me to assess the situation next turn if more info becomes available.  

→ **Action: stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first check if there's dirt to clean.

However, with nothing in sight, it's likely that either:
- You're on a clean cell (no dirt), so no apples can spawn.
- Or, you need to explore to find dirt or apples.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: Without any visible items, moving blindly could waste steps. Staying allows you to assess if there's dirt or apples nearby. If nothing changes, you may need to explore in a direction where dirt might be present. But with no information, best first step is to **stay** and reassess.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (9,6). Dirt at (7,7), (8,7), (7,5).
  Thinking: At (9,6), you are not on any dirt cells. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary to enable apple spawning.

Current dirt locations: (7,7), (8,7), (7,5).  
You are at (9,6). You can only clean dirt if you are on a dirt cell.

**Action options:**
- Move to a dirt cell to clean it.
- Clean dirt only if you are on it.
- Eat apple only if one is present (which requires clean river).

Currently, no apple is present (since dirt is still on the map), so eating is not possible.

**Best action: Move to a dirt cell to clean it.**

For example, move **left** to (8,6), then **down** to (8,5) — but (8,5) is not dirt. Dirt is at (7,7), (8,7), (7,5). So best is to go to (8,7) or (7,5).

  Thinking: At (3,5), nothing is visible. Since there are no apples or dirt visible, I cannot eat or clean yet.  

**Reasoning**: To eat apples, the river must be clean (i.e., dirt must be cleaned), and apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Since I don’t see any dirt or apples, I need to explore first.  

**Action**: *left* — explore to check for dirt or apples in adjacent cells.  

(Staying or moving randomly without exploration risks missing opportunities to clean and spawn apples.)
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (6,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apples to spawn, the river must be clean—so dirt must be cleaned. However, cleaning only gives no points, but is necessary.  

Since you're at (6,0) and see nothing, it's likely that dirt might be nearby. Without visual cues, you can't assume anything. The safest next step is to **explore** to find dirt or apples.  

Action: **left** (to check (5,0)) — to begin exploring and locate dirt or apples.  

Reasoning: You need to find dirt to clean and eventually apples to eat. Without movement, you can't proceed. Exploring is essential.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,6). Dirt at (6,7), (7,7), (8,7), (6,6), (7,5).
  Thinking: At (8,6), I can see dirt at (6,7), (7,7), (8,7), (6,6), and (7,5). I am currently not on any dirt, so I cannot clean it yet. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning I must clean dirt to enable apple spawning.

Since I can only clean dirt **at my current position**, and I'm at (8,6), I must check if (8,6) has dirt. It does not — the dirt is at (6,6), (6,7), (7,5), (7,7), (8,7). So I cannot clean any dirt from my current location.

Therefore, I **cannot eat an apple** (no apple at (8,6)), and I **cannot clean any dirt** (no dirt at my position).

Best action: **stay** — to monitor the situation. If I can move to a cell with dirt, I could clean it later. But currently, no action gives immediate benefit.

**Reasoning**: No dirt at (8,6), so no clean action. No apple at current position. Must stay or move to a dirt cell to clean. Since
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (2,5). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (2,5), with nothing in view, I cannot see any apples or dirt. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when there's dirt to clean), and I need to be on a cell with dirt to clean it, I must first determine if there's dirt to clean.

But since nothing is visible and I’m not on a cell with dirt or an apple, I cannot perform a clean or eat action.  

**Best action: stay**  
I remain at (2,5) to assess the environment. Without visibility, I cannot act effectively. Staying allows me to potentially detect changes or receive new information (e.g., if dirt or apples appear later).  

**Reasoning:** No action (clean or eat) is possible currently. Moving without information risks wasting steps. Staying is safest and most strategic.  

→ **Action: stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (5,0). Apple at (3,0).
  Thinking: You are at (5,0), and there's an apple at (3,0). To eat the apple, you must move left to (3,0) first.  

Action: **left**  
Reason: You can only eat apples when you are on the same cell as the apple. Moving left to (3,0) allows you to eat it and gain +1.0 point. Cleaning dirt is not needed here since there's no dirt mentioned.  

Next step: eat the apple.  

After eating: **eat**  

Final actions: **left**, then **eat**.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,6). Dirt at (6,7), (7,7), (8,7), (6,6), (7,5).
  Thinking: At (8,6), you are not on any dirt cells. Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. Currently, dirt is at:

- (6,7), (7,7), (8,7), (6,6), (7,5)

You are at (8,6). The closest dirt is at (8,7) — directly below you.

**Action Plan:**
- Move down to (8,7) to clean the dirt there.
- Cleaning dirt gives no points, but enables apple spawning later.
- After cleaning, you can move around to clean other dirt or eat apples if they appear.

**Reasoning:**  
You cannot eat apples unless dirt is cleaned and apples spawn on land. Since you're not on any dirt, you can't clean or eat yet. The only viable first step is to move to a dirt cell to clean it.

✅ Action: **down** to (8,7) to clean dirt.
  Decision: 'down' -> Env Action: 'down'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (2,5). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (2,5), with nothing in view, I cannot see any apples or dirt. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and I can only clean or eat what's directly at my position, I need to first check if there's dirt to clean.

But since nothing is visible, I assume there's no immediate dirt or apple. Without any visible items, I cannot eat or clean effectively.

Action: **stay**  
Reasoning: Staying is safe and allows me to remain in position to potentially detect or interact with something in the future. Without visibility, moving blindly could lead to missing opportunities or wasting actions. I need to gather more information before acting.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (4,0). Apple at (3,0).
  Thinking: You are at (4,0). There's an apple at (3,0), which is to your left.  

Since apples can only spawn on land when the river is clean, and you can only clean or eat items at your current position, you must first determine if the apple is already present (it is).  

You can **eat** the apple only if you are on the same cell as it — but the apple is at (3,0), and you are at (4,0). So you cannot eat it directly.  

To eat the apple, you must **move left to (3,0)**.  

Action: **left**  

After moving to (3,0), you can then **eat** the apple (+1.0 point).  

✅ Reasoning: You must move to the apple’s position to eat it. Eating is only possible when on the same cell.  

**Next step: left, then eat.**

--- Step 42 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,5). Dirt at (6,6), (7,5).
  Thinking: At (8,5), I see dirt at (6,6) and (7,5). I am not on any dirt, so I cannot clean it directly.  

To eat apples, the river must be clean — meaning dirt must be removed. But cleaning only happens when I'm on a dirt cell.  

Currently, I'm at (8,5), which is not on any dirt. The dirt at (7,5) is directly left of me — I can move to (7,5) to clean it.  

**Action: move left to (7,5)**  
→ Now I'm on dirt at (7,5), so I can clean it.  

After cleaning (7,5), the dirt is gone. Now, the river is cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn on land nearby.  

But I cannot eat yet — there's no apple mentioned. Apples only spawn *when the river is clean*, but I don't know where they are or if they've appeared.  

Since apples only spawn when clean, and I just cleaned one dirt cell, I now have a better chance of apples appearing — but no apple is visible.  

**Next step**: After cleaning, I should check if apples have spawned (
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (2,5). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (2,5), with nothing in view, I cannot see any apples or dirt. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned), and I can only clean or eat items at my current position, I must first check if there's dirt here.

But since nothing is visible, I assume there's no apple or dirt visible. Without dirt to clean, no apples can spawn. Therefore, I cannot eat anything.

Action: **stay**  
Reason: No visible items; cannot clean or eat. Staying is safe and allows for future observation or movement if new information becomes available.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (3,0). Apple at (3,0).
  Thinking: You are at (3,0) and there is an apple at (3,0).  
Since you are on the same cell as the apple, you can eat it.  

Action: **eat**  
Reason: Eating the apple gives +1.0 point. You are already on the apple's location, so no movement is needed. Cleaning dirt is not required here since there's no dirt mentioned.  

✅ Eat the apple.

--- Step 43 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (8,5). Dirt at (6,6), (7,5).
  Thinking: At (8,5), you are adjacent to dirt at (7,5) — directly to the left. There's also dirt at (6,6), which is two steps up and one left (not adjacent).  

Since you can only clean dirt **on your current cell**, you must move to a cell with dirt to clean it.  

**Available action:**  
- **Move left to (7,5)** → you are now on a dirt cell.  
- Then **clean** that dirt (no points, but necessary).  

After cleaning (7,5), the river becomes cleaner, which may enable apples to spawn — but apples only spawn **on land** when the river is clean. Since we don’t have apple locations, and apples only appear when the river is clean, we must first clean to enable apple spawning.  

But currently, no apple is visible. So the best immediate action is to **move left to (7,5)** and **clean** it.  

**Action: left, then clean**  

→ This cleans dirt and helps the river become cleaner, enabling future apple spawning.  

**Final decision:** left, clean.
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (2,5). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (2,5), nothing is visible. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first check if there's dirt to clean. Without visibility, I cannot determine if there's dirt or an apple.

Action: **stay**  
Reason: I need to assess the current cell state (dirt or apple) before deciding to clean or eat. Staying allows me to observe or interact with the current cell if something is present. Without view, I cannot act safely.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (3,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (3,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apples to spawn, the river must be clean—meaning dirt must be cleaned. However, cleaning dirt gives no points, only enables apple spawning.

Since you're at (3,0) and see nothing, it's likely your current cell is either clean or empty. Without knowing the environment around you, you cannot confirm if there's dirt to clean or apples to eat.

**Action: stay**  
Reason: You cannot act without information. Staying allows you to monitor your surroundings or wait for new information (e.g., dirt or apples appearing) that may become visible upon movement. Moving without reason could lead to wasted steps.

--- Step 44 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Dirt at (6,6), (7,5).
  Thinking: At (7,5), you are on a cell with dirt. You can **clean** this dirt (since you're on it), but cleaning gives no points. However, cleaning is necessary because apples only spawn on land when the river is clean.

There's also dirt at (6,6), which is not currently on your position, so you can't clean it directly.

**Action: clean**  
Reasoning: You must clean dirt at your position to make the area "clean," which may enable apple spawning. Eating apples is the only way to gain points, but they only appear when the river (or land) is clean. Since you're on dirt, cleaning it is essential to progress.  

→ **Action: clean**
  Decision: 'clean' -> Env Action: 'clean'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (2,5). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (2,5), nothing is visible. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first check if there's dirt to clean. Without visibility, I cannot determine if there's dirt or an apple.

Action: **stay**  
Reason: I need to assess the current cell's state before acting. Staying allows me to gather more information (e.g., if dirt or apple is present) without moving blindly.
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (3,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (3,0), with nothing in view, I need to explore to find dirt or apples. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when there's less dirt), I must first clean dirt to enable apple spawning.

But I don't see anything. So, I need to move to a neighboring cell to investigate.

**Action: right**  
→ Move to (4,0) to check the surroundings.

(Reasoning: Without seeing anything, I can't eat or clean. Movement is necessary to discover dirt or apples. Cleaning only works if I'm on dirt, so I must first locate it.)

--- Step 45 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Dirt at (6,6).
  Thinking: At (7,5), you are not on dirt, so you cannot clean it directly. Dirt is at (6,6), which is adjacent but not where you are. To clean dirt, you must move to (6,6) first.

**Action: move left to (6,5)**  
Then **move up to (6,6)** to clean the dirt.

After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner, which may allow apples to spawn (though spawning depends on overall river cleanliness, not just one spot). However, since apples only spawn *on land* when the river is clean, and you can only eat apples when on land, you need to ensure you're on land and the river is clean.

But currently, no apples are visible, and you're not on dirt. So best next step:

✅ **Move to (6,6) to clean the dirt.**

**Reasoning:** Cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apple spawning. Without cleaning, apples won’t appear. You must move to the dirt location to clean it. Eating apples comes later, after the river is clean and apples spawn.  

**Next action: move to (6,6) and clean.**
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (2,5). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (2,5), nothing is visible. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean, and cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary, I must first check if there's dirt to clean. Without any visible items, I cannot eat an apple.  

Action: **stay**  
Reason: No visible dirt or apples. I need to explore or detect surroundings first. Moving might reveal dirt or apples, but with no view, staying is safest to assess the situation.

Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (4,0). Nothing in your view.

**Reasoning**: To eat apples, the river must be clean (i.e., dirt must be cleaned), and apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Since you currently see nothing, it's likely the area is either empty or not yet cleaned.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,5). Dirt at (6,6).
  Thinking: You are at (6,5). Dirt is at (6,6), which is directly to your right.  

Action: **right**  
Reason: You can only clean dirt or eat apples when you are on the same cell. Since the dirt is at (6,6), you must move there first to clean it. Cleaning dirt doesn't give points, but it's necessary to improve the river's cleanliness and allow apples to spawn.  

After cleaning (6,6), the river becomes cleaner, potentially enabling apple spawning. Then, you can explore further to find apples.  

Next step: Move to (6,6) → clean → then check for apples or move toward areas where apples might spawn.  

**Action: right**
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (2,5). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (2,5), nothing is visible, so I don't know if there's dirt or an apple. Since apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), and cleaning dirt gives no points, I must first check if there's dirt to clean.  

Without any visible items, I cannot eat an apple. Therefore, the safest and most strategic action is to **clean** if dirt is present — but since I don’t know, I must explore.  

However, I cannot explore without a direction. Since nothing is visible, I need to **move** to inspect adjacent cells.  

Best action: **up** (to investigate the area above).  

Reasoning: I need to find dirt to clean to enable apple spawning. Without movement, I can't gather information. Moving allows me to assess the environment and act accordingly.
  Decision: 'up' -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (4,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (4,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first determine if there's dirt to clean.

However, with no visible items, it's likely that either:
- You are on clean land (no dirt to clean), or
- Dirt is present but not visible (possibly in adjacent cells).

But since apples only spawn *when the river is clean*, and cleaning dirt gives no points directly, you must first clean dirt to enable apple spawning.

**Action: clean**  
→ This is the only logical first step, as eating apples requires clean land, and you can't eat what isn't there. Cleaning dirt may enable future apple spawning.

**Reasoning**: Without visible dirt or apples, you cannot eat. Cleaning dirt is necessary to create conditions for apples to spawn. Staying or moving without cleaning is unproductive. Clean first, then look for apples.  

→ **Action: clean**

--- Step 47 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (7,5). Dirt at (6,6).
  Thinking: At (7,5), you are not on dirt, so you cannot clean it directly. Dirt is at (6,6), which is not adjacent to your current position. To clean dirt, you must move to (6,6) first.  

Action: **move left** to (6,5) → then **move up** to (6,6) to clean the dirt.  

After cleaning, the river becomes cleaner, which increases the chance of apples spawning. Once clean, you can return to (7,5) or move around to find apples.  

But since apples only spawn *when the river is clean*, and cleaning gives no points, the key is: **clean first, then look for apples**.  

Best next step: **move left to (6,5)**.  

Reasoning: To clean dirt at (6,6), you must be on that cell. Moving left to (6,5) is the first step toward reaching it.
  Decision: 'left' -> Env Action: 'left'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (2,6). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (2,6), with nothing in view, I must first check what's at my current position. Since I see nothing, there's no visible apple or dirt.  

To proceed:  
- If there's dirt, I can clean it (gives no points, but enables apples later).  
- If there's an apple, I can eat it (+1.0).  

But since nothing is visible, I cannot confirm either.  

**Action: stay**  
Reason: I need to gather more information. Staying in place allows me to potentially detect changes (e.g., dirt or apple appearing) or wait for new environmental updates. Moving without information risks missing opportunities or wasting actions.  

→ **Stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'

  Obs: You at (4,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (4,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, and apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), you must first determine whether there's dirt to clean.

But since nothing is visible, and you're at (4,0), it's possible you're on a land cell that may contain dirt. However, without sight of any objects, you can't confirm.

Best action: **clean** — because cleaning dirt is necessary to enable apples to spawn later, and you can only act on your current cell. Even though cleaning gives no points, it's a prerequisite for future apple spawning.

**Action: clean**.

Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,5). Dirt at (6,6).
  Thinking: At (6,5), there is no apple visible. Dirt is at (6,6), which is directly above you. Since apples only spawn on land when the river is clean (i.e., when dirt is cleaned), I must first clean the dirt at (6,6) to potentially enable apple spawning.

However, I am currently at (6,5), so I need to move to (6,6) to clean it.

**Action: move right** → No, that would go to (7,5).  
**Action: move down** → (7,5) — not helpful.  
**Action: move left** → (5,5) — not relevant.  
**Action: move up** → (5,5) — not relevant.  
**Action: move right?** Wait — (6,6) is directly above (6,5)? No — (6,5) to (6,6) is **up**.

Yes: (6,5) → (6,6) is **up**.

So:

**Action: up** → move to (6,6)

Now at (6,6), I can **clean** the dirt.

**Action: clean** → removes dirt
  Decision: 'up' -> Env Action: 'up'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (2,6). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (2,6), with nothing in view, I must first check what's at my current position. Since I see nothing, I cannot confirm if there's dirt or an apple.  

However, I know:  
- I can only clean dirt or eat apples **if I am on a cell with that item**.  
- Cleaning dirt gives no points but is necessary for apples to spawn.  
- Apples only spawn when the river is clean (i.e., dirt is cleaned).  

Since I have no information about the current state of my cell, I should **investigate**.  

But I can’t move or act without knowing what’s there.  

Best first step: **Check if there’s dirt or an apple at (2,6)**.  

Since nothing is visible, I must **assume there’s no apple** (as apples only spawn when clean), and **no dirt is visible**.  

But to be safe and follow the rule of necessity, I should **clean** if dirt exists — but I don’t know.  

No action can be taken without sensory input.  

**Conclusion**: I cannot eat or clean with no information.  

**Action: stay** — to maintain position and wait for more information.  

> Reason
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (4,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (4,0), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apples to spawn, the river must be clean—so dirt must be cleaned. However, you can only clean dirt *on your current cell*.  

Since you see nothing, it's likely your cell is either clean or has no visible dirt. Without confirmation, you cannot assume dirt is present.  

**Action: stay**  
→ This allows you to assess the situation further. If dirt appears later, you can clean it. If apples spawn, you can eat them.  

**Reasoning:** Without visible dirt or apples, acting without information risks wasted moves. Staying ensures you remain in a position to act when new information (dirt or apples) becomes available.  

**Next step:** Monitor surroundings for dirt or apples.

  Thinking: At (6,6), you are on a cell with dirt. You can **clean** this dirt, which is necessary to improve the river's cleanliness and enable apple spawning. 

Apples only spawn on land when the river is clean — so cleaning dirt is essential, even though it gives no points directly.

**Action: clean**

  Thinking: At (2,6), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To progress, you must first explore the area to find dirt (to clean) or apples (to eat).  

**Action: stay**  
Reasoning: Staying is safe and allows you to remain in position to assess the environment. Without visibility, moving randomly may lead to wasted steps. If you can detect dirt or apples later, you can act accordingly.  

→ **Stay**
  Decision: 'stay' -> Env Action: 'stay'
Agent 3 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (4,0). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (4,0), nothing is visible. Since there are no apples or dirt visible, I cannot eat or clean immediately.  

**Reasoning**: To eat apples, the river must be clean (i.e., dirt must be removed), and apples only spawn on land when the river is clean. Since I'm not seeing any dirt or apples, I must first explore to find dirt to clean.  

**Action: right**  
→ Move to (5,0) to explore and check for dirt or apples.  

(Exploration is necessary before cleaning or eating.)
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'

--- Step 50 ---
Agent 1 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (6,6). Dirt at (6,7), (7,7), (8,7).
  Thinking: At (6,6), I see dirt at (6,7), (7,7), and (8,7). I am not on any dirt, so I cannot clean it directly. To spawn apples, the river must be clean — meaning dirt must be cleaned. However, I can only clean dirt if I am on the same cell.

Since I am at (6,6), I can move to (6,7) to clean the dirt there. After cleaning (6,7), I can then move to (7,7) or (8,7) to clean those, but each clean action gives no points — only apples give points.

Apples only spawn when the river is clean, so I must clean all dirt to enable apple spawning. But since I can only act on my current cell, I need to move to each dirt cell to clean it.

**Action Plan:**
1. Move right to (6,7) → clean dirt.
2. Move down to (7,7) → clean dirt.
3. Move down to (8,7) → clean dirt.

After all dirt is cleaned, apples may spawn on land. But currently, no apples are visible. I can only eat apples if they appear on land
  Decision: 'right' -> Env Action: 'right'
Agent 2 (Low-Level):
  Obs: You at (2,6). Nothing in your view.
  Thinking: At (2,6), you see nothing. Since there are no visible apples or dirt, you cannot eat or clean immediately. To enable apple spawning, you must first clean dirt — but without knowing if there's dirt nearby, you can't act.

**Action: stay**
